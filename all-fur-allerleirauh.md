65. — Allerleirauh.

Consists of stories from Hesse and Paderborn ; the last varies in some particulars. The maiden puts the mantle of all kinds of fur — en which moss or whatever else she can pick up in the forest is sewn — over the three bright dresses, and escapes into the forest. Then, for fear of the wild beasts, she climbs up a high tree, and sleeps, resting on the branches. In the morning some wood-cutters come to get wood for the King's court ; they cut down the tree on which Allerleirauh is still sleeping, but it falls slowly, so she is not hurt. She awakes in a fright, but when she sees that she is among kind people she begs them to take her away with them. " Yes," they say; "get into the wood-cart there, hairy animal." They drive to the King's court, and she serves in the kitchea. As she has made some very good soup, the King sends for her, and says, " Thou ait indeed a pretty child ; come and seat thyself on my chair." Then he lays his head on her lap, and says, " Comb my hair a little." She does it, and henceforth has to do it every noon. One day while she is doing it he sees her shining star-dress glittering through the sleeve of her mantle, and tears it off; there she stands as the most beautiful princess in the world. According to a third story, from the neighbourhood of Paderborn, Allerleirauh pretends to be dumb. The King one day strikes her with the whip, and the fur-mantle is torn, and the gold dress shines through it. The King makes the rent larger, and she is discovered. The punishment of the father, too, follows in both stories. He himself has to pronounce the sentence that he does not deserve to be King any longer. A fourth story begins differently. Allerleirauh is driven away by a step-mother because a foreign prince has given a betrothal ring to her and not to the step-mother's daughter. Afterwards Allei-leirauh arrives at the court of her lover, does menial work, and cleans his shoes, but is discovered, as she lays the betrothal ring among the white bread, as in another saga it is put in the strong broth. (Musaus, 2, 188.) When the King will marry no girl whose hair is not like that of the dead Queen, we are reminded of an incident in the Fdroische Sage, where the bereaved King will marry no one whom the dead Queen's clothes do not fit. Sagahihliothek, 2, 481. There is a very flat version of the story in one from the Zillerthal, Zingerle, p. 231. Compare No. 48 in Meier, and No. 10 in Prohle's Mdrchen fur die Jugend. The story has some affinity to that of AschenpiiUel, and Perrault's Peau (i'J.we belongs to this group; so does the story oiDoralice in Straparola (1. 4), especially the beginning of it. In the Pentamerone see The She-hear (2. 6). In Wallachian, The Emperor's Daughter in the Pig-stye, No 3 in Schott.
