10. THE GOLDEN BALL. ( Yorkshire.)

There were two lasses, daughters of one mother, and as they came home from t'fair, they saw a right bonny young man stand it house-door before them . They niver seed such a bonny man afore. He had gold on t' cap, gold on t' finger, gold on neck, a red gold watch-chain - eh! but he had brass . He had a golden ball in each hand. He gave a ball to each lass, and she was to keep it, and if she lost it, she was to be hanged.

One o'the lasses, 't was t' youngest, lost her ball. [I'll tell thee how . She was by a park-paling, and she was tossing her ball, and it went up, and up, and up, till it went fair over t' paling; and when she climbed up to look, t' ball ran along green grass, and it went raite forward to t'door of t'house, and t' ball went in and she saw 't no more.]

So she was taken away to be hanged by t' neck till she were dead, a cause she'd lost her ball.

[But she had a sweetheart, and he said he would get ball. So he went tu't park-gate, but 't was shut; so he climbed hedge, and when he got tut top of hedge, an old woman rose up out of t' dyke afore him, and said, if he would get ball, he must sleep three nights in t' house. He said he would.

Then he went into t' house, and looked for ball, but could na find it. Night came on and he heard spirits move it courtyard; so he looked out o' t' window, and t’ yard was full of them, like maggots in rotten meat.

Presently he heard steps coming upstairs. He hid behind door, and was as still as a mouse. Then in came a big giant five times as tall as he were, and giant looked round but did not see t' lad, so he went tut window and bowed to look out; and as he bowed on his elbows to see spirits it yard , t' lad stepped behind him, and wi’ one blow of his sword he cut him in twain, so that the top part of him fell in the yard, and t bottom part stood looking out of t'window .

There was a great cry from t' spirits when they saw half the giant come tumbling down to them, and they called out, " There comes half our master, give us t' other half.'

So the lad said , 'It's no use of thee, thou pair of legs , standing aloan at window , as thou hast no een to see with, so go join thy brother;' and he cast the bottom part of t giant after top part. Now when the spirrits had gotten all t' giant they were quiet .

Next night t' lad was at the house again, and now a second giant came in at door, and as he came in tlad cut him in twain, but the legs walked on tut chimney and went up them . 'Go, get thee after thy legs,' said t'lad tut head, and he cast t' head up chimney too.

The third night t' lad got into bed , and he heard spirits striving under the bed , and they had t' ball there, and they was casting it to and fro.

Now one of them has his leg thrussen out from under bed, so t’ lad brings his sword down and cuts it off. Then another thrusts his arm out at other side of the bed, and t' lad cuts that off. So at last he had maimed them all , and they all went crying and wailing off, and forgot t' ball, but he took it from under t' bed, and went to seek his truelove.]

Now t’ lass was taken to York to be hanged; she was brought out on t' scaffold , and t' hangman said, 'Now , lass, tha' must hang by t' neck till tha be’st dead .' But she cried out:

Stop, stop, I think I see my mother coming!  
Oh mother, hast brought my golden ball  
And come to set me free ?

I've neither brought thy golden ball  
Nor come to set thee free,  
But I have come to see thee hung  
Upon this gallows-tree.

Then the hangman said, " Now, lass, say thy prayers, for tha must dee. " But she said:

Stop, stop, I think I see my father coming!  
O father, hast brought my golden ball  
And come to set me free ?

I've neither brought thy golden ball  
Nor come to set thee free,  
But I have come to see thee hung  
Upon this gallows -tree.

Then the hangman said, 'Hast thee done thy prayers? Now ,lass, putthy head intut noo-is.'

But she answered, " Stop, stop, I think I see my brother coming! &c. After which, she excused herself because she thought she saw her sister coming, then her uncle, then her aunt, then her cousin, each of which was related in full; after which the hangman said, 'I wee-nt stop no longer, tha's making gam of me. Tha must be hung at once.'

But now she saw her sweetheart coming through the crowd, and he had over head i' t' air her own golden ball; so she said:

Stop, stop, I see my sweetheart coming!
Sweetheart, hast brought my golden ball  
And come to set me free ?

Aye, I have brought thy golden ball  
And come to set thee free;  
I have not come to see thee hung  
Upon this gallows-tree .

The portions of this curious tale which are enclosed within brackets were obtained from a different informant. It seems to be a Yorkshire version of Grimm's 'Fearless John'

(Kinder-Mährchen , 4) . In both these is the giant cut in half, and the incident of the chimney, and also the wonderful bed.

In one of Grimm's versions of the tale, the lad is able to overcome the spirits by means of a stick which he obtained from a dead man on the gallows, the man having been hung for a theft which he had not committed. The boy brings him to Christian burial, and in reward obtains the stick.

In the Yorkshire story, the lad saves a girl from the gallows by means of a golden ball he had recovered from the spirits. There is a family likeness in the tales .

The other portion of the story resembles the popular Essex game of 'Mary Brown,' which is thus played:

The children form a ring, one girl kneeling in the centre; those in the ring sing out:

Here we all stand round the ring,  
And now we shut poor Maryin .  
Rise up, rise up, poor MaryBrown  
And see your poor mother go through the town.

To this she answers:

I will not rise upon my feet  
To see my poor mother go through the street.

The children bid her rise to see her poor father, then her brother, her sister, the poor beggars go through the street, and lastly, her poor sweetheart, whereupon she rises to her feet.

The Swedish 'Fair Gundela' also resembles it.

Why row ye so? Why row ye so?  
Fair Gundela  
GUNDELA.  
Sure I may row, sure I may row ,  
Whilst the grass groweth  
All summer through.  
Now I have heard that your father is dead,  
Fair Gundela!  
GUNDELA .  
What matters my father?  
My mother lives still.  
Thank Heaven for that!

She is then informed that her mother, brother, sister, &c., are all dead, and she invariably has some consolation to offer to herself; but when she is told that her true love is dead she is inconsolable.

```

The same text appears in *The Gentleman's magazine*, January, 1890, in an article entitled *The Philosopher's Stone* by Sabine Baring Gould, with the "Golden Ball" tale at [pp](64-66) introduced as:

> The following story I give as it was told to me by some Yorkshire mill lasses, in their own delightful vernacular. I forewarn the reader that the golden ball in the story is the same as the Philosopher's Stone, as we shall hear presently:

and with a slightly different *addendum*:

> In this very curious story, the portion within brackets reminds one of the German story of " Fearless John," in Grimm (K. M. 4), of which I remember obtaining an English variant in a chap-book in Exeter when I was a child, alas! now lost. It is also found in Iceland,' and is indeed a widely-spread tale. The verses are like others found in Essex in connection with the child's game of" Mary Brown," and those of the Swedish " Fair Gundela." But these points we must pass over. Our interest attaches specially to the golden ball. I'he story is almost certainly the remains of an old religious myth. The golden ball which one sister has is the sun, the silver ball of the other sister is the moon. The sun is lost; it sets, and the trolls, the spirits of darkness, play with it under the bed, that is, in the house of night, beneath the earth.
>
> But the sun is not only a golden ball, but it is also a shining stone; and here at the outset we tell our secret; the sun is the truePhilosopher's Stone, that turns all to gold, that gives health, that fills with joy.

*Fearless John* is presumably the boy who set out to find fear/did not know what fear was.

The Golden Ball

THERE were two lasses, daughters of one mother, and as they came from the fair, they saw a right bonny young man stand at the house-door before them. They never saw such a bonny man before. He had gold on his cap, gold on his finger, gold on his neck, a red gold watch-chain eh! but he had brass. He had a golden ball in each hand. He gave a ball to each lass, and she was to keep it, and if she lost it, she was to be hanged. One of the lasses, 'twas the youngest, lost her ball. I'll tell thee how. She was by a park-paling, and she was tossing her ball, and it went up, and up, and up, till it went fair over the paling; and when she climbed up to look, the ball ran along the green grass, and it went right forward to the door of the house, and the ball went in and she saw it no more.

So she was taken away to be hanged by the neck till she was dead because she'd lost her ball.

But she had a sweetheart, and he said he would go and get the ball. So he went to the park-gate, but 'twas shut; so he climbed the hedge, and when he got to the top of the hedge, an old woman rose up out of the dyke before him, and said, if he wanted to get the ball, he must sleep three nights in the house. He said he would.

Then he went into the house, and looked for the ball, but could not find it. Night came on and he heard bogles move in the courtyard; so he looked out o' the window, and the yard was full of them.

Presently he heard steps coming upstairs. He hid behind the door, and was as still as a mouse. Then in came a big giant five times as tall as he, and the giant looked round but did not see the lad, so he went to the window and bowed to look out; and as he bowed on his elbows to see the bogles in the yard, the lad stepped behind him, and with one blow of his sword he cut him in twain, so that the top part of him fell in the yard, and the bottom part stood looking out of the window.

There was a great cry from the bogles when they saw half the giant come tumbling down to them, and they called out, " There comes half our master, give us the other half."

So the lad said, " It's no use of thee, thou pair of legs, standing alone at the window, as thou hast no eye to see with, so go join thy brother "; and he cast the lower part of the giant after the top part. Now when the bogles had gotten all the giant they were quiet.

Next night the lad was at the house again, and now a second giant came in at door, and as he came in the lad cut him in twain, but the legs walked on to the chimney and went up them. " Go, get thee after thy legs," said the lad to the head, and he cast the head up the chimney too.

The third night the lad got into bed, and he heard the bogles striving under the bed, and they had the ball there, and they were casting it to and fro.

Now one of them has his leg thrust out from under bed, so the lad brings his sword down and cuts it off. Then another thrusts his arm out at other side of the bed, and the lad cuts that off. So at last he had maimed them all, and they all went crying and wailing off, and forgot the ball, but he took it from under the bed, and went to seek his truelove.

Now the lass was taken to York to be hanged; she was brought out on the scaffold, and the hangman said, " Now, lass, thou must hang by the neck till thou be'st dead." But she cried out:

'Stop, stop, I think I see my mother coming!  
Oh mother, hast brought my golden ball  
And come to set me free?"

'I've neither brought thy golden ball  
Nor come to set thee free,  
But I have come to see thee hung  
Upon this gallows-tree."

Then the hangman said, " Now, lass, say thy prayers for thou must die." But she said:

"Stop, stop, I think I see my father coming!

father, hast brought my golden ball And come to set me free?"

"I've neither brought thy golden ball

Nor come to set thee free,  
But I have come to see thee hung  
Upon this gallows-tree."

Then the hangman said, " Hast thee done thy prayers? Now, lass, put thy head into the noose."

But she answered, " Stop, stop, I think I see my brother coming!" And again she sang, and then she thought she saw her sister coming, then her uncle, then her aunt, then her cousin; but after this the hangman said, " I will stop no longer, thou'rt making game of me. Thou must be hung at once."

But now she saw her sweetheart coming through the crowd, and he held over his head in the air her own golden ball; so she said:

"Stop, stop, I see my sweetheart coming!  
Sweetheart, hast brought my golden ball  
 And come to set me free?"

"Aye, I have brought thy golden ball And come to set thee free,

1 have not come to see thee hung Upon this gallows-tree."

And he took her home, and they lived happy ever after.

Parallels. Mr. Nutt gave a version in Folk-Lore Journal, vi. 144. The man in instalments occurs in "The Strange Visitor " (No. xxxii.). The latter part of the tale has been turned into a game for English children, " Mary Brown," given in Miss Plunket's Merry Games, but not included in Newell, Games and Songs of American Children.

Remarks. This story is especially interesting as having given rise to a game. Capture and imprisonment are frequently the gruesome motif "of children's games, as in " Prisoner's base." Here it has been used with romantic effect.

An old Ballad. —Has the following ballad ever been printed, and if so, where? I heard it from a relative of Dr. Birkbeck Hill’s, in whose family it is tradtiional. A young man on his way to the gallows appeals to his parents and brethren in the following terms:—

"Hold up, hold up your hands so high,  
Hold up your hands so high,  
For I think I see my own mother coming o'er yonder stile to me.

Oh mother hast thon any gold for me,  
Any money to bay me free.

To save my body from the cold clay ground and my head from the gallows tree?

"Mother, father, and brethren all refuse him aid;—

"Oh no, I have no gold for thee.  
No money to buy thee free,
For I have come to see thee hanged, and hanged thou shalt be."

But his sweetheart is kinder and buys him off. At the end of each verse is the refrain—

"Oh the briars, the prickly briars.  
They prick my heart fall sore.  
If ever I get free  
From the gallows tree  
I never get there any more."

Alfred Nutt.

```{admonition} The Golden Balls - Day of the Dead storytelling by Sarah Liisa Wilkinson

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVLjtO4EkFQ, Circk Crack Club

There were two sisters walking through the cobbled streets of the little town where they lived, when they stopped, because they saw standing in front of a doorway this brilliant man.

He was so brilliant that he shone gold, because he had gold around his neck, he had gold around his wrists, he had gold upon his fingers, he had gold at his waist, and he was juggling golden balls so fast it was like he had a golden halo around his face.

And the sisters stared and the man smiled under the warmth of their attention, and then quick as a flash without missing a beat the man threw the sisters a golden ball each.

And as they gazed into the golden reflections of their own faces, the man told them that those balls were theirs to keep now, but if they ever lost them, they would be taken away to be hanged.

He didn't make the rules.

The girls took their balls and younger sister she kept her ball to herself. She didn't like anybody else looking at it. She took it out when she was home alone and she played with it and she polished it but for the rest of the time she wrapped it in handkerchief and she kept it in the front pocket of her apron. The older sister well she let everyone have a look at hers.

She walked down the street, tossing it into the air and catching it with a really satisfying smack of her palm.

Sometimes she caught it at the front, sometimes she caught it at the back when she was feeling fancy and the lads and the lasses on the street.

They called out as she went by and said, "Woohey! That's a very fine ball, you've got yourself there, girl."

An older sister smiled and said, "I know, but thank you for noticing."

And she threw it high and she caught it.

And she threw it high and she caught it.

And she threw it so high that she missed the catch.

And that golden ball sailed in an arc over the park gate.

It rolled down a little grassy path out the other side of the park, down a street and into the open doorway of a house that stood by itself beyond the end of the street.

And before, older sister could catch it up. The door to that house. Shut up.

Well, she knocked on the door.

You know, she tapped on the windows.

She called through the letterbox, but nobody answered.

Whatever she did, she couldn't get in that house.

So she had to leave, go home, empty handed, and people noticed the difference.

As she walked down the streets, the lads and lads, "No, you've lost your ball."

An older sister said, "No. Actually, I have not lost my ball because I know exactly where it lies. And if I could just get in that house, then you would see with your own eyes."

And she said the same thing to her mother and her father who were horrified. She said the same thing to younger sister who was really worried.

She said the same thing to the men of the law who turned up at her door and dragged her away to jail she said the same thing to the judge as she stood in the dock and he condemned her to death for losing her golden ball she said "I have not lost my golden ball I know just where it lies and if someone would go and fetch it for me then you would see with your own eyes". But nobody offered to go: not the men of the law, not the lads on Lassie the Street, not even her own parents.

He went home and said to younger sister, "well, at least we've got one daughter who keeps her ball to herself. At least we've got one child not bringing shame upon the family. Your sister is going to hang in the morning, by the way. But as far as we're concerned, she's already dead."

Younger sister was having one of those moments, you know, when you're a child and you suddenly realize for the first time that your parents aren't just your parents, they're also terrible human beings. And you know, younger sister was small and younger sister was shy but younger sister was no way going to let older sister die and so once her parents had gone to bed that night, younger sister crept out the house and then younger sister crept down the street and then younger sister crept through the park gate it was locked but she was small enough to get through the railing she crept down the grassy path she crept out the other side of the park she crept down the street and then she had to stop creeping for just a moment because at her feet in the ground was a ditch and from that ditch she could hear it was the old woman who lived in the ditch she was very wheezy she had a wrinkled puckered face she had wrinkled puckered fingers and hands and she had a resplendent bonnet And the old woman asked younger sister what she was doing out alone so late and younger sister said "I must go and get older sister's ball". And the old woman said "right okay then, yeah yeah, well, if you want to get that ball back, you're gonna have to stay in that house. Yeah that one, there, really scary looking one, for three nights".

"But I can't stay there for three nights because older sister will hang tomorrow morning. Oh, oh dear. Um, well look, I mean I could suppose you could try doing it all in one night but um, I mean I'm gonna warn you right now it's gonna be very intense. Look, I'm gonna give you three pieces of advice mainly because I feel very sorry for you just now. Piece of advice number one, use what you've got and use it wisely and well. Piece of advice number two, don't get distracted and piece of advice number three, try not to die in the house. The younger sister thanked the older woman for the advice and she walked up to the house.

She lifted her hand to knock on the door but before she even touched it, it opened for her without a sound and younger sister stepped into the house.

And it was dark in the house and it was cold in the house and it was dusty and musty in the house ahead of her with a small flight of stairs. She climbed up the stairs and she opened the door that stood at the top and when she looked inside the room her sister's golden ball wasn't there.

All that was there were these two massive savage black caps with burning red eyes and claws and fangs and they hissed and they snarled at younger sister but she was only there for one night so she didn't have time to deal with them so she just closed the door and she took the second flight of stairs. She opened the door at the top of those. She looked inside the room but her sister's golden wall wasn't there either. All that was in that room was the giant body without a head and the giant head without a body possibly related but she didn't have time for them either so she closed the door she took the third flight of stairs and as she opened the third door

The first thing she saw was old a sister's golden ball gripped in the hairy paw of a bogle. There was actually a whole gang of boggles. I'm presuming that you know about boggles like night creatures, hair sprouting out from their faces and their bodies, scaly tails dribbling and drooling pretty grim and they were playing nine pins and the pins were human bones and the ball was older sister's ball and the younger sister said excuse me but that ball does not belong to you you should give it back and the vocal said oh it does belong to us now actually because it rolled into our house yes but by accident said younger sister there was no way the older sister would let her ball deliberately go into a house like this, "Oh, you'd be surprised," said the Boggles.

"How many golden balls end up rolling into a house like this anyway? Well, not give it back unless you beat us." 
Younger sister looked at the human bones and she looked at the Boggles and she said,

"All right, I'll play you. And if I win, I get my sister's ball back."

And the Bogle said, "Yes, but if we win, We get yours."

The younger sister took out her ball from the pocket of her apron. She unfolded her handkerchief and it glowed gold in the gloom of the room. And then began the most vicious, the most competitive, the most ferocious game of nine pins that has ever been played in any story ever told.

The Boggles were just diabolical. They cheated all the time. They threw instead of rolled, but they had no control over the ball, whereas the younger sister, her aim was true and her ball was deadly, with every roll. She got new confidence with every point that she scored her eye sparkled and she just started beating them all the time. Game after game, leg after leg, match upon match. She was amazed at what her ball could do and she was so caught up in the pleasure of it that she didn't even notice that the night was over, that the dawn was breaking until the sunlight hit her in the face like a slab.

And suddenly she realised she'd actually beat the Boggles over a hundred times by now, she could have left hours ago and perhaps it was already too late. So she took both the golden balls, she ran out of the house and down that long road towards the town where older sister was already standing at the scaffold looking out at the massive crowd of people who'd come to see her hang.

There were so many of them, more than she could have ever imagined. People had brought their children. People had brought snacks. There were her parents right at the front with sandwiches. And as the hangman moved towards her older sister, said, "Please, please, wait." May I speak?"

And the crowd in front of her hushed. Mainly because a lot of them had placed bets on the contents of her last word so they were really invested. And older sister said, "I never lost my golden ball. I still know just where it lies, good people of this town. Even if I had, do you really think that for that I deserve to die?"

"Yeah!" roared the crowd and they jeered and they cheered and so older sister stood back and the hangman covered her face with a cloth and the hangman placed the noose around her neck and the next thing that older sister felt was her breath knocked from her body and the next thing that older sister saw was a bright light and a golden reflection of her own face in her own golden ball as a younger sister just in time leapt to the scaffold placed the ball in her hand wrapped her arms around her waist and ripped that cloth from off her face.

And older sister lifted her ball aloft for everyone to see and the younger sister did it too. The hangman begrudgingly removed the noose from around her neck and then the two sisters hand in hand, their balls blazing bright ran down the steps of the scaffold, passed their terrible parents, passed the jostling, booing crowd who were so upset that they weren't going to see her hanging out of the town and they hit the road. Looking for someplace else where themselves and their balls would not be subject to such savage laws.

The Three Golden Balls.

Told by a young woman, a native of Romsey, aged about 21.

There was once an old woman who lived with her husband and her three little daughters. One was named Pepper, one Salt, and one Mustard. One day their father told them he was going to the fair, and he asked them what he should bring them home, and they all said, "A golden ball each." Their father then wished them good-bye, and set off. In the evening he returned, and brought each of them a golden ball, which they got up early next morning to play with. Their mother told them that if they lost them she would hang them up on the gallows-tree. They were very happy playing, when little Pepper began to cry. Her isters asked her what was the matter, and she told them she had lost her ball. They dared not go home because of their mother. But, alas ! it got so late that they went home. Their mother, seeing that little Pepper was crying, asked what ailed her; and she said, "I have lost my ball." And the mother, in her anger, hung her up on the gallows-tree. Next day the father went to her, and she said —

"Oh, father, have you found my ball,  
Or have you paid my fee,  
Or have you come to take me down  
From this old gallows-tree?"

And he replied —

"I have not found your golden ball,  
Nor have I paid your fee,  
Nor have I come to take you down  
From this old gallows-tree."

Bye-and-bye her two sisters came to see her, and she said —

"Oh, sisters, have you found my ball,  
Or have you paid my fee,  
Or have you come to take me down  
From this old gallows-tree?"

And they made the very same answer as the father had given.

So poor little Pepper had to stop there all night. The next day brought her better luck. Her sweetheart came to see her, and she asked —

"Oh, Charlie! have you found my ball?" &&, &c.

and he replied —

"'Tis I have found your golden ball,  
And I have paid your fee,  
And I am come to take you down  
From this old gallows-tree."

Then her sweetheart cut her down, and they were changed into two little birds. Soon after her father came and heard two little voices up in the tree asking —

"Oh, father! have you found my ball," &c, &c

On hearing this, the father ran away very frightened ; and his wicked wife and two little daughters came against the tree, and heard the little voices say the same words. All of a sudden they heard a great rustling of leaves, and looking up, they saw the forms of little Pepper and her sweetheart flying to the ground. And they all went home, and lived a great many years.
