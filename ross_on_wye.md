The Cunning Man Again

To the Editor of the Ross Gazette.
 
Dear Sir,— When I was a boy I used to hear of certain apples called "Tewkesbury wheedles," but I never until a few days ago beard of Tewkesbury simpletons. Would it be believed that on Saturday morning last two young men called on me to inquire the way to Coleford, stating they bad that morning walked from Pendock, near Tewkesbury, through pouring rain, having been informed that near Coleford there lived a "cunning man," who could tell them who stole their tools? They were drainers, and had put several tools— shovel, pick, foot iron, &c.—at the door of a public-house while they had a pint of beer, during which time the tools were stolen. I told them my opinion of the foolishness of their expedition, when they determined to make the best of their way home again, when they would have walked about 40 miles on their fool's errand.

The Cunning Man of the Forest

TO DO

The Cunning Man of the Forest.—A short time since, three persons, residing a short distance from Blakeney, turned out a horse each to graze upon the unenclosed part of tho Forest, a privilege enjoyed by persons residing in tho neighbourhood. Finding but a short bite of grass, the animals strayed. On the owners missing them, a consultation took place, and was resolved to seek the assistance of the cunning man,” who resides at Viney Hill, near Blakeney, (and whoso exploits we have before noticed in our paper,) with tho view of obtaining possession of the truant steeds. A fee of Is. 6d. each soon set the man of stars plunging into tho mysteries of his craft; and after very portentous consultations with this and that planet, and the casting up of mysterious problems, tho sage, with the greatest solemnity, assured his confiding dupes that their horses had been stolen; that they had already passed through two market towns, and were then being driven into Iron Acton, and that men and women” were concerned in tho robbery. Thus enlightened, the horse-hunters, in high glee, left their "cunning” friend; and resolving to lose no time, at once crossed the Severn, and calling at a police station requested some of tho guardians of persons and property to accompany them in a chase after the thieves. The police, however, on ascertaining the source of their information, prudently deebned the invitation. Nothing daunted, tho intelligent trio, after few maledictions on the blue-coats, proceeded Acton, where "confirmation strong” the oracle of the Forest was soon forthcoming for lo! number of gipsics had been seen pass through the town with some horses ! Certain they were the men and women" who had possession of their horseflesh, the gallant hunters confided further chase to the police, telling them that they had since traced their lost horses, carefully avoiding, howoverall allusion to "cunning man" being their informer. The gipsies were traced by the police through Bristol, and some distance beyond, but no stolen horses could be found in their possession. The horse-hunters duly returned home, doubtless filled with admiration at the skill of the “ cunning man;" but alas for his infallibility, one of the animals had, in the interim, strayed back near to its original place, where it was found quietly browzing, and the others were subsequently found by the police, one at Broadslono, near Staunton, and the other at Monmouth. We understand this same “cunning man" is much consulted by the poorer classes of the locality, but probably his reputation will be somewhat damaged by this occurrence.

HEREFORDSHIRE SESSIONS. (Concluded from our last.) Tuesday, Oct. 16. Elizabeth Hudson pleaded guilty to the charge of breaking open a drawer in the house of her master Mr. Samuel Howells, of Leintwardine, and stealing a sovereign she was sentenced to fourteen days' solitary confinement The Chairman blamed the prosecutor for leaving a large sum of money (between 30 and sovereigns) in his drawer, instead of placing the cash in bank, and thus removing temptation from the servants. —[A fact evincing the grossest credulity and superstition, was connected with the above case. Some time before the trial was to come on, the mother of the prisoner posted off on a long journey into Shropshire for the purpose of consulting cunning man" as to the best means of getting her daughter over the difficulty. The fellow for sum of money supplied her with old silk sash, which he dignified with the name of a magic band," and stated that if the prisoner wore at the trial, she would be sure to be acquitted ! The band was conveyed to the solicitor for the defence, who wished to cut it up and ascertain the contents, but the mother declined the proposal with the utmost horror, observing that destruction would come upon them all if this were done, and took it away with her. Whether the sash was worn or not, did not transpire, but its magic virtues were not put to tbe test, for the girl, following the sensible advice of her counsel, pleaded guilty as above stated.] James Bason, found guilty upon two indictments, the first for stealing hat, and the second for stealing a pair of spurs, was sentenced to seven days' solitary confinement for tbe first offence, and seven years' transportation for the second.

Hereford Journal - Wednesday 29 May 1861

TO DO

SUPERSTITION IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY.—WITCHCRAFT. A woman named Builth, wife a mason residing in the parish of Walford, was summoned by Mary Whitaker, the same place, to show cause why she should not be bound over keep tbe peace. Mr. Williams appeared for defendant.—Complainant deposed : On the loth inst. she and her sister-in-law were going to a well for water ; defendant was in her court, and had child in her arms, when she remarked tbere comes old poison-cat;" this remark hurt the feelings complainant so much, that she went into a neighbour's houst and sat down ; when she came out again, defendant made the same remark, which caused complainant to go into fit, and remain for hours insensible ; complainant said the defendant was witch, and defendant had said she could make anybody walk their heads up a hill. Cross-examined : Did not call defendant a witch, nor accuse her of bewitching her pig ; believed defendant was a witch ; defendant had said she could use the black stick.—The Chairman enquired what that was Mr. Williams replied that it was the wand in which was the supposed magic power. The Chairman wished to know if Mr. Wiliiams had it in Court; tbat gentleman denied that his client was witch, saying that she was not in possession anything of the kind.—Complainant's examination continued : Her husband did not go into the Forest of Dean to consult a witch-finder, neither had she a charm round her neck ; admitted that she was not always amiable, and might have peppered the defendant little ; did not say that the wise man in the Forest would make defendant dance within a circle. Jane Hughes corroborated the foregoing evidence. She said the defendant was reputed witch ; had heard her say she could make people walk their heads ; she had told witness that she (the defendant) stuck her black stick in the garden, that witness could not enter it : she could bring all Kovvle Hill and Bull's Hill (places in tbe parish), to prove that defendant had said that she could bewitch people.—Cross-examined : Had never seen defendant fly through the air on a broomstick ; defendant was in the habit of wandering about the road at all hours of the night.—The Chairman said she had a perfect right to do so if she had liking for it, and wished to know if that was the reason she was looked upon witch Witness said defendant was very quarrelsome* and that nobody in the hill liked her.—Defendant denied the power imputed to her; she said her neighbours wished to make appear that she was witch, and were consequently afraid of her ; a great many persons were wearing trinkets they had got from the "cunning man in the Forest, to act as charms against her witchcraft ; she had lent complainant 15s. to buy pig, and because the pig would not eat, they said she had bewitched it, and went to the "cunning man " for him find out whether it was the cause or not ; the pig would not eat, therefore it was killed and eaten as pork. Mr. Williams, in addressing the Bench on behalf defendant, said that the information could not be sustained ; defendant had made no threats or used any bodily violence ; her making use of the poison-cat," was not sufficient upon which to call upon the defendant for sureties ; if complainant had any her mind, it arose from her own imagination that defendant had some supernatural power ; a number women were living in the same neighbourhood—they quarrel, and run for justice ; in short time they become reconciled, and live on friendly terms again ; he contended that there was case made out; it was case of defamation of character, and such a charge was be established as precedent, there would be no end such charges brought before their worships. Captain Power replied : In tbat case there would more clients for Mr. W. The witnesses had proved that defendant had commenced the quarrel. Mr. Williams said he should be able to prove that such was not the case ; and called the defendant's two daughters (two good-looking girls), saying those were the defendant's charms. Mr. Whatley thought they appeared like "Lancashir witches." The Bench length advised the parties to coinp ro mise the matter, by each paying their own costs. Mr. Williams asked tlie Bench to pronounce th*" defendant was not witch. The Chairman said, course, the Bench did not co»" sider that she was a witch ; and, addressing the parti*? 8 gave them some good advice, and recommended them *° live together as friends and neighbours should do. . Thus ended this strange tale of witchcraft, created much amusement to a crowded Court.

Morning Chronicle - Friday 31 May 1861

WITCHCRAFT AT Ross.— A woman named Builth, residing near Ross, has been charged before the magistrates with annoying another woman named Margaret Whitaker. The complainant had been called an "old poison cat," and a witch, and defendant had said she could make anybody walk on their heads up a hill. Jane Hughes deposed that t athe defendant was a repuited witch. Had heard her say that she could make poople walk on their heads. She had told witness that if she (the defendant) stuck her black stick in the garden, that witness could not enter it. She could bring all Kowle Hill `[Howle Hill?]` and Bull's Hill (places in the parish) to prove that defendant had said that she could bewitch people. Cross-examined: Had never seen defendant fly through the alr on a broomstick. Defendant was in the habit of wandering about the road at all hours of the night. Defendant denied the power imputed to her. She said her neighbours wished to make it appear that she was a witch, and were consequently afraid of her. A great many persons were wearing trinkets they had got from the "cunning man" in the Forest of Dean to act as charms againsther witchcraft. She had lent complainant 15s. to buy a pig, and because the pig would not eat, they said she had bewitched it, and went to the "cunning man" for him to find out whether it was the case or not. The pig would not eat, and therefore it was killed and eaten as pork. The solicitor for the complainant asked the Bench to pronounce that she was not a witch. The Chairman said of course the Bench did not consider that she was a witch, and the parties were then dismissed.

Riots in the Forest of Dean

"Monmouth, Friday Morning.

"There is at present a strong popular excitement in the Forest of Dean. A great portion of the Forest was enclosed and planted with oak, under an Act passed in 48th of George III., which plantations are now in a thriving state. The act provides that 11,000 acres are always to be kept inclosed as a nursery for timber: and that the nursery can only be legally opened by order of the Lords of the Treasury,  and that only when the young timber shall be safe for the browsing of the cattle sheep, and swine. An erroneous opinion, however, prevails among the foresters, that the inclosures should' be thrown open at the expiration of 21 years, and as the Act was passed in 1808 several of the enclosures are of a longer standing, and great dissatisfaction has been for some time felt at their continuance, and about a fortnight since a portion of the embankment was secretly destroyed. A large reward was offered for the discovery of the offenders, without effect, and hand bills were circulated, cautioning against the recurrence of similar outrages. On Wednesday morning a body of men, about eighty commenced levelling the embankments. In the course of the day their numbers increased to 500. On Thursday they continued the work of devastation, and their numbers increased to 2,000, parties being sent out in all directions to compel the colliers and other workmen to come and assist in opening the enclosures. Several miles of fences were levelled in these two days. The men worked regularly with suitable implements. Thev offered no injury to persons or private property, anil were particularly careful of the young timber. There was no military force in the neighbourhood beyond a body of about 50 men, consisting of the staff of the Monmouth Militia and a recruiting party. This small body marched towards the forest on Friday morning. There is no political feeling mixed up with the question of supposed local rights. There are reformers and anti reformers both amongst the foresters, and amongst those who were using their best endeavours to check their proceedings. The accounts from Merthyr continue favourable. The men have returned to their work. Mr. Crawshay's family have returned home—a strong indication of the restoration of order. The number killed, as gathered from the best information, is stated at seventeen or eighteen, including those who have died of their wounds."

Extract of a letter from Pontypool, Monmouthshire received in Shrewsbury yesterday by a tradesman, to whom are indebted tor the information it conveys:—

"Pontypool, Tuesday Morning, Two o'Clock.

"An old man has just come running in, sweating and breathless, to say that the rioters were at Nantyglo, nine miles from here. He had escaped from them. If they catch any that refuse to join them they cut off iheir ears. They are now two miles from here at Abersychan and much mischief is expected. They have threatened to pull down an iron master's house; and this town is all up in arms expecting the worst. It is said there are more than six thousand on their way here. The mob have taken several cannon, made a temporary battery, mounted tor regular siege; and built walls across the roads as high as a house. They are gathered from all quarters for a struggle."

There may be some little exaggeration, arising from personal fear, in the above letter. His Majesty's Ministers have given directions to the troops and soldiers in the vicinity, to march to the spot; and have no doubt the affair will soon be ended. What can misguided combinations of workmen expect, but misery, poverty, and death, as the result of combinations–*Shreswbury Chronocle.*

Gloucester Journal - Saturday 05 November 1842

HORRIBLE INFANTICIDES—SIX INFANTS MURDERED BY THEIR MOTHER.—We have this week the painful duty of recording a case of long continued and inhuman depravity almost unparalleled in the annals of crime. It appears that a woman named Frances Bennett, residing at Ruardean Hill, in the Forest of Dean, being very ill, and probably fearing to die with the undivulged guilt of murder upon her conscience, communicated to the Rev. Henry Formby, curate of Ruardean, that about twelve months since she became the mother of a child by a man named Thomas Yapp, with whom she has been for eight or ten years cohabiting, which child, after it had lived a few days she destroyed by poisoning it; after which she and Yapp buried it beneath the pavement of the brewhouse. The wretched woman further added that she had been the mother of five other children by the same man, all of whom she had murdered at their birth, and with Yapp’s assistance had buried their bodies at separate spots beneath the floor of the brewhouse and barn adjoining her cottage. These horrid confessions seemed, from their unexampled atrocity, to be more like the ravings of delirium than truth; but upon information being given to the police, and a search being made in the spots indicated by the unnatural woman, the skeletons of her six murdered offspring were all found, and stamped truth upon a tale too horrid else for belief. Upon this, Yapp was taken into custody, and a policeman, we believe, remained to take charge of the woman, who repeated her confession to her sister, and afterwards to the policeman Fowler. The circumstances being communicated to John Cooke, Esq. coroner, a warrant was issued for summoning a jury to hold an inquest. By this time, however, the woman Frances Bennett, had recovered in a measure the hardihood of her character, and on the inquest, which was held on Tuesday last, she positively denied that she had ever given birth to any children, except to two which she bore to her late husband, and which were alive now; and she, moreover, in the strongest manner, protested that she had never made any communication such as that above stated, either to her sister, to the policeman Fowler, or to the clergyman, the Rev. Mr. Formby. The latter gentleman was examined by the coroner, and deposed as above; and he further admitted that the woman had subsequently made further disclosures and confessions to him,* but as they were made to him in his spiritual capacity he must decline to divulge them!* And though the rev. gentleman had taken the usual oath before the coroner to "tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth," he nevertheless resisted in declining to give in evidence what the woman had stated to him. This conduct on the part of a Protestant clergyman of the Established Church, which is certainly somewhat singular, and we apprehend not quite recognised by the laws of the country, astonished both the coroner and the jury. We know that in the Roman Catholic priesthood the secrets of the confessional are held to be sacred, and very properly so, since the minister enters into a previous solemn engagement never to divulge them, and the communications are made in full faith in the inviolability of that engagement, and solely for a spiritual purpose, that of receiving absolution; but Protestant clergymen have no reservation of that kind to plead, and the whole truth with them must mean all that they know upon the particular subject. After, without effect, endeavouring to prevail upon Mr. Formby to state all that the woman had told him, and after the unavailing remonstrances against withholding of evidence, the coroner left the point as it stood, and passed on to the examination of the sister of Frances Bennett, whose evidence was to the effect that on Saturday last, the 29th October, she was with her sister, who had been in a weak state of health for some time and had been confined to her bed for about a week; that before Mr. Formby called, her sister made an alarm and exclaimed that she would have her dead children dug up and buried in the church-yard. She said that she delivered herself of the children over a pan of water, and that immediately the infants were born she held them under the water till they were dead, and that then she and Yapp buried them. She added that the last of the six children was not served in this way, but lived for two days; that it was weakly and she gave it some arsenic and it died; that Yapp was very sorry when he found this child was dead, and said he would not have lost it for fifty pounds; and that they both together buried the child in the brewhouse.—At this stage of the proceedings it was thought advisable to adjourn the inquiry, in order to afford opportunity for further and more deliberate inquiry into the circumstances of this mysterious and very extraordinary case; and the inquest was accordingly adjourned till Wednesday next.

One of the strange features in this case is that the sister, who resides next door to Frances Bennett, states that she never suspected the latter to be in the family way; nor does it appear that any of the other female neighbours ever expressed any suspicions of the kind. And thus for about the last eight years, according to her own statement, had this unnatural and monstrous woman been almost yearly in the constant practice of giving birth to and murdering a child without incurring any suspicion; and it was only from the compunctions of her own overladen guilty conscience, in what she no doubt supposed to be the dread hour of death, that the horrid tragedy above narrated was disclosed to the world.

This woman, Frances Bennett, we understand, is the widow of a man named Bennett, who at his death left her his property, but with the absurd, and in this case mischievous proviso, that if ever she married again the property should pass from her. This stipulation probably was the cause of her cohabiting with Yapp, instead of being married to him, and may also have been the remote inducement which led to the multiplied murders of which she acknowledged herself to have been guilty. From our inquiries, we gather that poverty could not have been the motive to such unnatural conduct, as she and Yapp were, for persons in a labouring class, in easy circumstances, Their cottage is well furnished, and has every appearance of comfort. The occurrence, we need hardly say, has created a great sensation in the neighbourhood, and various rumours are afloat.

Further disclosures in this most foul and most unnatural case are looked for with much anxiety; and it is hoped that the scruples which the Rev. Mr. Formby felt as to giving his evidence will, at the next assembling of the jury be removed, more especially, as we believe there can be no doubt that by a continued refusal to give legitimate evidence, he may render himself amenable to unpleasant consequences. With regard to the wretched woman herself, who has been the author of this frightful tragedy, we understand she appears to be between forty and fifty years of age, and that her illness is of a very serious character, so much so as to lead to the opinion that she will not recover.

FOREST OF DEAN. The Extraordinary Charge of Child-Murder in the Forest of Dean.— The adjourned inquiry into the mysterious and horrible cases of wholesale child-murder Kuardeaii, In the Forest of Dean, the particulars of which published last week, was resumed on Wednesday last, before John Cooke, Esq. coroner, and in the presence of several of the magistrates of the district. The evidence adduced was similar to that to which we adverted last week, and no new fact of a material nature transpired. The jury expressed an opinion that if further time were allowed, additional evidence might probably be obtained, and the inquest was consequently again adjourned till Wednesday next, the 16th inst. In the meantime, Thomas Yapp continues in custody, and a policeman also remains in the house where the tragedy was committed, in order to take charge the woman, Frances Bennett, who continues in the same state of ill-health which we reported last week. [The *Times* of Thursday devotes an article to the discussion of the question, of how far the clergyman to whom the woman under the tortures of troubled conscience made certain horrid disclosures, is bound to communicate what she told him. The *Times* arrives at the conclusion that he is not called upon to disclose what was communicated him under such circumstances. We will refer to the arguments in our next]

THE CHILD MURDERS IN THE FOREST OF DEAN. The inquiry into the unparalleled case of the alleged murder of six infants successively by their mother, at Ruardeanhill, in the Forest of Dean, terminated on Wednesday last, before John Cooke, Esq., coroner. Several magistrates of the district attended the inquest. Four or five additional witnesses were examined on Wednesday, but with the exception of one, their evidence was not materially important for the ends of justice, inasmuch as there were already abundant facts and circumstances making a too clear case against the wretched woman, Frances Bennett; and the only part of the case which, in a legal point of view, was at all defective was, the question how far the evidence made out the criminality of the man, Thomas Yapp, it being a rule of law that the confession of a criminal is not good against an accomplice except it be corroborated by other testimony. In this instance there is, of course, circumstantial corroboration in the facts of Thomas Yapp living with the woman for the last ten or twelve years, the period during which this long list of murders was perpetrated; as also the finding of the skeletons of the numerous murdered infants in the unhallowed graves where the unnatural mother states that she, with Yapp's assistance, deposited them. On Wednesday last, we understand, another link, connecting him in some degree with the female prisoner, and with a knowledge of her situation at the time when she gave birth to the last of her victims, was supplied under rather singular circumstances. It seems that about last Christmas a person named Watkins, who was known to Yapp, was in the neighbourhood of Ruardean; that Yapp invited him to remain and sleep at the house occupied by him and the female prisoner; that Watkins accepted the invitation, and occupied during the night the same bed as Thomas Yapp, while the female prisoner, Frances Bennett, slept by herself in an adjoining room; that about twelve o'clock at night and from that time till between two and three, the witness heard a suppressed moaning, as of a person in pain, in Frances Bennett's room; that this noise kept him awake for a long time, but at last he dropped off to sleep, and heard nothing more till about five o'clock, when Thomas Yapp got up and went down stairs to get a light, and appeared to be searching for matches, which he said he could not find; that he then returned up stairs and went into Frances Bennett's room, but how long he remained there this witness could not tell, as he again fell asleep and heard no more. This witness, it appears, on Saturday last, again came to Ruardean, and saw the prisoner Frances Bennett, who, in conversation, asked him if he remembered sleeping there last Christmas? He replied that he did; upon which she added, "I deceived you all nicely that night; for that was the very time when my last child was born." The jury, after maturely considering the evidence, returned a verdict of " Wilful murder" against the mother Frances Bennett, as principal, and against Thomas Yapp as accessary; and the coroner issued his warrant for the committal of both prisoners to the county gaol, to take their trial at the next assizes. In pursuance of this warrant, Thomas Yapp, on Thursday morning, and Frances Bennett, in the evening, were brought in custody to this city, and received into the county gaol. Yapp, who has latterly followed the business of an hallier, is about thirty-four years of age, and has the appearance of an illiterate and sullen man. The woman is apparently at least ten years older, and continues in a very weak state ot health, her illness being supposed to be of a consumptive nature; but a surgeon's certificate was given that she was capable of being removed, and there are reports in the neighbourhood that her present indisposition arises from her being again in a situation likely to become a mother. The discovery of these extraordinary and horrible occurrences has created a great sensation in the secluded district of Ruardean.—*Gloucestershite Chronicle.*

Warwick and Warwickshire Advertiser - Saturday 03 December 1842
THE MURDERS AT RUARDEAN. Gloucester, Saturday.— Few occurrences have excited a more painful interest in this quarter than the investigation which terminated in the committal of Frances Bennett from Ruardean, in the Forest of Dean, to the County Gaol in this city, to await her trial at the assizes. The circumstances have been stated, and are shortly these:—Frances Bennett, after the death of her husband, by whom she had several children, lived with man named Yapp, a hauler, the children by marriage having gone to live elsewhere. About a month ago Bennett, under the apprehension that she was about to die, made a disclosure to a clergyman, in the presence of several persons, to the effect that she had had six children by Yapp, but none of them had been allowed to live, she having suffocated them immediately after birth. She told where the remains of the bodies would be found. The latest murder, according to the confession of the woman, was perpetrated about Christmas last year, and the spot which she indicated as containing the remains was found on examination to conceal the most perfect skeleton of any. The truth of this horrid confession having in this way been placed beyond a doubt, information was sent to John Cooke, Esq., one of the County Coroners, who instantly proceeded from Gloucester to Ruardean to institute an investigation. The witnesses examined on the inquest consisted chiefly of persons to whom the woman had made the confession, including the clergyman who had communicated with the Magistrate on the subject, and the person who had found the remains of the bodies. In the course of the examination of the clergyman by the Coroner, it came out that he had had a second interview with the wretched woman, none being present but themselves, and that she had made some additional disclosures. The rev. gentleman, however, on the ground that what he was told upon this occasion was mixed up with his "spiritual" duties, refused to communicate any particulars, although pressed to so by the Coroner. The woman, moreover, began to deny that she had made any such confession as that sworn to by the witnesses; but enough had been proved to justify the Jury in returning a verdict of wilful murder against Bennett and her paramour Yapp. The latter was instantly removed to Gloucester, but the state of Bennett's health was such as to induce the Coroner to delay the order for her removal till it could be effected without danger.

On the afternoon of Thursday, the 17th instant, the miserable woman arrived as the county gaol in a fly, attended by Mr. Bird, a medical man. She was carried up stairs to the hospital, and on being placed on the bed, said, "Now I will die happy." She died early on Friday morning. This day (Saturday) an inquest was held on the body, before John Cooke, Esq., the Coroner, who conducted the investigation at Ruardean. Disease had reduced the body to a perfect skeleton, but the appearance of the features was more pleasing than otherwise. Mr. Cooke, who saw the deceased alive about three weeks ago, remarked that her face had undergone little change.

The first witness examined was Elisa Gansmore, one of the nurses attached to tbe gaol, who stated that she was directed to wait upon deceased shortly after her arrival. Deceased often thanked God that she had been removed, and said that she was much happier in gaol than at home.

The Coroner here stated that a rumour was abroad that the deceased was in the family way, and asked the witness if she could speak to the point?—The witness stated that she asked the question of deceased, and she stated that she was not. Deceased said that she was only 38 years of age.

Maria Nuttal, another nurse, was next examined. She said that she was present when the deceased died on Friday morning, and was with her for some days previous. She asked witness to read and pray to her. Sometimes when she was reading the deceased would say, "Stop; wait till I'm better," and when she recovered she would ask her to go on. As her death approached she seemed to feel contented. She was sensible to the last. She said that she had been ill for about twelve months.

Mr. Hickes, tbe surgeon, stated that the complaint of which the deceased died was pulmonary consumption, and, in his opinion, the removal from Ruardean had neither injured nor benefited her. She seemed to be aware that she could survive only for a few days. She mentioned to him and to others that she had been sent to gaol charged with the murder of her children.

The Jury returned a verdict of "Died from natural causes."

Yapp, on being told of the death of Bennett, wept bitterly. The body was buried the relatives of the deceased.

As to worldly means, the murderers were comfortable. Indeed it is alleged that the only index to their brutal conduct is be found in the circumstauce that Bennett's husband settled his property upon her, but with the restriction that should she marry again the property was to go to his children. It was the desire to retain the property which probably prevented her marriage with Yapp, and every body knows how one crime leads to another.

Gloucester Assizes.— ... In the case of Yapp, the paramour of Frances Bennett, the woman who, under the tortures of a guilty conscience, confessed that she had murdered six of their infants, it was expected that moch of the "horrible" would have been developed. The death, however, of the woman had changed the aspect of the case as regarded the accessory, and the able lawyer who was entrusted with the prosecution resolved to abandon the case. The prisoner was consequently discharged.

FOREST OF DEAN

TO DO

The Iron Mines of the Forest of Dean.— Some of the primitive Iron mines In the Forest are great curiosities, although they easily escape the attention of strangers, from their secluded situation, and the obscurity of their entrances. small aperture, not unlike a fbx-eaiib, amongst projecting masses of limestone rock, admits the miner the scene his labours. descends partly wooden pegs driven into the soil, and the help of short ladder which carries with him, and thus arrives in the subterranean labyrinth from which he excavates the ore. These mines are worked labouring men, who ara “free minors** under the old forest laws, asdsted bv their families; and the ore is carried to the surface young bovs, in packages called •’billies,” which are secured the Imck, and thus secured they crawl hands, knees, and feet from the recesses the mine, till they climb into day-light. The hands ami knees of these j>uor boys are frequently hoofed ; the skin being converted into a boiry texture continual pressure. The iron ore, lying in ’ pockets' or churns,” as they are called the miners, ribbed in the limestone rock, loaves irregular passages and caverns lu all directions, after it has been dug out, that the Interior presents the most grotesque combinations pillars, cells, grottoes, lofty domes, and narrow low corridors of variously coloured limestone, the effect of which, under the purl i«l illumination of the miners’ candles, is often very imposing. This class * * y periinl alteration. In consequence of the application of capital to improved methods of mining on larger scale. The scene which the wrritcr wishes describe, is tlwj site of probably the most ancient mine-w-orks the kingdom, and not visited so frequently as it desetves to be. lies near the village of Dream, on the left of the turnpike road leading from kydnevto Coleford, and known the provincial appellation £e •Stmules,” a name commonly ai»pltod to old mine-works, and probably derived, as suggested a learned Forest Commissioner, from the British Ceatc/, signifying a cavern or excavation. the recesses of wood, near some of the primitive mines, you suddenly enter upon what at first sight appears to be an extensive and confused min, in deep dell, overgrown with ivy and lichen, and interspersed with lofty trees. These are. reality, the limestone rock left its natural formations after the iron ore had been carried away by the old British and Homan miners, who appear to have pursued course of mining downwards from the surface, clearing out the superficial “churns,” a<» far they extended in every direction, and thus leaving cavities and elevations which a long course of years lias given their present romantic appearance, obliterating all traces of the process, and clothing every hollow with vegetation. Tall and spreading tree* flourish on the very summits of some of the natural columns that rear their lofty forms amidst this wild scene ; others extend their branches over clustering rocks covered with raos? and creeping plant*, whilst devious paths, winding their way amongst these relics of nature exposed art, invite the visitor’s tarriance. whilst he Indulges the musing mood which such spot is calculated to inspire. But the most singular portion of these antique scowdes grotesque mas.? rocks, called the •' Devil’s Chapel," In which Is pulnit vast dimensions, appropriated the country people the infernal oratory of Satan w hen he officiates on solemn occasions amongst his congregations of demons and witches there a*sembled. In truth it is a scene well adopted to superstitious imaginings, and those old tales of witchcraft and diablerie, in which the arch-demon and his earthly colleagues celebrate their nocturnal orgies. A cloudy midnight such place, with glimpses of moonshine just revealing its ragged horrors, and profound shades—a fitful night-wind, and flapping boughs, with now and then the cry of an ill-omened bird, startling the ear, would make susceptible imagination run wild, peopling the solitude with its unutterable visions.

Wizardry on the Welsh Border. Beatrix A. Wherry, pp75-87

Wizardry on the Welsh Border.

(Read at Meetings 17th February, 1904)

[The following article, by a young lady who is still at school, is inserted in all its fulness of picturesque detail partly on account of the admirable object lesson it affords in the collection of folklore. Boys and girls have a great advantage in this work in the ease with which they can vanquish the barriers of racial or class prejudice, which are after all the main difficulties to be overcome. Miss Wherry has given fictitious names to her informants, but the genuineness of her narratives must be self-evident to any one who knows the garrulous dramatic visionary folk of the Welsh Marches. Readers will not fail also to note the close correspondence of the relative positions of witch and wise man in Monmouthshire with those of the witch and witch-doctor in Central Africa, as described in the preceding paper. — Ed.]

While staying at a farmhouse in Monmouthshire this summer, I tried to collect some stories about the wise men, ghosts, and superstitions of the place. I was indebted to our landlady, Mrs. Briton, for many of them, but she referred me to an old Mrs. Pryce, who, she said, could tell me more stories than anyone.

I first made the acquaintance of Mrs. Pryce in the stable-yard wishing to sell a "fine oak table." She was a weird-looking figure in her heavy cloak and cottage bonnet, but the most striking feature about her was the curious penetrating brightness of her eyes. Next day we all trooped down to see the table in her cottage at Trelleck. She was more witch-like than ever; so much so that I looked around for the black cat, which, however, was not forthcoming; she gave long histories of the usual six children whom she had buried, also of her quarrels with her landlord. She also wished to sell some chairs, for she said, "I've no need of chairs, being all alone, and I have the bench I used to kill pigs upon, 'twill not be used for that agen, so I may so well sit on it so long as I do live."

Two or three days afterwards she came up for the money for her table. Drawing me mysteriously out of the room she whispered on the stairs, "They're after me for the rent." She got her money and was then prevailed upon to "take a drop o' cider." I then took the opportunity of asking her if she knew anything about Jenkyns, the wise man, in whom I was very much interested, having heard a great deal about him.

"Lor' bless you, me dear," said she, " Why, Jenkyns 'as been a comfort to me all me life. If I ever 'ad a pain of any sort, rheumaticks, toothache, or what ye like, if I'd go to Jenkyns 'e'd always take it away. Anything that were lost, in all the country-side, 'e'd always find it. 'Deed I did miss old Jenkyns when 'e died, and and many's the time I've wished 'im back agen."

I asked her what old Jenkyns' appearance was, and gathered that he was an oldish man, with a long dark beard; stooping, and walking with a stick. "He allus wore one o' those box 'ats," said Mrs. Pryce, " an' an old round coat about the house, but when 'e went to town 'e put on a long coat with tails,"

"But have you ever seen any of his charming, Mrs. Pryce?"

"Lor' bless you, yes, me dear," said she; "many an' many a time, but onst in particular I were dreadful skeered, an' I'll tell you all about it. One day one of me brothers had a toothache, so him an' me an' me other brother went up to old Jenkyns to have it charmed away. Jenkyns could charm away anything; many a time, when I've had rheumaticks or pain of any sort I'd go to Jenkyns an' say, 'Oh! Jenkyns, I do feel so bad, take away my pain, do now;' 'an' 'e'd say,' 'Well now, d'ye believe?' 'Oh, yes, I believe,' say I, an' there! the pain 'ud be gone.

"Well, as I was sayin', when the toothache was gone, Jenkyns went out o' the kitchen to fetch a drop o' cider, an' me brother see'd a big, big book on the comer of the table, an' began to look at it. Jenkyns hollers out from the other side of the house, 'Don't you touch that book, or it'll be the worse for you!' When 'e came back me brother says, 'You must have got the Old Man 'imself about 'ere to have such like goings on,' says 'e. Just then there came a great noise in the room above, bowling about the floor, like as if a great big ball were rollin' about 'All right,' says Jenkyns, 'if you don't look out, youll have him a bit closer.'

"With that 'e takes a candle an' blows into it, puts it on the table, an' draws a circle round it. Then the light all burnt dim an' blue, and the whole room got cloudy an' misty. Presently, we see'd a little old man sittin' in a chair next to Jenkyns, 'e was rockin' 'imself to and fro, and squeakin', 'Jenky, Jenky, Jenky!' an' again, 'Jenky, Jenky, Jenky!' Now 'e 'adn't come thro' the door, 'cos that was locked; an' 'e 'adn't come thro' the window, 'cos that was shut an' barred; an' yet there e' was, sittin' in the chair, calling 'Jenky, Jenky, Jenky!' an' 'Jenky, Jenky, Jenky!' Then Jenkyns blew into the candle agen, an' the dim blue light went away, an' the candle burned clear, an' lo an' behold! that little grey old man was vanished.

"'There!' says Jenkyns; but me brothers didn't wait to hear any more; they just took to their heels an' set off home as if the Old Man were after them, leavin' me to follow as best I could. But I believe to this day 'twas the Old Gentleman himself as we saw."

I asked her what had become of the big book, and what was in it, but she did not know, though she thought that the books were left to a nephew who had disappeared. She did not know the contents of them either, but said that "the Bible was a great book with him!" I had no time to ask any more questions, for Mrs. Pryce was launched on another story.

"One day there was a young man goin' to Monmouth races, an' as 'e was passin' 'is field, 'e see'd the cattle 'atin' of 'is crops. So 'e up an' took 'is jacket off an' throwed it over the gate, an druv' 'em off; but when 'e come back 'is jacket was gone. Now there was an 'ooman round there as 'e knowed 'ud take anything, but o' course 'e 'oodn't miss the Monmouth races, an' so 'e went without 'is jacket. But when 'e came back 'e told 'is wife, an' she told 'im to go off to old Jenkyns an' 'e'd get it back for 'im. Well, old Jenkyns 'e said, 'That 'ooman wont rest till she come an' put your coat back on the gate where she took'd it from. But what'll I do to punish 'er?'

"'Oh!' said the young man, 'don't do anything to hurt her, so long as I gets me jacket back.'

"'Well,' says the old Jenkyns, ' 'ow 'ud it be if I was to put the button 'ole on her cheek, just 'ere, under 'er eye?'

"'All right,' says the young man.

"An', sure enough, that 'ooman come'd n' put back that jacket on the gate, where she tooked it from; but ever arterwards she 'ad the mark of a black button-hole on 'er cheek, just beside 'er eye, so as everyone should know what sort of an 'ooman she was."

"But have you seen the mark, Mrs. Pryce?" I said.

"Why yes, me dear," said Mrs, Pryce, " t'was old So-and-so;" and with that she gave me her whole pedigree. "An' many a time have I seen that mark," said she. "Oh, Jenkyns always punished people when they stole things; there was those folk down to Pen-y-van, they had a bad time of it, I'll tell you about that. There was a farmer down by Pen-y-van, an' 'e 'ad a lot o' cider, but that all got stolen by four people. So 'e went to old Jenkyns to see what was to be done. But ole Jenkyns, 'Tisn't no good,' says he, 'the cider's drinked; I can't get it back for you, 'cos it's all drinked; but I'll tell you what I'll do,' says 'e; 'you come along to the green at six o'clock to-morrer evening, an' I'll make 'em dance;' an' sure enough he coom'd, an' there was these four people dancin' away on the green, men an' women. An' they couldn't help it, 'cos old Jenkyns 'ad put a spell on them, an' they danced for two hours for punishment, till 'e tooked the spell off. An' there was hundreds o' people watchin' 'em. Old Ann Griffiths, she told me all about it, how they was dancin' and jumpin' about, an' all the time ready to drop. Old Jenkyns, 'e was a watchin' quite pleased like for some time; then 'e got tired, tooked the spell off an' went home."

"An' it's not the first time 'e's punished people like that," said Mrs. Briton. "Don't you remember that 'ooman at the public down to Grosmont?" and she started on her story, Mrs. Pryce now and then putting in a nod of approval

"One day old Jenk3ms was going down town, an' 'e stopped at a public, 'The Cock and Feather,' to get some refreshment 'E asked for bread an' cheese an' beer; when 'e'd finished 'e asked 'ow much it was. 'Oh,' says the landlady, 'lef s see, six an' four's ten, that's tenpence, please.' Jenkyns said, 'twas too much, but 'e paid 'is tenpence an' went off.

"Presently the 'ooman came back into the room an' went up to the place where Jenkyns had been sitting, an' calls out,

"Six an' four's ten.  
Here's off agen.'

"An' she started runnin' round the table, an' when she came back to Jenkyns' place she called out again,

"'Six an' four's ten.  
Here's off agan.'

"An' started ninnin' round agen. Presently 'er daughter came in an' seed 'er mother runnin' round the table an' callin' out, so she knowed she'd got a spell on 'er. She went on like that for an hour and a half, then 'er son came back from work an' see'd 'is mother runnin' round the table, callin' out,

"Six an' four's ten.  
Here's off agen.'

"So 'e said, "Why, mother, what's t' matter?'"

An' she says, 'Oh, I don't know!

"'Six an' four's ten,  
Here's off" agen.'

"So 'e said to 'is sister, ''As so-an'-so been 'ere?' an' she said 'e 'ad, an' 'e said, ''Ow long's 'e been gone?' an' she said, 'Two hour.'

"So 'e went an' caught up old Jenkyns an' tells 'im what was wrong, an' Jenkyns says, 'Serve 'er right for chaigin' a poor man tenpence for a bit o' bread an' cheese. But,' 'e says, 'you go an' look under a candlestick on your mantelpiece; there youll see a bit of paper. Don't you look at it or it'll be the worse for you, but throw it in the fire. An' I hope this'll be a lesson to yer mother.'

"So the son went home, an' there was 'is mother, still runnin' round an' calling out,

"Six an' four's ten,  
Here's off" agen.'

"'E ran to the chimney-piece, there was the paper! an' 'e throwed it in the fire; 'is mother dropped into a chair, all exhausted like. An' it served 'er right."

Mrs. Briton stopped, quite exhausted, for she had been acting the story herself all the time, rushing round the table and shouting,

"Six an' four's ten,  
Here's off agen."

Mrs. Pryce and I were simply screaming with laughter, and it was some time before Mrs. Pryce went on, with a rather disjointed story about a witch:

"One day some folk came to old Jenkyns about a witch; they told 'im 'ow she used to turn herself into a hare an' stand on an old gate-post an' frighten folk terrible. Once there was some men goin' by an' they see'd 'er on the post, an' she called out

"Pee wow, pee wow!' and jumped down; an' they all runned away. So old Jenkyns he says, *You follow after her,' says 'e, 'an' stick a knife into 'er *third 'eel-mark*, then you'll be rid of her.' Now this old witch had put a spell on a woman in the village, so 'er husband an' 'er brother said they'd pay 'er out.

"They see'd the old lady goin' along the road one day, an' so in the third heel-mark from where she was they stuck a knife into the ground. She set up such a screechin' you could a' heard it for miles. 'Oo told you to do that' says she, an' begins sayin' things most awful. Then she went off limpin' like, as if a knife was put right thro' 'er foot So you see old Jenkyns 'e knew 'ow to settle witches, 'e did. Twas a pity he never see'd them on the Buckle. I'll tell you about them.

"One day there was a man going down the Buckle pitch, an' as 'e was goin' along, all of a sudden 'e 'eard sumthin' a comin' down behind 'im, an' 'e looked an' there 'e saw an old 'ooman a comin' gallopin' down the pitch on a piece of an old hurdle. She come right past 'im, an' 'e tried to catch hold of the hurdle; but no, 'e couldn't touch it, nohow. Then there came along another old hag, leppin' an' gallopin' on a ladder, an' behind her came another, as I'm alive, trundlin' on a common grindstone! They came right past 'im, an' on to a public beyond the pitch, an' there they stopped, an' them that wasn't too frightened tried to shoot 'em, but no, nothing couldn't touch 'em, nobody could catch hold of that hurdle, nor the ladder, nor the grindstone neither; an' presently they called, 'Pee wow. Pee wow!' 'an' was off again, so as nobody couldn't stop 'em."

"Well, now I'd like to have seen that," said Mrs. Briton. "I expect you'll be practising on one o' them old grindstones, won't you, to see if you can get along same as the witches? "

"Talkin' of witches," said Mrs. Pryce, "there was a wise woman way over the mountains some time ago, as I heard tell of. She could find anything that were lost. One day there was a man that had a very fine watch, an' 'e put it on the table one day while 'e went to clean 'isself, an' when 'e come back 'twas gone. So 'is mother went off 'way over the mountains to this old 'ooman. Jes' as she came up to the door a little dog run out barking. Then there came out a little, little old 'ooman. 'Don't you be afraid o' the dog,' says she; 'I know what you's come about. Twas your own niece as took the watch. You go back 'ome an' look under the stone next the pump in your scullery, an' there youll find it,' says she. 'An' will you have 'er that took it punished?' said she. But the 'ooman thanked her, and said so long as she got the watch back, she didn't care to punish any one, much less her own niece. So she went back, an' there sure 'nough she found the watch under a stone in the scullery. Now, weren't that strange, as the old 'ooman who'd never seen the place should know where the thing was?"

This was the last story Mrs. Pryce told me. Mrs. Briton, however, remembered some more about Jenkyns, and one day, when I was mangling for her, she told me the following:

"One day old Jenkyns was comin' up from Monmouth, and just on the pitch by the station was four horses strugglin' an' strainin' to drag a great piece of timber up the hill. They were pullin' an' men were pushin', an' then they'd be pulled back by the weight of it Jenkyns, he looked at them for some time, then he up an' shouts, 'Unhitch that fore horse!' So they unhitched him, 'cos nobody dared disobey anything that Jenkyns told them to do. 'Now hitch 'im on behind,' 'e said ; an' so they hitched 'im on behind. Then Jenkyns tooked the whip, cracked it, an' shouted, ' Now, me lads, all together!' An' would you believe it, them 'orses that couldn't move a step before, galloped up the hill like a top spinnin', an' the leader dancin' behind!"

Another day I cornered Mrs. Briton in the dairy, and bargained for a story. " Well," she said, " I'll tell you what I know 'bout old Sarah Griffiths. They used to say she was a witch, an' this was told me by old Jacob Jones 'isself, an' 'e ought to know. So if it's a lie, it's 'is own lie.

"It 'appened when Mr. Mason was livin' at the Argoed. 'Is gardener was very particler 'bout havin' turf from the 'ill, an' they 'ad ter bring it across the river in boats, an' old Tom Griffiths an' Jacob Jones, they was 'elpin'. Well, on the last day, when they'd got it all up, Mr. Mason's gardener, 'e left some money down at the Boat Inn, so as they should 'ave some beer, 'cause 'e was pleased they'd brought the turf up so quick. So Tom, when 'e went up to tea, 'e says to Sarah, 'e was goin' down for an hour, cos they was goin' to 'ave some singin' down at the 'Boat'; but Sarah, she said, 'Thee shassent go down theer; thee'st better stay at 'ome 'an 'ave thee's supper.'

"Well, Tom, 'e would'nt sUy, so she said, 'If thee goes down theer, thee bis'nt comin' 'ome to-night' An' she began to curse an' swear, an' say she wished the devil 'ud run off with 'im if 'e went down, but still 'e went.

"Well, 'e was a comin' up again, about ten, with old Jacob Jones, an' Jacob was a little way in front; 'e was a tellin' me about it arterwards. 'E said, 'It's as true as my hand's there,' 'e said, 'I felt myself goin' up, up, an' it took me breath away, it was so swift, an' I went up right over the hedge.' It were one of those 'igh 'edges all over dog-briars an' blackberry branches. An' 'e went right over, sheer down into the meadow the other side. Presently 'e 'eard some 'un swearin' close by, an' 'e said, 'Tom, is that thee ? What f devil art doin' theer? 'An' Tom said, 'Jacob is that thee? What t' devil art doin' heer?'

"An' then they tried to get out, but they couldn't, an' they was all scrat about, an' bruised, an' cut, an' try as they might they couldn't get out, they was so buried in briars an' brambles. They lay there swearin' an' talkin' to one another till half-past five in the mornin', when they 'eard Dan an' Tom, their two boys, comin' up home from the dnworks. Then Jacob 'e called out 'Lor' bless thee, Dan, is that thee? Coom an' get us out o' this!'

"An' them two boys 'ad the greatest difficulty in gettin' 'em out, they was so stuck in them briars an' things. But at last they got out, an' when they got 'ome, there was old Sally boilin' the kettle, an' she said, 'I telled thee, Tom, thee oosn't come 'ome, an' thee didn't'

"There's another story I've just remembered about a witch," said Mrs. Briton; "I'll just tell you about it.

"There was an old witch used to live 'bout here, an' she had a daughter. Now there was a young man very fond of this girl, and wanting to marry her, but her mother hated him, and would have liked to have put him out of the way if she could.

"One day he came up to see his sweetheart, and there was her mother a brewin' somethin' in a saucepan on the fire. She says, 'Tom, do 'ee take t' kettle an' bring me some water from the well.' But the girl called out, 'Don't 'ee go, Tom. Oh! don't 'ee go.' 'You be quiet, ye interfering hussy,' says the old 'ooman. 'Here, Tom, take t' kettle.'

"So Tom took the kettle an' went off to the well, an' dipped it in; but 'e felt somethin' a pullin' an' pushin' him till it got 'is 'ead right under water as 'twere tryin' to drown him. O' course 'e struggled and kicked till 'e got 'is 'ead up again, an' then 'e looked round to see who 'twere, but there — there war'nt no one.

"'E couldn't see no one, but in two minutes somethin' had 'im again and got 'im under the water, an' all this time 'e couldn't get the kettle filled anyway. Three times 'e were took an' dipped in the well, an' it were a wonder 'e weren't drowned, for 'twas all 'e could do to keep 'is 'ead up. At last 'e got the kettle filled an' went back to the cottage.

"There was the old 'ooman still brewin' in the saucepan an' mutterin' to herself; but when she saw 'im that she thought was drowned come to the door with the kettle full she stopped all of a sudden an' looked at 'im that awful, an' a sort of a horrid laugh came out of the saucepan, an' the lid jumped off an' flew right up the chimney so as all the kitchen was filled with smoke an' the most awful smell. Then 'e knowed she 'ad been brewin' spells to kill 'im, so 'e dropped the kettle an' took to 'is 'eels, an' all up the road 'e could 'ear 'er cursin' 'im, an' I take it 'e was glad to get 'ome. But 'e never went after that girl agen."

Mrs. Briton is one of the few people from whom you can get ghost stories first hand; they are rather vague, but she believes in them implicitly.

"One day," she said, "our cattle got lost an' our two boys went out to look for them. They was out for hours an' hours, an' towards evening Bill Roberts brought the cattle home, but 'e 'adn't seen them boys. So I began to get anxious like, an' I went out all over the place huntin' an' callin' for them. At last it got quite dark, an' I was in an awful state o' mind: I put a lamp in the window to guide them if they was to come back, an' went out with my father to look for them again. We was just goin' past the house of a wicked, wicked old man what had just died (they told all kinds of stories about him, some said as 'e had killed 'is own wife); as I was sayin' we was passin' this house, an' I saw just beside me a big, big, black dog, as large as a calf, an' 'is eyes shone like lumps of fire. My father hit at it with 'is stick, an', would you believe me, the stick went right through it, an' 'twas still there!

"Bye-an'-bye, when we'd passed the house, the dog disappeared.

"'That's a sure token,' says my father, 'that them boys is in the river!'

"Well, you may believe that made me feel bad, but when we got 'ome the lamp was gone out of the window, an' I rushed upstairs, there was the boys fast asleep. Next momin' they told me how they'd got so tired an' gone to sleep in the road, an' woken up when it was dark an' come on home. But that day a telegram come to say as my brother 'ad been killed by a railway truck. So, you see, it was an omen, seeing that there dog."

There is a funny old house on the way to Penallt called the "Potash"; it is said to be haunted, but Mrs. Briton is the only person I have met who has seen anything there. This is her account:

"One night about twelve o'clock I was goin' along the road down to Mitchel Troy, where we used to live; I was just nearin' the 'Potash' when I heard like a lot of people talkin' in the air. First I thought 'twas the gypsies, but as I was comin' by the hedge in the field I saw a sort of a black cloud comin' thro' the gap, an' I heard a sound of dankin' chains, but all at once I knowed it wasn't gypsies 'cos they weren't there, an' I heard voices all around. I ran, an' ran, I was so frightened, till at last I fell right into a sand pit at the bottom of the hill."

Some other members of Mrs. Briton's family have seen visions too. Her son, Samuel, told me that one night, goin' up through Troy Woods, he had seen a great black beast with flaming eyes, and when he turned his lantern on it, it vanished with a sort of screech into a ditch.

Mr. Briton is said by his wife to have seen a black dog going nine times round a tree; I don't know if that is true, but after much cross-questioning, and with additions from Mrs. Briton, I made out that he really had seen something one night, when going to see his wife, who was nursing a sick woman in a him some way off. By the side of the road he saw a lady, dressed in a very old-fashioned way, holding her skirt up; her hair, of a sandy colour, was divided and arranged in two knots on the top of her head. Though it was a pitch-dark night he saw her plainly, and said "Good night;" but she passed him without speaking, and vanished up the road. Mr. Briton riished into the farm where his wife was, and told her be had seen the devil.

"Had 'e got a tail?" said she, laughing.

"No, but 'e had horns," he said; for he thought she had, from the way her hair was arranged.

"You should have followed her, and she'd have shown you a treasure if you'd asked her in God's name what she wanted," said Mrs. Briton sagely; and he wished he had.

"But, why did you think she was the devil?" I asked him. "Oh, I s'pose 'twas just a wicked thought of mine," he said.

I gathered some stories from Mrs. Briton about a mythical person, supposed to have come from Kentchurch `[TH: near Grosmont]` near by, who went by the name of Jack Kent. He is associated with the Druidical stones at Trelleck, and the cleft on the Skyrrid.

"They say that when Jacky was a little boy he made a compact with the devil, which enabled him to do anything he set his hand to.

"Once he was engaged by a farmer to scare crows; but there was a fair going on in the town, and Jack didn't mean to miss it, so he called all the crows together from all the fields round, and when they were all collected he sent them into an old barn, with no roof to it. But Jack put the crows in there and said something to them, and they couldn't get out, try as they might So Jack, he went to the fair, but when he had been enjoying himself there a bit, he met his master. (Now his master had specially told him he was not to go to the fair, or else the crows would be after the crops.) So the farmer said, 'Hullo, Jack, what art doin' here? Didn't I tell thee to look after th' crows?' But Jack says, 'T' crows be all right, master.' And he took the farmer to the old barn, and sure enough there was the crows, and they couldn't get out, altho' that barn had no roof, until Jack told them to. `[Cf. Folklore Journal, i., 370 [TH: actually, 379] (where Kent is misprinted Rent); also vol. ii., p. 10, and F. Hindes Groome's In Gipsy Tents (Nimmo), p. 11, whose version of the story has been heard in Shropshire also. — Ed.]`

"Jack bested the devil in everything. One day they were walking through a turnip-field, and Jack made a bet that he could get more profit out of the field, if they shared it, than the devil could. (The turnips weren't above ground then, but Jack knew they were there.) Jack asked the Old Boy if he'd have Tops or Bottoms. He said 'Tops,' so Jack got the turnips and the Old Boy the greens.

"Next year the Devil took the bet again, an' this time he made sure he'd win, so he said he'd have Bottoms; but Jack, be had took precautions, an' that field came up wheat, so he got the corn an' straw, an' the Devil got the roots, which of course wasn't much good.

"Then they went to threshing. Jack was to have Bottoms this time, so he got the barn floor, and the Devil went on top; so he put up a hurdle for the Devil to thresh on, and as he battered away Jack had all the corn on the floor.

"Then they made a bargain that Jack was to build a bridge over Trothy Weir, Grosmont, before the cock crowed in the morning, but Jack did not before the cock crowed, and there the stones lie to this day, many a ton.

"Jack did some wonderful things in his time. Why! one day he jumped off the Sugar Loaf Mountain on to the Skyrrid (and there's his heel-mark in the Skyrrid to this day). An' when he got there he began playing quoits, he pecked (threw) three stones as far as Trelleck, great, big ones, as tall as three men (and there they still stand in a field), and he threw another, but that didn't go quite far enough, and it lay on the Trelleck Road, just behind the five trees, till a little while ago, when it was moved so as the field might be ploughed; and this stone, in memory of Jack, was always called the Pecked Stone.

"The Devil swore he'd have Jack's soul whether he were buried inside or outside the church; but when Jack died he was buried just under the wall of Grosmont Church, with his head inside and his legs outside, and a great stone (which has since been moved) was put to mark the place. So the Devil never got him."

In Monmouthshire there is a curious custom called "New Year's Gifts." On New Year's Eve the village children bring round apples, with three sticks for legs, and surmounted by a sprig of box adomed with hazel-nuts, fastened on by slitting the nut at the top and inserting a leaf of the sprig. I have heard, too, that in the spring, when the crops are just beginning to sprout, the men go into the field, taking cider with them, light a fire, and "say something" over the corn. On Good Friday it is right to bake a small loaf, which is to be kept till the same date next year; it will not go bad. Some of this loaf ground up is a certain cure for various illnesses.

Mrs. Briton says that if you kill an adder, and before sundown hold it over a flame of fire, its four legs will come out. She has seen it!

[John of Kent]

Grosmont is now a small and neat village; but was once a place of considerable importance, and is still governed by a mayor and burgesses. The natives boast of its former extent, point out spots at some distance which formed streets of the town, and allude to a tradition, that the market was once held on the side of the Graig. But a more decisive proof of its former importance is derived from the numerous causeways, which diverge from it in several directions, and which in any other county should have conceived to be remains of Roman roads. Two of these causeways may be traced to the distance of a mile, one leading towards the Graig and the Abergavenny road, and the other, towards the extremity of the village, in the direction of Scenfreth and Monmouth, which is supposed by the natives to have been a street of the town. These roads are raised to the height of several feet, and though much dilapidated, are still in many places from nine to twelve feet broad; the stones are laid one on the other, several which I measured were not less than nine feet in length, and of proportionate breadth and thickness. Within the memory of the inhabitants, roads of a similar construction led in other directions, but have been demolishied for the sake of the materials.

As Newcastle teems with tales of sprites and elves, so Grosmont rings with the achievements of John of Kent, whose exploits almost eclipse the adventures of baron Munkhausen. Old and young women, men and boys, unite in relating with extreme volubility, and without the smallest disagreement, a series of extraordinary tales concerning this wonderful personage. Like Dr. Faustus, he is faid to have made a compact with the devil; but more successful than the doctor, he evaded the conditions of his covenant, and outwitted the prince of darkness, both in his life and at his death.

Among the early specimens of his magical skill, while a farmer’s boy in the vicinity, he confined a number of crows, which he was ordered to keep from the

[image Grosmont Castle]

corn, in an old barn without a roof, that he might visit Grosmont fair. "And sure enough," said the old woman, who told me the anecdote, "they were there; for they made a terrible clatter, and would not fly away till Jack himself came and released them."

Kentchurch House, the neighbouring seat of the Scudamore family, by whom he was hired as a servant, became afterwards the scene of his marvellous exploits, which it would be tedious to recount. But the feat of all others, which most endears his memory to the inhabitants of Grosmont, was the construction of the bridge over the Monnow, leading to Kentchurch; it is still called John of Kent's bridge, and is said to have been built in one night by one of his familiar spirits. "But it could not be the devil, sir," added the relater of the tale, "for he would never have done so good an action."

An old tombstone in the church yard, close to the east wall of the chancel, is said to cover his body, and the legend reports, that he was interred under the wall to evade the condition of his compact which stipulated, that if buried either within the church, or out of the church, he should become the property of Satan. At the time of both my visits to Grosmont, this tomb was covered with a quantity of rubbish, which prevented me from inspecting it; but I was informed by the clerk, and by many other persons, that it contained no inscription.

A cellar at Kentchurch house is still shewn as the stable where he kept horse, on which he traversed the air with the speed of Lapland witches; and his portrait on wood, painted in oil, of which an engraving is annexed, is likewise there preserved.

The family of Kentchurch, to whom I applied for the true character and actions of this reputed sorcerer, could afford no specific or positive information. According to tradition, he was a monk, educated at one of the universities, and remarkable for his learning; in an age of ignorance, his acquirements excited the astonishment of his contemporaries, and like friar Bacon he was esteemed by the vulgar a necromancer. A Latin translation of the Bible, on vellum, which was either made or copied by him, was preserved in the family, but has been long mifsaid or destroyed.

Various opinions have been entertained concerning this mysterious perfonage. According to fome he was the John of Kent, Gwent, or Went, a Franciscan, thus mentioned by Leland: "He was bred in Wales, and so ardently followed the most celebrated schools of the Franciscans at Oxford, and made such improvements in profound learning, that he was the wonder of all his religious brethren." According to the antiquities of the English Franciscans, he was born at Chepstow, became professor and doctor of divinity, and on account of his extraordinary virtue was chosen minister provincial of the order in England. He wrote many learned and pious works, particularly Commentaries on the Master of the Sentences, Sermons to the People, and Disputed Questions. He died in 1348; and the catalogue of the provincial ministers says of him, "Brother John Went, doctor of Oxford, who wrought miracles in his life time, lies at Hereford." Baker, in his Chronicle, mentions another John of Kent among the men of learning in the reign of Henry the third `[Leland, Scrip. Brit, p.376. Antiq. of the E. Francisc. p. 159. Baker's Chronicle, p. 132.]`.

According to others he was a bard of Owen Glendower, and became domesticated in the family on the defeat of his chieftain, whose daughter married a Scudamore.

A tradition however fhill prevails, that an old wizard, difgnlfed in a fliepherd’s habit, once roamed about in the neighbourhood of Grofmont, frequented Kentchurch Houfe, and was buried privately under the Hone in the church yard,, below the eaft window of the chancel, which is called John of Kent’s tombftone. A refpedtable perfon, long relident in the village of Kentchurch, from whom I derived this information, conjeflures that this wizard was Owen Glendower himfelf, who, when proferibed, wandered about in a (hepherd’s habit, and took refuge with one of his daughters. It is likewife remarkable, that the ’place of Owen Glendower’s death, or fepulture, has never been pofitively afeertained ; fome fuppofe, though without fufficient authority, that he was interred


[Image John of Kent]

at Mornington in Herefordshire, the feat of one of his sons in law, others, with still less probability, that he was buried in the cathedral of Bangor.

`[A curious passage from the Memoirs of Owen Glendower is here submitted to the reader, p. 73. "A. D. 1415, death put a period to Owen's life and misery upon the eve of St. Matthew. Some say he died at his daughter Scudamore’s, others at his daughter Mornington’s house. They had both harboured him in his forlorn condition. They say that he was fain to go up and down disguised in a shepherd’s habit, to his daughters' and other friends' houses. Where Owen was buried cannot now be ascertained. But my countrymen, whether from tradition or conjecture, know not, suppose a grave under the great window in the fouth isle wall of Bangor cathedral, to be his place of interment. This mural monument is singular and much noticed; it lies within the wall, having a hollow arch over it, and a short buttress to support it. The stone, which is of the grit kind, has no inscription on it, or any adornment besides a large ill formed cross." "Humphrey, a late bishop of Bangor, and a great antiquary, did not credit this report, but firm;y believed, from a passage in Giraldus' Itinerary, that it was the mausoleum of Owen Gwynedd, prince of North Wales. A. D. 1138."

Though now an insignificant cluster of habitations, Grosmont was formerly a town of some note. Many exterior traces of buildings, and raised causeways, constructed like Roman roads with large blocks of stone, diverging from it, prove its antique extent and importance to have been considerable: nor is the legend of the place deficient in asserting its quondam consequence.

But with still higher interest, with more voluble earnestness, the natives recount the exploits of their reputed necromancer, John of Kent. Among a thousand other instances of his magical skill, they confidently assure you, that when he was a hoy, being ordered to protect some corn from the birds, he conjured all the crows in the neighbourhood into a barn without a roof, and by force of his incantations obliged them to remain there while he visited Grosmont fair. A greater service that he performed for the countrywas, his building the bridge over the Monnow in one night by the agency of one of his familiars. Long did his strange actions frighten men out of their wits; and at length, dying, he outwitted the devil; for, in consideration of services while living, he agreed to surrender himself to his satanic majesty after his death, whether he was buried in or out of church; but, by ordering his body to be interred under the church wall, he contrived to slip out of the contract. A stone in the church-yard, near the chancel, is said to mark the spot of this interment.

Higher tradition relates, that this extraordinary personage was a monk, who, possessing a greater knowledge in natural philosophy than could at that time be generally comprehended, was reputed a sorcerer. The family of the Scudamores, at Kentchurch-house, about a mile from Grosmont, where he became domesticated, had a Latin translation of the Bible written by him on vellum, but which is now lost. An ancient painting of him upon wood is, however, preserved in the mansion; and a cellar in the house is described to have been the stable of his horses; steeds of no vulgar pedigree, which carried him through the air with more than the speed of witches.

From a collation of different legends and circumstances, several respectable enquirers are inclined to believe, that this necromancer was no other than the famous Owen Glendower; who, after his defeat, and the dispersion of his army, concealed himself in the disguise of a bard, or wizard. A strong circumstance which favours this conjecture is, that the daughter of Glendower married a Scudamore, who at the time occupied Kentchurch-house. It may also be remarked, that neither the time of the chief's death, nor the place of his sepulture, were ever positively ascertained.

Upon our return to Monmouth from this excursion, we had the good fortune to fall into the company of Mr. Wathen of Hereford, the benefit of whose local information apd obliging assiduities has been felt by numerous tourists, as well as ourselves. This gentleman pointed out the most striking beauties of the Wye toward Ross; and of his directions we gladly availed ourselves the following morning, when we bade adieu to Wales and Monmouthshire. But, as it is my object to effect a general delineation of that tract of country, I shall not hesitate to break the thread of my tour, and suspend a description of the Wye's scenery and some further continuance of our route, while I traverse the north-western part of Monmouthshire, and the eastern frontier of South-Wales, which yet remains unexplored. In this part of my work, I must describe things as they appeared to me six years since, when I visited this portion of country in my return from a tour through the North of England and Wales, assisted by the best documents and observations that I have since been able to procure.
