A Tale of the Forest of Dean

TO DO - check from clausde.ai

The Forest of Dean belongs to Her Most Gracious Majesty, and is situated in the western district of Gloucestershire. It is about twenty miles long, and ten broad. Its wealth consists in productive coal and iron mines, stone quarries, and majestic oaks. One portion of this forest, abutting on the Wye, abounds in woodland scenes of tranquil beauty; another portion, stretching to the Severn, is bolder, and, as the Guide Books would say, more romantic "in its features." It was near the Severn that I lived when the events occured around me which I intend to narrate.

For many years the Forest of Dean was grossly neglected; its timber was cut down and no young trees were planted to fill up the vacancies. This system was carried so far, that, in my father's young days, large portions of the country nominally forest were completely without trees. Upon such treeless portions, or wherever else they chose, the neighbouring farmers considered themselves perfectly entitled to encroach. Some had actually enclosed for themselves portions of the royal property, and built cottages thereon, into which no constable ever walked to inquire by what right this unauthorised squatting took place. Acres, by the hundred, of forest land, having been thus appropriated, the district swarmed with population. Any cottager possessing pigs or sheep, cattle or donkies, turned his dumb dependents out into the forest, where they found free commons in its grassy nooks, as freely and unhesitatingly as if their owners' rights were enrolled on parchment, and had been bought with lawful money.

The Government decided that a check should be put on these proceedings, and determined to enclose the forest. Discontent accordingly prevailed among the foresters. At the Speech House—in the centre of the forest, and from time immemorial the forum of the district—meetings were held. While foresters denounced the Government proceeding, Government proceeded with its work. Trespassing sheep and cattle were impounded; if any rash adventurer commenced the building of a cottage within the royal ground, its walls were "tumbled." The enclosures were completed, while the foresters bewailed, or threatened in the Speech House, with about as much chance of what the speakers were pleased to call "redress," as a vagrant has, when he threatens appeal against the decision of the magistrate.

Mrs Winifred Kear was among those who were affected by the Government proceedings. By profession she was an ash-burner—in other words, a humble manufacturer of alkali; a term, however, which she has never heard in her life. She cut down fern, burned it, and from the ashes, with the aid of water, kneaded a substance into little round balls, which she sold to the surrounding housewives, for the purpose of softening the water in their tubs on washingdays. Out of the ashes of a vast number of ferns, with frugality to aid her in her alchemy, she had extracted a few pieces of gold, and with those she had built a little cottage, enclosing round it a quite liberal allowance of the royal ground, which she had made into a garden. She had also bred some sheep of a small hardy breed, producing very fine wool—a breed, I believe, peculiar to our forest. She had also a cow, who was a member, in fact, of Winny's family, and was accustomed to come "but and ben," as inclination led her. Winny's cottage was built in accordance with the architectural design to which our forest cottages in general conform. It had four rooms, two on the ground-floor and two above for the main part, with a back-kitchen as appendix. There was no lack of gay flowers in the garden, and Winny had not omitted to lay the foundations of an orchard. A vine grew over the cottage wall, and there was a jessamine that climbed over the green wooden porch, but it was not Winny that planted that. At any rate, I do not think it was, for all the neighbours said that Winny was a witch. When I was a young and lusty man she was an old tottering creature—not the woman, I think, to plant jessamine about her door. Jack Prosser, her factotum, never planted it, I'm sure. He was a wild Orson of a fellow. Went about with his hairy chest exposed, and no hat on his shaggy penthouse; which could be distinguished only by its anatomical position as a head of hair. No storm ever wetted Jack Prosser to the scalp; and his thick dirty hands, I am quite sure, never could have planted jessamine. Mary Llewellyn planted it when she was an orphan child. Now she is the mother of a fine young man who attends medical lectures at University College, and comes home to the forest in vacation time, to turn his nose up at the ignorance of me, his father.

Mary lived in the time I tell you of, with Winny Kear, who was her mother's mother. Winny petted her preposterously. I did not think so then, but I do now. I frequently remark to Mrs Wyville, that if our little rogue had been taken from her grandmother in early life it would have been a great blessing to both of us. As a damsel, Mary was extremely pastoral. In the morning she arose, milked her cow, Truelove, and placed the milk in bright tin pans to cream. Then she led breakfast, went to pastoral duties to the sheep, returned home again, and then went to the well for water. At the well it was a daily accident that I should chance to meet her. Having quarrelled with me there, she would go home, tuck up her sleeves, and play at cook till dinner time. After dinner she would decorate herself and go to the next village, shopping, if she could find anything to want, and had any money left to buy it with. Then she came home, and spent the evening in sewing and knitting; or in dancing, when it was a gay time and dances were afoot. I suppose that is how forest maidens usually live.
Now, in the opinion of the foresters, Jack Prosser was an able man. These good people are exclusively known to one another by some nickname, and Jack Prosser's nickname was the "Counsellor." Winny Kear being a witch, it was fair to suppose her man a gifted person; therefore Jack Prosser was the forest counsellor, the village Hampden, and so on. The result of forest meetings came at length in the shape of a decision that the banks of the enclosures should be levelled, and the forest once again thrown open. Of this movement Mr Prosser was appointed leader.

On the 10th of May, 18—, Mr Prosser attempted to wash his face and hands, to the intense astonishment of Miss Llewellyn, before whom he appeared in a model condition, as she sat knitting under an apple-tree. There is no doubt whatever, now, that Jack chuckled, and scratched his head. Mr Prosser made a declaration of affection, in short; but his manner was so mysterious, his words were so unutterable, that although he left Miss Llewellyn under the impression that he had proposed himself her future husband, and that he had been accepted as such; the lady herself had not the smallest suspicion of the purport of his declaration. It was not, in fact, until Jack had gone off in a state of rapture, and until Mary began to reflect, that the idea of Jack's "intentions" entered her imagination. She resolved, however, to take an early opportunity of undeceiving him.


Now it was Whitsuntide, and Whitsuntide is the great holiday season in the Forest of Dean. A very pleasant season, too, it is for anybody living in a forest, when the trees put on their first fresh leaves, and the orchards are in blossom, and the hawthorn too; when birds are making up for their long silence, and the bees again are busy. In the Forest of Dean every hamlet has, at this season, its wake or village festival; and morris-dancing is the business of life. Every morris-dancer throws aside his coat and waistcoat, to display a shirt covered with party-coloured ribbons twisted into rosettes for him by his sweetheart. Happy the maid who has decked out her lover with the gayest finery; she loves to see her ribbons glorified. Then the dancers put themselves on feathers also, and hang bells about their knees. The foremost dancer wields a staff, on which are inscribed the initials of the district to which his morris belongs. Our dancing-ground was Blakeney Hill. That hill is green to the summit, and its sides are covered with cottage gardens, and were then gay and sweet with apple-blossom. From the top you see the Severn parted from you by narrow dells and orchards, with Blakeney village set in the rustic picture like a black-bird's egg in a green nest of moss. On the top of this hill is a level platform, where has been always held the Blakeney Hill wake. To this wake all the different forest districts used to send forth their sets of morris-dancers; each set had its own dancing-ground, and you might see twenty or thirty companies, of forty or more couples, all tripping it at one time merrily.

On the 10th of May, 18—, I walked with Mary Llewellyn to this wake, soon after her interview with Mr Prosser. Mary was very joyous; we wandered, I may say, scampered, to and fro; the distant fiddles and the tink'ing of the morris-bells possibly made me sentimental. I twisted some wild flowers into a true love-knot, and offered them to Miss Llewellyn; she blushed, and put the flowers in her bosom. I offered her my arm, on which she put her hand for the first time. My future fate as a domestic man was decided then; it was a happy one; and when we reached the dancing-ground I joined with Miss Llewellyn a jolly circle of morris-dancers and I believe we danced to the astonishment of all beholders; for we were both glad, and our heels were dancing.

Thereupon proceeded Mr. Prosser to claim Mary for a dance. Mary at first, and then followed a few words

of explanation, which begot no friendship towards me from Mr Jack. When we came home, Farmer Grimes solemnly warned me against "being too sweet upon Polly Llewellyn," because she was a witch's grandchild, and the old woman had caused his wagon to stick for two hours in a rut opposite her cottage. I pooh-poohed Father Grimes, who, consequently, considered me a doomed lad.

Two miles from Lydney rises a bold table-land called the Bailey; a wild, heath-like place, commanding fine views of the Severn, the neighbourhood of Park End, and the picturesque woodland church of St. Paul's. The Bailey itself looks wild and desolate; there you have holly-trees and furze-bushes; and there we had, in July 18—, a meeting of some thousand foresters. Every district of the forest had sent to the general muster a supply of men with spades and pickaxes; yea, verily, and some with swords and muskets, that gave no very military look to warriors in smock-frocks, velveteens, and hob-nailed shoes. Counsellor Prosser addressed the assembly. Farmer Grimes wanted to know whether they would throw the banks down, in case soldiers came? The resolution passed in answer to Farmer Grimes's query was to the effect, that if the soldiers—a regiment or so—did come, the banks were to be allowed to stand; but, if the military force were small, and the foresters could overcome it, the fences were to be demolished. The foresters then separated into several detachments, each under its leader, and each appointed to destroy a certain part of the embankments. The rattle of spades and pickaxes shortly resounded; the levelling of every bank was celebrated with cheers remorselessly noisy, and serious alarm spread through the surrounding country. It was reported that the forest was in complete insurrection; that men regularly drilled and armed possessed the almost inaccessible recesses; and that Robin Hood did nothing in comparison with what was to be expected from the men of Dean.

Having razed the embankments, the bold foresters turned loose their cattle upon the forbidden ground; formed an encampment upon a rough ridge, called Putnage; and sent round detachments to exact contributions from adjacent villages and farms. The alarmed neighbours paid the black-mail. The local authorities swore in a multitude of special constables, and sent to London for the military. Sure enough, down the soldiers came.

The forest army under General Jack Prosser looked like a gipsy camp. The moment the camp was formed, the General thought the victory was won, and proceeded at once to sit down in peaceful triumph upon his laurels; the very way to crush them. The enemy, consisting of a goodly array of the troops in the pay of Her Most Gracious Majesty came into the forest, expecting a vigorous resistance from men armed to the teeth, and opposing their breasts fanatically to the bayonet. The regulars were, however, grievously deceived. The insurgents did not wait even to discover what the smell of gunpowder was like, but scampered off at the first sound of the drum and fife.

Now, I had pretty hotly joined the movement, because it concerned very closely the fortunes of Mrs Winny Kear, the grandmother of the sweetheart of my bosom, and the capital encroacher upon the public land. Being sound in wind and limb, and young in blood, I endeavoured to oppose myself to timid counsel, and to stir up the foresters to fight.

"A spy!" cried Mr Prosser; "he is bribed to get us into trouble. Lay hold of him."

They did lay hold of me; they tied me, gagged me, and dragged me off. Mr Prosser's motive was revenge; and the foresters of Little Dean, who had got hold of me, being the roughest men of our community, carried the business a little to extremes. They took me to a coal-pit, which had been recently deserted, and sent me down there by the windlass. The man who went down with me discharged me at the bottom like rubbish from the basket, and was wound up again.

This might have been, and would have been a case of murder, if it were possible for a dozen countrymen to know a secret, and for none of them to leave it behind him at an alehouse. At eleven o'clock that night, Mary Llewellyn, who had sought me since noon, like a loving little soul, obtained a mere hint of my whereabouts. She knocked up Farmer Grimes who had been then two hours in bed, coaxed him to go with her into the rain, and let her down the pit. He went with her and let her down; he could not go himself, because she would not have relied upon her strength to wind him up again. She came down with a lantern, found me, and put brandy between my lips —then put something much sweeter upon my lips. After I got out of that pit, I lost no time in getting into another; we were married in Blakeney Church.—Well, well. Away with melancholy!

Several leaders of the forest outbreak having been taken and tried, their Commander-in-Chief, Mr Posser, among others, went abroad. The cases of old Mrs Winny Kear and others who had built cottages trespassingly on forest ground, were carefully dealt with by the Government, and leases were granted to them at a peppercorn rent for various terms, according to the length of time the several encroachments had existed. Winny fell asleep in peace, when death arrived to do for her what she had been doing all her life;—to gather her for ashes. I cannot say that since then I have lived in peace. But I am happy.

Shocking Murder in the Forest of Dean.— A powerful sensation has been produced the Forest of Dean, by the murder a labourer named Philip Cooke, under the following circumstances.— It appears that the deceased, who lived at the Cross Ways, near Coleford, and had been employed for a short time in stripping bark at Usk, was returning home on Saturday night se'nnight, when on passing through the Beaulieu Wood, he observed a woman with a child in her arms, standing by two persons who were lying on the ground. He accosted the woman, and inquired what was the matter, when she told him that the men were intoxicated. He proffered bis assistance, and the men, who turned out to be Irish tinkers, and hawkers of list shoes, got up, and with his aid proceeded through the wood. On reaching Stanton, one of the Irishmen wished to have more beer, and a quarrel arose between them on the subject, in which however Cooke took no part. Cooke then said to the woman "you had better come on with me, as I shall be a better guard for you than these two fellows." He had scarcely uttered these words when the Irishmen both set upon him and beat him dreadfully, trampling upon him when down with hobnailed shoes. At last they left off, and Cook got up and made the best of his way towards Coleford. The men loitered and then pursued him, keeping his pace. It was nearly twelve o'clock when the party arrived at the Cross Ways, where Cooke lived. The latter went into his house, put down his things, and then ran and called a man of the name of Henry Yorke and another named Jordon, the turnpike keeper. Yorke got up, followed his wife, and came into the road at the time when the Irish party were passing through the turnpike. The woman cried out, "what are you going to beat the old man for?"— to which Yorke replied that he was not going to beat any one. During this time Cooke stood with his hands crossed in the middle of the road, and Yorke demanded why they had been beating Cooke; on this the Irishwoman whispered to one of the men to get a stone, when he retired a pace or two back, where there was a broken stone fence, and taking two large slate stones in either hand advanced upon Cooke, saying, "I'll split thy skull for thee;" he instantly flung one of the stones with all his force, and struck the unfortunate man on the temple. Cooke dropped, apparently dead; and Jordan and Yorke made an attempt to capture the ruffian, who declared that he would serve them in the same manner if they came near him. They followed him down to a lodging-house between the Cross-Ways and Coleford, into which he entered, but escaped by the back-door, and has not since been heard of. The other man and the woman were captured a few hours afterwards. Cooke lingered in a most distressing state until Thursday morning, when he expired. The stone had perforated his forehead, and the brain was only covered by a thin tegument, so that it is very surprising how he survived so long. The deceased bore an excellent character, and has left a wife and two children to lament his loss. He was about 40 years of age.

MURDER AND SUICIDE. A most dreadful murder and suicide were committed in the Forest of Dean oh Monday night, about seven o'clock, by a man of the name of Philip Willis, a foreman in the employ of Messrs. James and Co., of Sydney. Willis held the situation of underground agent in some mines in the Forest of Dean. the property of the Cinderford Iron Company, and was very comfortably off, the cottage in which he resideded, and the orchard adjoining, being his own property; he had also two houses at Bream. The unfortunate man had heen for some time in an unsound state of mind, and about six months ago he became an inmate of the lunatic asylum at Whitchurch, from which establishment he was discherged in about six weeks, with a certificate of cure. On the 10th of May last he cut his throat, but through the skilful attention of Mr. Marsh, surgeon, of Coleford, he recovered. For the last fortnight a man had always slept with him, but on Monday, his wife informed this man that she considered her hushand so much better, that she should not be afraid to occupy the same bed with him. During the whole of Monday, he was excited and nervous, seeming to he afraid of everyone who came near him, and about five o'clock on Monday evening, Willis, his wife, and daughter, a very pretty and most amiable girl, and of whom he was most doatingly fond, sat down to tea together; just before tea he kissed his child, and said. "You don't know, my dear Ann, how I love you." He also knelt duwn and prayed, as he often used to do, that the Lord would strengthen his mind. After tea the daughter went outside the cottage door, and was in the act of chopping sticks to light the fire next morning, when her father, who had taken a hacker (an instrument resembling a bill-hook), went quietly behind her, and as she stooped aimed a deadly blow at the back of her head, and buried the hacker in her skull, which was cut through in a most frightful manner. Immediately on receiving the blow she cried out "Oh, dear! oh, dear?" Her mother, hearing this, rushed out, and was met in the doorway by Willis, who attempted to cut her down. A dreadful struggle ensued between the hushand and the terror-stricken wife, in which the latter received a dreadful cut in the arm, and a deep gash was inflicted on the left shoulder, her gown and under garments were cut through, and her faced bruised, both eyes being blackened and much swollen. Whilst the struggle was going on, the poor girl (wonderful to relate) went to a neighbour's cottage, forty yards distant from the scene of blood. Mr. Marsh, of Coleforf, was soon in attendance, but she died in about an hour after having received the injury. She spoke several times, and asked why her father had not come to her? The neighbours being alarmed, ran to Mrs. Willis's assistance, who, on seeing them, exclaimed, "Run, for your lives, into the orchard; my husband is gone there." They immediately went in search of him, and, horrible to relate, found him at the foot of one of the trees, with his throat cut in a most shocking manner, his right hand grasping the razor. The poor wretch was still alive, but he died in a very few minutes after being discovered. The escape of the wife was almost miraculous, and it was a providential occurrence that his other two children were absent from home on a visit, or it is probable that they, too, would have fallen victims to his fury. His wife says he was a most excellent husband and fond father; indeed, his love for the poor girl who fell by his hand was extreme. He would not even let her go to chapel by herself, fearing she might come to harm.

Willis was fifty-two years of age, and his unfortuante daughter only seventeen.

THE IRON-MINES OF THE FOREST OF DEAN. Some of the primitive iron-mines in the Forest are great curiosities, although they easily escape the attention of a stranger, from their secluded situation, and the obscurity of their entrances. A small aperture, not unlike a fox-earth, amongst projecting masses of limestone rock, admits the miner to the scene of his labours. He descends partly by wooden pegs driven into the soil, and partly by the help of a short ladder which he carries with him, and thus arrives in the subterranean labyrinth, from which he excavates the ore. These mines arc worked by labouring men, who are "free miners" under the old Forest laws, assisted by their families; and the ore is carried to the surface by young boys, in packages called "billies," which are secured on the back, and thus secured they crawl on hands, knees, and feet, from the recesses of the mine, till they climb into daylight. The hands and knees of these poor boys are frequently perfectly hoofed; the skin being covertcd into a bony texture by continual pressure. The iron ore, lying "pockets" or "churns" as they are called by the miners, ribbed in by the limestone rock, leaves iregular passages and caverns all directions, after it has been dug out, so that the interior presents the most grotesque combinations of pillars, cells, grottoes, lofty domes, and narrow, low corridors of variously coloured limestone, the effect of which, under the partial illumination of the miners' candles, is often very imposing. This class of iron mines is now in very partial operation, in consequence of the application of capital to improved methods of mining on a larger scale.—The scene which the writer wishes to describe is the site of probably the most ancient mine-works the kingdom, and not visited so frequently as it deserves to be. It lies near the village of Bream, on the left of the turnpike-road, leading from Lydney to Coleford, and is known by the provincial appellation of "The Scowles," a name commonly applied to old mine works, and probably derived, as suggested by a learned Forest Commissioner, fron the British *Ceawl*, signifying cavern or excavation. In the recesses of a wood near some of the primitive mines, you suddenly enter upon what at first sight appears to be an extensive and confused ruin, in a deep dell, overgrown with ivy and lichen, and interspersed with lofty trees. These masses are, in reality, the limestone rock left in its natural formations after the iron ore had been carried away by the old British and Roman miners, who appear to have pursued a course of mining downwards from the surface, clearing out the superficial "churns," as far as they extended in every direction, and thus leaving cavities and elevations, to which a long course of years has given their present romantic appearance by obliterating all traces of the process, and clothing every hollow with vegetation. Tall and spreading trees flourish on the very summits of some of the natural columns that rear their lofty forms amidst this wild scene; others extend their branches over clustering rocks covered with moss and creeping plants, whilst devious paths winding their way amongst these relics of nature, exposed by art, invite the visitor's tarriance, whilst he indulges in the musing mood which such a spot is calculated to inspire. But the most singular portion of these nntique srowles is a grotesque mass of rocks, called "The Devil's Chapel," in which is a pulpit vast dimensions, appropriated by the country people to the infernal oratory of Satan, when he officiates on solemn occasions amongst his congregations of demons and witches, there assembled. In truth, it is a scene well adapted to superstitious imaginings, and to old tales of witchcraft and *diablerie*, in which the arch-demon and his earthly colleagues, celebrate their nocturnal orgies. A cloudy midnight in such a place, with glimpses of moonshine just revealing its rugged horrors, and profound shades; a fitful night-wind, and flapping boughs, with now and then the cry of an ill-omened bird, startling the ear, would soon make a susceptible imagination run wild, peopling the solitude with its unutterable visions. For my own part, in the sweet spring air, and the softened light of an April morning, the scene impressed me with no unhallowed fancies. It led back my imagination to the barbarous infancy of our now enlightened land; filled my thoughts with pictures of the past and musings on the present; with reflections on the transit of generation after generation, and across the disc of mortality, each leaving behind it contributions of knowledge and ingenuity, whilst its own final destinies are elsewhere. In the midst of my cogitation, a devotional feeling emanated, alike from their nature and the seclusion in which they originated. I referred the progressive improvement of our race in science, in art, and in morals, to the intellectual endowments bestowed on us, by Him who reigns supreme over universal existence; and offered up my grateful orisons for the faculties which enabled me to think, to reason, and to feel as I then did—to exult in the emotions of taste, and whilst acknowledging myself "the creature of an hour," recognise an immortal alliance with the Eternal Father, "to whom a thousand years are as one day." A Way-farer.

200 years ago in the neighbourhood, which was thought
to be that of a man 11 or 12 feet high, but was in reality
[illegible] the bones of some fossil animal, were those of one
of Vortigern's soldiers. Vortigern retreated into Wales
after the battle at Amesbury, in Wiltshire, in A.D. 457,
and it is thought took refuge at the Doward before going
into Radnorshire, where he was burned in his castle. But
there is no doubt that this neighbourhood was the scene
of many a desperate encounter between the Saxons and
the Welsh, and even so late as 1640, property was very
insecure, and great losses were sustained by the
incursions of predatory marauders. The Roman station,
Blestium, is supposed to be that of Monmouth and
that of Ariconium about two miles from Ross.
A large number of natural caves or caverns occur in
places on both sides of the river, in some cases 200 to
300 feet above the present level of the water; two or
three on the left bank, of which the largest and most
curious is "The Doward," although but little visited,
from its isolated and rocky situation, is entered by a
small opening four feet wide by two feet high. After a
short scramble on hands and knees you reach a cavern in
the deepest part of which you can just stand upright.
Two openings lead inwards and downwards, but unite at
a distance of from 30 to 40 yards. From this point you
may wander for an hour or more through small passages
and some considerable caverns beautifully ornamented
by stalactite and stalagmite. One is called the Devil's Chapel. Another cavern has recently been opened out by a mine shaft; this has an arched roof about thirty
feet high; is about one hundred feet long, by fifty
wide. But the most famous is of course that which
has long been known as King Arthur's cave or hall.
In reference to this cave, it is reported that the rhinoceros
bones were so plentiful that a neighbouring farmer carted
them out to manure his land, and thus, it is said, led to
the explorations and discoveries which have since been
made by the Rev. W. S. Symonds, M.A., of Pendock,
and other gentlemen. In clearing out the rubbish on the
upper surface, they found portions of two human skele-
tons, and pottery of the Romano-British period. The top

WOOLHOPE NATURALISTS' FIELD CLUB.
CURSORY NOTES ON THE FOREST OF DEAN,
AND SOME OF THE OBJECTS WITHIN IT.

BY EDWIN LEES, F.L.S., F.G.S., VICE-PRESIDENT OF THE
MALVERN AND WORCESTERSHIRE NATURALISTS' CLUBS.

What can be shortly said about the ancient Forest of
Dean may be almost comprised in what Mr. Pepys puts
in his gossiping Diary under date of August, 1662, when
he says that he had a "good discourse" with Sir John
Winter, "a very worthy man, most of which was con-
cerning the Forest of Dean, and the timber there, and
iron works, with their great antiquity; and the vast
heaps of cinders which they find, and are now of great
value, being necessary for the making of iron at this
day; and without which they cannot work."

The general idea of a forest is that of ground densely
covered by majestic trees, but whatever may have been
its aspect in pre-historic times, it has been so despoiled
in various ways that in the present day Dean Forest is
only a forest in name, but few extensive patches of wood
occur to charm the eye, scarcely any old trees of extra-
ordinary size remain, while wastes of bare heathy ground
with scattered coal and ironworks are the more apparent
features of this tract of country. Where ground has
been preserved for plantations they consist only of
young trees.

The woody region appears to most advantage and at-
tractive to a lover of sylvan scenery when, crossing the
river Wye from Whitchurch, either towards Symond's
Yat, or from thence looks down upon the Coldwell
Rocks, and the woods that extend from thence, or pro-
ceeds by a lower route through the sylvan coverts that inter-
vene between Symond's Yat and Coleford. Here on a
fervid summer day he might be inclined to say with one
of our poets (Gay)—

"Lead me, guard me from the sultry hours,
Hide me, ye forests, in your closest bowers,
Where the tall oak his spreading arms entwines,
And with the beech a mutual shade combines."

Dean Forest had indeed the closest bowers throughout a
wide extent when Drayton described it as—

Traces of the ancient iron works in the forest are
evident in abandoned caverns and deep excavations,
some of which are open to-day, and bear the curious
name of Scowles. On my first visit to the Forest of
Dean a friend, residing near Coleford, directed my at-
tention to the remarkable excavations called the Scowles,
at Bream, about two miles from Lydney. The place
being hidden by bushes is not easily found by a stranger,
and on making inquiries of persons I met on the road,
the term Scowles did not seem familiar to them. At
last, addressing some colliers, one of them said, "He
must mean the devil's chapel," and this proved to be
the fact, and so I was guided to the desired spot.
These scowles I found to be deep narrow excava-
tions among rugged rocks, winding about according as
the old miners had followed the vein and churns of ore,
deepening as they went, and leaving these catacomb-like
passages, which in the lapse of time had got covered
with vegetation, and crested with beeches or the dark
verdure of shattered yews, making a singular and roman-
tic appearance. The rocks on either side of these narrow
gullies are nearly or quite perpendicular, and in some
places a shadowy gloom oppresses the explorer. In one
part of this demoniacal chapel is a lofty rock called the
devil's pulpit, where ancient superstition supposed the
enemy of mankind to show his horns at certain times,
and direct the operations of a crowd of demons and
witches there assembled. These labyrinths were cer-
tainly the toil of many years, and thus abandoned are
well adapted to superstitious imaginings and wild ideas,
especially when contemplated on a cloudy evening, or
by moonlight, when the gloomy winding aisles are only
half revealed, and a night wind moans among the flap-
ping boughs above, the still solitude only otherwise dis-
turbed by the shrill cry of some startled ill-omened
bird.. (Here was shown a sketch of the devil's chapel).
The roots of trees run down these isolated rocks in a
most remarkable manner, and on a gloomy day, when
the dark branches of the crested trees shut out the light
of heaven, a scene described by Hood in one of his poems
may be realized to an imaginative observer—

It was a wild and solitary glen,
Made gloomy by vast yews with foliage dark,
Where through'd roots like bones of buried men
Push'd through the rotten soil for fear's remark;
A hundred horrid stems jagged and stark,
Struggled with twisted arms in hideous fray."

It is tradition, the oral handing on of oral knowledge y that is the means by which the most of our folklore material has been, and is being, preserved. Tradition as a process deserves examination. We ought to know what are its conditions, its limits, its possibilities ...

 Now it is first to be noted that in many unlettered, that is, in my sense, bookless, communities, there are special means, pieces of social machinery, devised and practical for the preservation of the knowledge of the events and culture of the past...

 The secular or bardic schools of mediaeval Ireland comprised a twelve-year course ; that is to say, a pupil could not compass it in less than twelve years...

Wizardry on the Welsh Border. Beatrix A. Wherry, pp75-87

Wizardry on the Welsh Border.

(Read at Meetings 17th February, 1904)

[The following article, by a young lady who is still at school, is inserted in all its fulness of picturesque detail partly on account of the admirable object lesson it affords in the collection of folklore. Boys and girls have a great advantage in this work in the ease with which they can vanquish the barriers of racial or class prejudice, which are after all the main difficulties to be overcome. Miss Wherry has given fictitious names to her informants, but the genuineness of her narratives must be self-evident to any one who knows the garrulous dramatic visionary folk of the Welsh Marches. Readers will not fail also to note the close correspondence of the relative positions of witch and wise man in Monmouthshire with those of the witch and witch-doctor in Central Africa, as described in the preceding paper. — Ed.]

While staying at a farmhouse in Monmouthshire this summer, I tried to collect some stories about the wise men, ghosts, and superstitions of the place. I was indebted to our landlady, Mrs. Briton, for many of them, but she referred me to an old Mrs. Pryce, who, she said, could tell me more stories than anyone.

I first made the acquaintance of Mrs. Pryce in the stable-yard wishing to sell a "fine oak table." She was a weird-looking figure in her heavy cloak and cottage bonnet, but the most striking feature about her was the curious penetrating brightness of her eyes. Next day we all trooped down to see the table in her cottage at Trelleck. She was more witch-like than ever; so much so that I looked around for the black cat, which, however, was not forthcoming; she gave long histories of the usual six children whom she had buried, also of her quarrels with her landlord. She also wished to sell some chairs, for she said, "I've no need of chairs, being all alone, and I have the bench I used to kill pigs upon, 'twill not be used for that agen, so I may so well sit on it so long as I do live."

Two or three days afterwards she came up for the money for her table. Drawing me mysteriously out of the room she whispered on the stairs, "They're after me for the rent." She got her money and was then prevailed upon to "take a drop o' cider." I then took the opportunity of asking her if she knew anything about Jenkyns, the wise man, in whom I was very much interested, having heard a great deal about him.

"Lor' bless you, me dear," said she, "Why, Jenkyns 'as been a comfort to me all me life. If I ever 'ad a pain of any sort, rheumaticks, toothache, or what ye like, if I'd go to Jenkyns 'e'd always take it away. Anything that were lost, in all the country-side, 'e'd always find it. 'Deed I did miss old Jenkyns when 'e died, and many's the time I've wished 'im back agen."

I asked her what old Jenkyns' appearance was, and gathered that he was an oldish man, with a long dark beard; stooping, and walking with a stick. "He allus wore one o' those box 'ats," said Mrs. Pryce, "an' an old round coat about the house, but when 'e went to town 'e put on a long coat with tails,"

"But have you ever seen any of his charming, Mrs. Pryce?"

"Lor' bless you, yes, me dear," said she; "many an' many a time, but onst in particular I were dreadful skeered, an' I'll tell you all about it. One day one of me brothers had a toothache, so him an' me an' me other brother went up to old Jenkyns to have it charmed away. Jenkyns could charm away anything; many a time, when I've had rheumaticks or pain of any sort I'd go to Jenkyns an' say, 'Oh! Jenkyns, I do feel so bad, take away my pain, do now;' 'an' 'e'd say,' 'Well now, d'ye believe?' 'Oh, yes, I believe,' say I, an' there! the pain 'ud be gone.

"Well, as I was sayin', when the toothache was gone, Jenkyns went out o' the kitchen to fetch a drop o' cider, an' me brother see'd a big, big book on the comer of the table, an' began to look at it. Jenkyns hollers out from the other side of the house, 'Don't you touch that book, or it'll be the worse for you!' When 'e came back me brother says, 'You must have got the Old Man 'imself about 'ere to have such like goings on,' says 'e. Just then there came a great noise in the room above, bowling about the floor, like as if a great big ball were rollin' about 'All right,' says Jenkyns, 'if you don't look out, youll have him a bit closer.'

"With that 'e takes a candle an' blows into it, puts it on the table, an' draws a circle round it. Then the light all burnt dim an' blue, and the whole room got cloudy an' misty. Presently, we see'd a little old man sittin' in a chair next to Jenkyns, 'e was rockin' 'imself to and fro, and squeakin', 'Jenky, Jenky, Jenky!' an' again, 'Jenky, Jenky, Jenky!' Now 'e 'adn't come thro' the door, 'cos that was locked; an' 'e 'adn't come thro' the window, 'cos that was shut an' barred; an' yet there e' was, sittin' in the chair, calling 'Jenky, Jenky, Jenky!' an' 'Jenky, Jenky, Jenky!' Then Jenkyns blew into the candle agen, an' the dim blue light went away, an' the candle burned clear, an' lo an' behold! that little grey old man was vanished.

"'There!' says Jenkyns; but me brothers didn't wait to hear any more; they just took to their heels an' set off home as if the Old Man were after them, leavin' me to follow as best I could. But I believe to this day 'twas the Old Gentleman himself as we saw."

I asked her what had become of the big book, and what was in it, but she did not know, though she thought that the books were left to a nephew who had disappeared. She did not know the contents of them either, but said that "the Bible was a great book with him!" I had no time to ask any more questions, for Mrs. Pryce was launched on another story.

"One day there was a young man goin' to Monmouth races, an' as 'e was passin' 'is field, 'e see'd the cattle 'atin' of 'is crops. So 'e up an' took 'is jacket off an' throwed it over the gate, an druv' 'em off; but when 'e come back 'is jacket was gone. Now there was an 'ooman round there as 'e knowed 'ud take anything, but o' course 'e 'oodn't miss the Monmouth races, an' so 'e went without 'is jacket. But when 'e came back 'e told 'is wife, an' she told 'im to go off to old Jenkyns an' 'e'd get it back for 'im. Well, old Jenkyns 'e said, 'That 'ooman wont rest till she come an' put your coat back on the gate where she took'd it from. But what'll I do to punish 'er?'

"'Oh!' said the young man, 'don't do anything to hurt her, so long as I gets me jacket back.'

"'Well,' says the old Jenkyns, ' 'ow 'ud it be if I was to put the button 'ole on her cheek, just 'ere, under 'er eye?'

"'All right,' says the young man.

"An', sure enough, that 'ooman come'd n' put back that jacket on the gate, where she tooked it from; but ever arterwards she 'ad the mark of a black button-hole on 'er cheek, just beside 'er eye, so as everyone should know what sort of an 'ooman she was."

"But have you seen the mark, Mrs. Pryce?" I said.

"Why yes, me dear," said Mrs, Pryce, "t'was old So-and-so;" and with that she gave me her whole pedigree. "An' many a time have I seen that mark," said she. "Oh, Jenkyns always punished people when they stole things; there was those folk down to Pen-y-van, they had a bad time of it, I'll tell you about that. There was a farmer down by Pen-y-van, an' 'e 'ad a lot o' cider, but that all got stolen by four people. So 'e went to old Jenkyns to see what was to be done. But ole Jenkyns, 'Tisn't no good,' says he, 'the cider's drinked; I can't get it back for you, 'cos it's all drinked; but I'll tell you what I'll do,' says 'e; 'you come along to the green at six o'clock to-morrer evening, an' I'll make 'em dance;' an' sure enough he coom'd, an' there was these four people dancin' away on the green, men an' women. An' they couldn't help it, 'cos old Jenkyns 'ad put a spell on them, an' they danced for two hours for punishment, till 'e tooked the spell off. An' there was hundreds o' people watchin' 'em. Old Ann Griffiths, she told me all about it, how they was dancin' and jumpin' about, an' all the time ready to drop. Old Jenkyns, 'e was a watchin' quite pleased like for some time; then 'e got tired, tooked the spell off an' went home."

"An' it's not the first time 'e's punished people like that," said Mrs. Briton. "Don't you remember that 'ooman at the public down to Grosmont?" and she started on her story, Mrs. Pryce now and then putting in a nod of approval

"One day old Jenk3ms was going down town, an' 'e stopped at a public, 'The Cock and Feather,' to get some refreshment 'E asked for bread an' cheese an' beer; when 'e'd finished 'e asked 'ow much it was. 'Oh,' says the landlady, 'lef s see, six an' four's ten, that's tenpence, please.' Jenkyns said, 'twas too much, but 'e paid 'is tenpence an' went off.

"Presently the 'ooman came back into the room an' went up to the place where Jenkyns had been sitting, an' calls out,

"Six an' four's ten.  
Here's off agen.'

"An' she started runnin' round the table, an' when she came back to Jenkyns' place she called out again,

"'Six an' four's ten.  
Here's off agan.'

"An' started ninnin' round agen. Presently 'er daughter came in an' seed 'er mother runnin' round the table an' callin' out, so she knowed she'd got a spell on 'er. She went on like that for an hour and a half, then 'er son came back from work an' see'd 'is mother runnin' round the table, callin' out,

"Six an' four's ten.  
Here's off agen.'

"So 'e said, "Why, mother, what's t' matter?'"

An' she says, 'Oh, I don't know!

"'Six an' four's ten,  
Here's off" agen.'

"So 'e said to 'is sister, ''As so-an'-so been 'ere?' an' she said 'e 'ad, an' 'e said, ''Ow long's 'e been gone?' an' she said, 'Two hour.'

"So 'e went an' caught up old Jenkyns an' tells 'im what was wrong, an' Jenkyns says, 'Serve 'er right for chaigin' a poor man tenpence for a bit o' bread an' cheese. But,' 'e says, 'you go an' look under a candlestick on your mantelpiece; there youll see a bit of paper. Don't you look at it or it'll be the worse for you, but throw it in the fire. An' I hope this'll be a lesson to yer mother.'

"So the son went home, an' there was 'is mother, still runnin' round an' calling out,

"Six an' four's ten,  
Here's off" agen.'

"'E ran to the chimney-piece, there was the paper! an' 'e throwed it in the fire; 'is mother dropped into a chair, all exhausted like. An' it served 'er right."

Mrs. Briton stopped, quite exhausted, for she had been acting the story herself all the time, rushing round the table and shouting,

"Six an' four's ten,  
Here's off agen."

Mrs. Pryce and I were simply screaming with laughter, and it was some time before Mrs. Pryce went on, with a rather disjointed story about a witch:

"One day some folk came to old Jenkyns about a witch; they told 'im 'ow she used to turn herself into a hare an' stand on an old gate-post an' frighten folk terrible. Once there was some men goin' by an' they see'd 'er on the post, an' she called out

"Pee wow, pee wow!' and jumped down; an' they all runned away. So old Jenkyns he says, *You follow after her,' says 'e, 'an' stick a knife into 'er *third 'eel-mark*, then you'll be rid of her.' Now this old witch had put a spell on a woman in the village, so 'er husband an' 'er brother said they'd pay 'er out.

"They see'd the old lady goin' along the road one day, an' so in the third heel-mark from where she was they stuck a knife into the ground. She set up such a screechin' you could a' heard it for miles. 'Oo told you to do that' says she, an' begins sayin' things most awful. Then she went off limpin' like, as if a knife was put right thro' 'er foot So you see old Jenkyns 'e knew 'ow to settle witches, 'e did. Twas a pity he never see'd them on the Buckle. I'll tell you about them.

"One day there was a man going down the Buckle pitch, an' as 'e was goin' along, all of a sudden 'e 'eard sumthin' a comin' down behind 'im, an' 'e looked an' there 'e saw an old 'ooman a comin' gallopin' down the pitch on a piece of an old hurdle. She come right past 'im, an' 'e tried to catch hold of the hurdle; but no, 'e couldn't touch it, nohow. Then there came along another old hag, leppin' an' gallopin' on a ladder, an' behind her came another, as I'm alive, trundlin' on a common grindstone! They came right past 'im, an' on to a public beyond the pitch, an' there they stopped, an' them that wasn't too frightened tried to shoot 'em, but no, nothing couldn't touch 'em, nobody could catch hold of that hurdle, nor the ladder, nor the grindstone neither; an' presently they called, 'Pee wow. Pee wow!' 'an' was off again, so as nobody couldn't stop 'em."

"Well, now I'd like to have seen that," said Mrs. Briton. "I expect you'll be practising on one o' them old grindstones, won't you, to see if you can get along same as the witches? "

"Talkin' of witches," said Mrs. Pryce, "there was a wise woman way over the mountains some time ago, as I heard tell of. She could find anything that were lost. One day there was a man that had a very fine watch, an' 'e put it on the table one day while 'e went to clean 'isself, an' when 'e come back 'twas gone. So 'is mother went off 'way over the mountains to this old 'ooman. Jes' as she came up to the door a little dog run out barking. Then there came out a little, little old 'ooman. 'Don't you be afraid o' the dog,' says she; 'I know what you's come about. Twas your own niece as took the watch. You go back 'ome an' look under the stone next the pump in your scullery, an' there youll find it,' says she. 'An' will you have 'er that took it punished?' said she. But the 'ooman thanked her, and said so long as she got the watch back, she didn't care to punish any one, much less her own niece. So she went back, an' there sure 'nough she found the watch under a stone in the scullery. Now, weren't that strange, as the old 'ooman who'd never seen the place should know where the thing was?"

This was the last story Mrs. Pryce told me. Mrs. Briton, however, remembered some more about Jenkyns, and one day, when I was mangling for her, she told me the following:

"One day old Jenkyns was comin' up from Monmouth, and just on the pitch by the station was four horses strugglin' an' strainin' to drag a great piece of timber up the hill. They were pullin' an' men were pushin', an' then they'd be pulled back by the weight of it Jenkyns, he looked at them for some time, then he up an' shouts, 'Unhitch that fore horse!' So they unhitched him, 'cos nobody dared disobey anything that Jenkyns told them to do. 'Now hitch 'im on behind,' 'e said ; an' so they hitched 'im on behind. Then Jenkyns tooked the whip, cracked it, an' shouted, ' Now, me lads, all together!' An' would you believe it, them 'orses that couldn't move a step before, galloped up the hill like a top spinnin', an' the leader dancin' behind!"

Another day I cornered Mrs. Briton in the dairy, and bargained for a story. "Well," she said, "I'll tell you what I know 'bout old Sarah Griffiths. They used to say she was a witch, an' this was told me by old Jacob Jones 'isself, an' 'e ought to know. So if it's a lie, it's 'is own lie.

"It 'appened when Mr. Mason was livin' at the Argoed. 'Is gardener was very particler 'bout havin' turf from the 'ill, an' they 'ad ter bring it across the river in boats, an' old Tom Griffiths an' Jacob Jones, they was 'elpin'. Well, on the last day, when they'd got it all up, Mr. Mason's gardener, 'e left some money down at the Boat Inn, so as they should 'ave some beer, 'cause 'e was pleased they'd brought the turf up so quick. So Tom, when 'e went up to tea, 'e says to Sarah, 'e was goin' down for an hour, cos they was goin' to 'ave some singin' down at the 'Boat'; but Sarah, she said, 'Thee shassent go down theer; thee'st better stay at 'ome 'an 'ave thee's supper.'

"Well, Tom, 'e would'nt sUy, so she said, 'If thee goes down theer, thee bis'nt comin' 'ome to-night' An' she began to curse an' swear, an' say she wished the devil 'ud run off with 'im if 'e went down, but still 'e went.

"Well, 'e was a comin' up again, about ten, with old Jacob Jones, an' Jacob was a little way in front; 'e was a tellin' me about it arterwards. 'E said, 'It's as true as my hand's there,' 'e said, 'I felt myself goin' up, up, an' it took me breath away, it was so swift, an' I went up right over the hedge.' It were one of those 'igh 'edges all over dog-briars an' blackberry branches. An' 'e went right over, sheer down into the meadow the other side. Presently 'e 'eard some 'un swearin' close by, an' 'e said, 'Tom, is that thee? What f devil art doin' theer? 'An' Tom said, 'Jacob is that thee? What t' devil art doin' heer?'

"An' then they tried to get out, but they couldn't, an' they was all scrat about, an' bruised, an' cut, an' try as they might they couldn't get out, they was so buried in briars an' brambles. They lay there swearin' an' talkin' to one another till half-past five in the mornin', when they 'eard Dan an' Tom, their two boys, comin' up home from the dnworks. Then Jacob 'e called out 'Lor' bless thee, Dan, is that thee? Coom an' get us out o' this!'

"An' them two boys 'ad the greatest difficulty in gettin' 'em out, they was so stuck in them briars an' things. But at last they got out, an' when they got 'ome, there was old Sally boilin' the kettle, an' she said, 'I telled thee, Tom, thee oosn't come 'ome, an' thee didn't'

"There's another story I've just remembered about a witch," said Mrs. Briton; "I'll just tell you about it.

"There was an old witch used to live 'bout here, an' she had a daughter. Now there was a young man very fond of this girl, and wanting to marry her, but her mother hated him, and would have liked to have put him out of the way if she could.

"One day he came up to see his sweetheart, and there was her mother a brewin' somethin' in a saucepan on the fire. She says, 'Tom, do 'ee take t' kettle an' bring me some water from the well.' But the girl called out, 'Don't 'ee go, Tom. Oh! don't 'ee go.' 'You be quiet, ye interfering hussy,' says the old 'ooman. 'Here, Tom, take t' kettle.'

"So Tom took the kettle an' went off to the well, an' dipped it in; but 'e felt somethin' a pullin' an' pushin' him till it got 'is 'ead right under water as 'twere tryin' to drown him. O' course 'e struggled and kicked till 'e got 'is 'ead up again, an' then 'e looked round to see who 'twere, but there — there war'nt no one.

"'E couldn't see no one, but in two minutes somethin' had 'im again and got 'im under the water, an' all this time 'e couldn't get the kettle filled anyway. Three times 'e were took an' dipped in the well, an' it were a wonder 'e weren't drowned, for 'twas all 'e could do to keep 'is 'ead up. At last 'e got the kettle filled an' went back to the cottage.

"There was the old 'ooman still brewin' in the saucepan an' mutterin' to herself; but when she saw 'im that she thought was drowned come to the door with the kettle full she stopped all of a sudden an' looked at 'im that awful, an' a sort of a horrid laugh came out of the saucepan, an' the lid jumped off an' flew right up the chimney so as all the kitchen was filled with smoke an' the most awful smell. Then 'e knowed she 'ad been brewin' spells to kill 'im, so 'e dropped the kettle an' took to 'is 'eels, an' all up the road 'e could 'ear 'er cursin' 'im, an' I take it 'e was glad to get 'ome. But 'e never went after that girl agen."

Mrs. Briton is one of the few people from whom you can get ghost stories first hand; they are rather vague, but she believes in them implicitly.

"One day," she said, "our cattle got lost an' our two boys went out to look for them. They was out for hours an' hours, an' towards evening Bill Roberts brought the cattle home, but 'e 'adn't seen them boys. So I began to get anxious like, an' I went out all over the place huntin' an' callin' for them. At last it got quite dark, an' I was in an awful state o' mind: I put a lamp in the window to guide them if they was to come back, an' went out with my father to look for them again. We was just goin' past the house of a wicked, wicked old man what had just died (they told all kinds of stories about him, some said as 'e had killed 'is own wife); as I was sayin' we was passin' this house, an' I saw just beside me a big, big, black dog, as large as a calf, an' 'is eyes shone like lumps of fire. My father hit at it with 'is stick, an', would you believe me, the stick went right through it, an' 'twas still there!

"Bye-an'-bye, when we'd passed the house, the dog disappeared.

"'That's a sure token,' says my father, 'that them boys is in the river!'

"Well, you may believe that made me feel bad, but when we got 'ome the lamp was gone out of the window, an' I rushed upstairs, there was the boys fast asleep. Next momin' they told me how they'd got so tired an' gone to sleep in the road, an' woken up when it was dark an' come on home. But that day a telegram come to say as my brother 'ad been killed by a railway truck. So, you see, it was an omen, seeing that there dog."

There is a funny old house on the way to Penallt called the "Potash"; it is said to be haunted, but Mrs. Briton is the only person I have met who has seen anything there. This is her account:

"One night about twelve o'clock I was goin' along the road down to Mitchel Troy, where we used to live; I was just nearin' the 'Potash' when I heard like a lot of people talkin' in the air. First I thought 'twas the gypsies, but as I was comin' by the hedge in the field I saw a sort of a black cloud comin' thro' the gap, an' I heard a sound of dankin' chains, but all at once I knowed it wasn't gypsies 'cos they weren't there, an' I heard voices all around. I ran, an' ran, I was so frightened, till at last I fell right into a sand pit at the bottom of the hill."

Some other members of Mrs. Briton's family have seen visions too. Her son, Samuel, told me that one night, goin' up through Troy Woods, he had seen a great black beast with flaming eyes, and when he turned his lantern on it, it vanished with a sort of screech into a ditch.

Mr. Briton is said by his wife to have seen a black dog going nine times round a tree; I don't know if that is true, but after much cross-questioning, and with additions from Mrs. Briton, I made out that he really had seen something one night, when going to see his wife, who was nursing a sick woman in a him some way off. By the side of the road he saw a lady, dressed in a very old-fashioned way, holding her skirt up; her hair, of a sandy colour, was divided and arranged in two knots on the top of her head. Though it was a pitch-dark night he saw her plainly, and said "Good night;" but she passed him without speaking, and vanished up the road. Mr. Briton riished into the farm where his wife was, and told her be had seen the devil.

"Had 'e got a tail?" said she, laughing.

"No, but 'e had horns," he said; for he thought she had, from the way her hair was arranged.

"You should have followed her, and she'd have shown you a treasure if you'd asked her in God's name what she wanted," said Mrs. Briton sagely; and he wished he had.

"But, why did you think she was the devil?" I asked him. "Oh, I s'pose 'twas just a wicked thought of mine," he said.

I gathered some stories from Mrs. Briton about a mythical person, supposed to have come from Kentchurch `[TH: near Grosmont]` near by, who went by the name of Jack Kent. He is associated with the Druidical stones at Trelleck, and the cleft on the Skyrrid.

"They say that when Jacky was a little boy he made a compact with the devil, which enabled him to do anything he set his hand to.

"Once he was engaged by a farmer to scare crows; but there was a fair going on in the town, and Jack didn't mean to miss it, so he called all the crows together from all the fields round, and when they were all collected he sent them into an old barn, with no roof to it. But Jack put the crows in there and said something to them, and they couldn't get out, try as they might So Jack, he went to the fair, but when he had been enjoying himself there a bit, he met his master. (Now his master had specially told him he was not to go to the fair, or else the crows would be after the crops.) So the farmer said, 'Hullo, Jack, what art doin' here? Didn't I tell thee to look after th' crows?' But Jack says, 'T' crows be all right, master.' And he took the farmer to the old barn, and sure enough there was the crows, and they couldn't get out, altho' that barn had no roof, until Jack told them to. `[Cf. Folklore Journal, i., 370 [TH: actually, 379] (where Kent is misprinted Rent); also vol. ii., p. 10, and F. Hindes Groome's In Gipsy Tents (Nimmo), p. 11, whose version of the story has been heard in Shropshire also. — Ed.]`

"Jack bested the devil in everything. One day they were walking through a turnip-field, and Jack made a bet that he could get more profit out of the field, if they shared it, than the devil could. (The turnips weren't above ground then, but Jack knew they were there.) Jack asked the Old Boy if he'd have Tops or Bottoms. He said 'Tops,' so Jack got the turnips and the Old Boy the greens.

"Next year the Devil took the bet again, an' this time he made sure he'd win, so he said he'd have Bottoms; but Jack, be had took precautions, an' that field came up wheat, so he got the corn an' straw, an' the Devil got the roots, which of course wasn't much good.

"Then they went to threshing. Jack was to have Bottoms this time, so he got the barn floor, and the Devil went on top; so he put up a hurdle for the Devil to thresh on, and as he battered away Jack had all the corn on the floor.

"Then they made a bargain that Jack was to build a bridge over Trothy Weir, Grosmont, before the cock crowed in the morning, but Jack did not before the cock crowed, and there the stones lie to this day, many a ton.

"Jack did some wonderful things in his time. Why! one day he jumped off the Sugar Loaf Mountain on to the Skyrrid (and there's his heel-mark in the Skyrrid to this day). An' when he got there he began playing quoits, he pecked (threw) three stones as far as Trelleck, great, big ones, as tall as three men (and there they still stand in a field), and he threw another, but that didn't go quite far enough, and it lay on the Trelleck Road, just behind the five trees, till a little while ago, when it was moved so as the field might be ploughed; and this stone, in memory of Jack, was always called the Pecked Stone.

"The Devil swore he'd have Jack's soul whether he were buried inside or outside the church; but when Jack died he was buried just under the wall of Grosmont Church, with his head inside and his legs outside, and a great stone (which has since been moved) was put to mark the place. So the Devil never got him."

In Monmouthshire there is a curious custom called "New Year's Gifts." On New Year's Eve the village children bring round apples, with three sticks for legs, and surmounted by a sprig of box adomed with hazel-nuts, fastened on by slitting the nut at the top and inserting a leaf of the sprig. I have heard, too, that in the spring, when the crops are just beginning to sprout, the men go into the field, taking cider with them, light a fire, and "say something" over the corn. On Good Friday it is right to bake a small loaf, which is to be kept till the same date next year; it will not go bad. Some of this loaf ground up is a certain cure for various illnesses.

Mrs. Briton says that if you kill an adder, and before sundown hold it over a flame of fire, its four legs will come out. She has seen it!

[John of Kent]

Grosmont is now a small and neat village; but was once a place of considerable importance, and is still governed by a mayor and burgesses. The natives boast of its former extent, point out spots at some distance which formed streets of the town, and allude to a tradition, that the market was once held on the side of the Graig. But a more decisive proof of its former importance is derived from the numerous causeways, which diverge from it in several directions, and which in any other county should have conceived to be remains of Roman roads. Two of these causeways may be traced to the distance of a mile, one leading towards the Graig and the Abergavenny road, and the other, towards the extremity of the village, in the direction of Scenfreth and Monmouth, which is supposed by the natives to have been a street of the town. These roads are raised to the height of several feet, and though much dilapidated, are still in many places from nine to twelve feet broad; the stones are laid one on the other, several which I measured were not less than nine feet in length, and of proportionate breadth and thickness. Within the memory of the inhabitants, roads of a similar construction led in other directions, but have been demolishied for the sake of the materials.

As Newcastle teems with tales of sprites and elves, so Grosmont rings with the achievements of John of Kent, whose exploits almost eclipse the adventures of baron Munkhausen. Old and young women, men and boys, unite in relating with extreme volubility, and without the smallest disagreement, a series of extraordinary tales concerning this wonderful personage. Like Dr. Faustus, he is faid to have made a compact with the devil; but more successful than the doctor, he evaded the conditions of his covenant, and outwitted the prince of darkness, both in his life and at his death.

Among the early specimens of his magical skill, while a farmer's boy in the vicinity, he confined a number of crows, which he was ordered to keep from the

[image Grosmont Castle]

corn, in an old barn without a roof, that he might visit Grosmont fair. "And sure enough," said the old woman, who told me the anecdote, "they were there; for they made a terrible clatter, and would not fly away till Jack himself came and released them."

Kentchurch House, the neighbouring seat of the Scudamore family, by whom he was hired as a servant, became afterwards the scene of his marvellous exploits, which it would be tedious to recount. But the feat of all others, which most endears his memory to the inhabitants of Grosmont, was the construction of the bridge over the Monnow, leading to Kentchurch; it is still called John of Kent's bridge, and is said to have been built in one night by one of his familiar spirits. "But it could not be the devil, sir," added the relater of the tale, "for he would never have done so good an action."

An old tombstone in the church yard, close to the east wall of the chancel, is said to cover his body, and the legend reports, that he was interred under the wall to evade the condition of his compact which stipulated, that if buried either within the church, or out of the church, he should become the property of Satan. At the time of both my visits to Grosmont, this tomb was covered with a quantity of rubbish, which prevented me from inspecting it; but I was informed by the clerk, and by many other persons, that it contained no inscription.

A cellar at Kentchurch house is still shewn as the stable where he kept horse, on which he traversed the air with the speed of Lapland witches; and his portrait on wood, painted in oil, of which an engraving is annexed, is likewise there preserved.

The family of Kentchurch, to whom I applied for the true character and actions of this reputed sorcerer, could afford no specific or positive information. According to tradition, he was a monk, educated at one of the universities, and remarkable for his learning; in an age of ignorance, his acquirements excited the astonishment of his contemporaries, and like friar Bacon he was esteemed by the vulgar a necromancer. A Latin translation of the Bible, on vellum, which was either made or copied by him, was preserved in the family, but has been long mifsaid or destroyed.

Various opinions have been entertained concerning this mysterious perfonage. According to fome he was the John of Kent, Gwent, or Went, a Franciscan, thus mentioned by Leland: "He was bred in Wales, and so ardently followed the most celebrated schools of the Franciscans at Oxford, and made such improvements in profound learning, that he was the wonder of all his religious brethren." According to the antiquities of the English Franciscans, he was born at Chepstow, became professor and doctor of divinity, and on account of his extraordinary virtue was chosen minister provincial of the order in England. He wrote many learned and pious works, particularly Commentaries on the Master of the Sentences, Sermons to the People, and Disputed Questions. He died in 1348; and the catalogue of the provincial ministers says of him, "Brother John Went, doctor of Oxford, who wrought miracles in his life time, lies at Hereford." Baker, in his Chronicle, mentions another John of Kent among the men of learning in the reign of Henry the third `[Leland, Scrip. Brit, p.376. Antiq. of the E. Francisc. p. 159. Baker's Chronicle, p. 132.]`.

According to others he was a bard of Owen Glendower, and became domesticated in the family on the defeat of his chieftain, whose daughter married a Scudamore.

A tradition however fhill prevails, that an old wizard, difgnlfed in a fliepherd's habit, once roamed about in the neighbourhood of Grofmont, frequented Kentchurch Houfe, and was buried privately under the Hone in the church yard,, below the eaft window of the chancel, which is called John of Kent's tombftone. A refpedtable perfon, long relident in the village of Kentchurch, from whom I derived this information, conjeflures that this wizard was Owen Glendower himfelf, who, when proferibed, wandered about in a (hepherd's habit, and took refuge with one of his daughters. It is likewife remarkable, that the 'place of Owen Glendower's death, or fepulture, has never been pofitively afeertained ; fome fuppofe, though without fufficient authority, that he was interred


[Image John of Kent]

at Mornington in Herefordshire, the feat of one of his sons in law, others, with still less probability, that he was buried in the cathedral of Bangor.

`[A curious passage from the Memoirs of Owen Glendower is here submitted to the reader, p. 73. "A. D. 1415, death put a period to Owen's life and misery upon the eve of St. Matthew. Some say he died at his daughter Scudamore's, others at his daughter Mornington's house. They had both harboured him in his forlorn condition. They say that he was fain to go up and down disguised in a shepherd's habit, to his daughters' and other friends' houses. Where Owen was buried cannot now be ascertained. But my countrymen, whether from tradition or conjecture, know not, suppose a grave under the great window in the fouth isle wall of Bangor cathedral, to be his place of interment. This mural monument is singular and much noticed; it lies within the wall, having a hollow arch over it, and a short buttress to support it. The stone, which is of the grit kind, has no inscription on it, or any adornment besides a large ill formed cross." "Humphrey, a late bishop of Bangor, and a great antiquary, did not credit this report, but firm;y believed, from a passage in Giraldus' Itinerary, that it was the mausoleum of Owen Gwynedd, prince of North Wales. A. D. 1138."

Though now an insignificant cluster of habitations, Grosmont was formerly a town of some note. Many exterior traces of buildings, and raised causeways, constructed like Roman roads with large blocks of stone, diverging from it, prove its antique extent and importance to have been considerable: nor is the legend of the place deficient in asserting its quondam consequence.

But with still higher interest, with more voluble earnestness, the natives recount the exploits of their reputed necromancer, John of Kent. Among a thousand other instances of his magical skill, they confidently assure you, that when he was a hoy, being ordered to protect some corn from the birds, he conjured all the crows in the neighbourhood into a barn without a roof, and by force of his incantations obliged them to remain there while he visited Grosmont fair. A greater service that he performed for the countrywas, his building the bridge over the Monnow in one night by the agency of one of his familiars. Long did his strange actions frighten men out of their wits; and at length, dying, he outwitted the devil; for, in consideration of services while living, he agreed to surrender himself to his satanic majesty after his death, whether he was buried in or out of church; but, by ordering his body to be interred under the church wall, he contrived to slip out of the contract. A stone in the church-yard, near the chancel, is said to mark the spot of this interment.

Higher tradition relates, that this extraordinary personage was a monk, who, possessing a greater knowledge in natural philosophy than could at that time be generally comprehended, was reputed a sorcerer. The family of the Scudamores, at Kentchurch-house, about a mile from Grosmont, where he became domesticated, had a Latin translation of the Bible written by him on vellum, but which is now lost. An ancient painting of him upon wood is, however, preserved in the mansion; and a cellar in the house is described to have been the stable of his horses; steeds of no vulgar pedigree, which carried him through the air with more than the speed of witches.

From a collation of different legends and circumstances, several respectable enquirers are inclined to believe, that this necromancer was no other than the famous Owen Glendower; who, after his defeat, and the dispersion of his army, concealed himself in the disguise of a bard, or wizard. A strong circumstance which favours this conjecture is, that the daughter of Glendower married a Scudamore, who at the time occupied Kentchurch-house. It may also be remarked, that neither the time of the chief's death, nor the place of his sepulture, were ever positively ascertained.

Upon our return to Monmouth from this excursion, we had the good fortune to fall into the company of Mr. Wathen of Hereford, the benefit of whose local information apd obliging assiduities has been felt by numerous tourists, as well as ourselves. This gentleman pointed out the most striking beauties of the Wye toward Ross; and of his directions we gladly availed ourselves the following morning, when we bade adieu to Wales and Monmouthshire. But, as it is my object to effect a general delineation of that tract of country, I shall not hesitate to break the thread of my tour, and suspend a description of the Wye's scenery and some further continuance of our route, while I traverse the north-western part of Monmouthshire, and the eastern frontier of South-Wales, which yet remains unexplored. In this part of my work, I must describe things as they appeared to me six years since, when I visited this portion of country in my return from a tour through the North of England and Wales, assisted by the best documents and observations that I have since been able to procure.

Monmouthshire Beacon - Saturday 10 November 1849

FOREST OF DEAN. Highway .Robbery.—On Monday the sth inat. James and Joseph Williams, two colliers of Cinderford, were taken before the magistrates at Newnham, charged with rubbing Mr. Vaughan, a farmer of Ruardean. It appeared from the evidence that Mr. Vaughan had been to Cinderford to receive some money for work which had been done his horses for the Cinderford Iron Works Company, and between the hours of three and four o’clock in the afternoon, as was crossing Ruardean Hill Inclosure, two men rushed from behind a bush, one of them took Mr. Vaughan by the collar with his left hand, and his right he held a pistol against Mr. Vaughan’s head, while the other man stood a short distance off with large stick in his hand. The man who was holding him by the collar then demanded his money, threatening the same time that if he did not give all up to them he would blow his brains out. Mr. Vaughan then took part of his money from his pocket and gave to him. The robber said hail more and must deliver it up, or else he would blow his bnuns out. Mr. Vaughan then gave up all bis money, which consisted of two notes of the Ross Bank, four sovereigns, one half-sovereign, and 10s. in silver; the man that held him by the collar then kicked him up, and both ran away. Information of the robbery was given to the police at Lydbrook, when P.C. Cook of that station immediately went in search of the rubbers, and after obtaining the assistance of Sergeant Banning of the Littledean station, he succeeded in taking into custody the two Williams’s, and with the aid of P.C. Thompson of the Littlcdeaa station, searched their houses, but could not find any of the money which could be identified. The men were then taken before Mr. Vaughan who once identified them as the two men who had robbed him; also identified some clothes which were found in their houses as being part of the dress they wore when they robbed him. The prisoners were both committed to Gloucester County Gaol for trial at the next assizes. At ISewnham Petty Sessions Monday the stb November, (before Sir M. H. C. Boevy, Bart., M. Colchester, Esq., and the Rev. Cappin,) Jaiiah Harris, of the parish of Wcstbury-on-Severn, labourer, was brought up in custody charged with having stolen from off the South Wales Railway Line, wheelbarrow, the property of Mr. Wm. Hlinkhorn of Gloucester.—lt appears from the evidence that information of the robbery was given to the police at Newnham on the 2nd inst, when Sergeant Brown and P.C. Broad at once proceeded search for the missing barrow, and after searching several gardens at Westbury, they succeeded in finding it in that belonging to the prisoner who was fully committed for trial at the next Gloucester Sessions. Manslaughter. —On the 6th November, inst., an inquest which had been adjourned from the 30th ult. was resumed at the Plough Inn, Longhopc, before J. Barnett. Esq., coroner, on the body of new born female infant It appears that on the first of October last, a single woman named Mary Ann Parry, the daughter of a farmer residing at Longhope, but who resided with another single woman named Caroline Hampton, at a small cottage in the village, delivered herself with the assistance of the girl Hampton while in bed, but from want of proper attendance and other causes, the infant died, and was kept concealed the house until the 24th October last, when the mother of the child, with her brother and his wife, took the child and buried it the parish meadow at Longhope. Information having reached the coroner, he ordered the body to be disinterred. The jury returned a verdict of Manslaughter against Mary Ann Parry and Caroh'ne Hampton, when they were both arrested under the coroner’s warrant by the police at Mitcheldean, and fully committed to Gloucester County Gaol for trial at the next Assizes.

FOREST OF DEAN. St. Bbiavbls.—An important improvement has been carried out in Briavels under, believe, the Government authorities of the Forest of Dean, which has added considerably to the appearance as well as to the salubrity of this interesting place. The unsightly and muddy moat or ditch which surrounded the old prison has been entirely removed, and the hanks have been sloped and planted with trees. When complete the place will ornament, instead of, as before, a disgrace to the place. Newnham Petty Sessions.—Monday.—(Before M. Colchester, Esq., and the Rev. D. Capper). William Hawkins and Michael Caragau, labourers, of the parish of Westbury, appeared to summonses cliarging them with assaulting Charles Thomas, a labourer, of the same place. It appears that on the night of the 29th ult, Thomas was sleeping in a hay loft at the Flat, when Hawkins and Caragan, with several other*,, went and dragged him out, and Hawkins beat him very, severely about the head. The bench convicted Hawkins in the sum of and ordered Caragan to pay all costs. 1 On Saturday last, labourer, named John Niblett, of Westbury-on-Sevem, was brought before J. Pyrke, Esq., at Littledcan, charged with stealing, from the Railway Inn, neckerchief, the property of Mr. Piper, the landlord of the inn. It appears that Niblett bail been drinking there on the morning of the robbery, and soon he had left the house the neck-tic was missing. Information of the robbery was forwarded to the police at Newnham, and Serjeant Brown, of that station, once proceeded in quest of Niblett, and succeeded in finding him Awre, and took him in custody, and on searching him at the Railway Inn, found the neckerchief. The prisoner was fully committed for trial at the next Gloucester sessions. Colefobd Petty Sessions.—Tuesday, 9th.^— (Before J. F. Brickdalc, E. Marhen, and E. O. Jones, Esquires).—Richard Hawkins, James Hawkins, Richard Powell, and James Howel, labourers, were brought up under a warrant charging them with assaulting, on the 29tb ult,, Edward Voice, farmer, residing at Whitehall, near Coleford. It appeared from the evidence that at 12 o’clock on the 29th of September last, the defendants entered a piece of land at the Lane End in the occupation of Mr. Voice, and which lie had bought and held peaceable possession of for upwards of three Years, when one of the defendants drevf the staple and removed the lock which was on the gate and put another on, and then turned over part of the soil. They afterwards turned Mr. Voice’s sheep out of the field and remained therein to keep possession, and on Mr. Voice going to put his shocp back in the field, they attacked him and forced him away from the gate, and threatened him if he should again attempt to enter; and from which threats Voice said he was in bodily fear. The defendants were bound over to keep the peace for three months. Francis Patten, of the parish of Ncwland, labourer, appeared to summons charging biro with assaulting Mary Bennett, of the same place. It appeared that on the 3rd of October inst. several angry words passed between the parties, when the defendant struck the complainant severe blow. The bench convicted the defendant, and ordered him to jiay fine of ss. and erpcnccs. Mr. E. Whifehouse, of Redbrook, ap|>eared to a summons charging him with neglecting and refusing to pay the sum of £3 18s. wages due to George Teague, collier. The bench made an order for the amount and expenses. On the night of the -Ith of October iust., or early the following morning, Higbfield House, near Lydncy, the resideni-e of John James, Esq., was burglariously attempted to be entered. It appears that the thieves removed the iron grating over the underground cellar window, and broke iron bar which was fixed lit the centre of the casement, but it is supposed they were disturbed in their operations P. C. Harrison of the Lydncy station, who was on duty in that port, and passed Mr. James’s home between the hours of one and two o’clock. The constable remained near the bouse for some time, and there can be no doubt but that the thieves must have seen or heard him, and left without their intended booty. We understand Mr. James has offered a large reward for the conviction of the offenders, and the police are Actively e ndeavouring to discover the marauders.

The morning was bright and gay as sun and cloudless sky could make it ; and when the ploughmen, with their teams, took the places which had been appointed them, and tho word " Forward ! " was given, it was as interesting a sight as could be imagined. As the eight noble horses of R. Sharpe, Esq., of Hewelsfield Court, entered the field doubt arose in the minds of some of their compeers as to their chance of success, but they soon became reanimated and henceforth emulation was the order of the day The! ploughing took place in a ley-field belonging to Mr? Benjamin Phelps, of Bodmore Farm, and every possible arrangement was made the committee and the officers of the club to carry out the day's proceedings with satisfaction to every one.

Worcestershire Chronicle - Wednesday 15 January 1840

EXTRAORDINARY CASE OF HIGHWAY ROBBERY, AND COLD-BLOODED ATTEMPT AT MURDER. Early on Sunday morning last, this city and neighbourhood were thrown into a state of the greatest excitement by the report that aman, who had left this city the previous night, had been murdered and robbed a few miles below Tewkesbury, on the road to Cheltenham, and strong suspicion attached to a young man who lately held a very respectable situation in a stationer’s shop in this city, and had always borne an unim- peachable character. From the circumstances detailed, little doubt seemed to exist that he was really the guilty party, but we are happy to state that all suspicion was removed by his appearance in this city on Monday last about twelve o'clock. On enquiry jnto the facts connected with this transaction we ascertained that a person named Yarworth, who isa stone getter, in the Forest of Dean, had been in this city for some few days previous to Saturday last, collecting his half-yearly accounts from the stene masons here, and receiving orders for future supplies. After finishing his business he returned to Mr. Thornes’, at the Angel Inn, where he had been stay- ing, with the intention of proceeding homewards by the way of Cheltenham, and on the arrival of the Wellington coach, which proceeds from this city to Bristol through Glou- cester, at Mr. Thornes’, Mr. Yarworth, with two other gentle- men, Mr. Pritchard and Mr. Sharp, got upon it. Nothing more was heard of the parties until about twelve o'clock that night, when an express arrived at our Police Station-house, from Martin, the Tewkesbury constable, stating shortly that Mr. Yarworth had been robbed and fired at twice, by a person whose description was forwarded, and who was supposed to have got upon the Mr. Thornes’. This description so far tallied with that of Mr, Pritchard, that the suspicions above mentioned seemed to leave little doubt of his guilt. Thus matters remained until about three on Sunday afternoon, when Mr, Thornes and a friend of Mr. Pritchard’s proceeded to the Pitt's Elm public-house, whither Mr. Yarworth had been removed, who, upon seeing Mr. ‘Thornes, stated that he was very glad he was come, and upon their inquiring as to Mr. Pritchard, Mr. Yarworth at once declared that he was not the person. Thus satisfied, Mr. Thornes, with Mr. Pritchard’s friend, proceeded to Cheltenham in hopes to meet him there. About twelve o’clock at night the Bristol mail arrived in this city, and many persons had assembled to ascertain if anything further was known. Horsley, the coach- man, stated that he had brought Mr. Pritchard by the coach to Tewkesbury, and had left him there, the mail being then full, so that he could not come on to Worcester; upon this intelligence some friends of Mr. Pritchard’s proceeded in a fly to Tewkesbury, where they found him about three o'clock in the morning in bed at the Anchor Inn. He immediately got up, and his friends informed him of the report in circulation, and advised his at once proceeding to see Mr. Yarworth, to which he readily assented, and the parties having ordered a second fly, proceeded to the Pitt's Elm public-house, called the Old White Swan ; where, after ascertaining that Mr. Yar- worth was sufficiently well and collected to see and identify any person, Mr. Pritchard was introduced, when he imme- diately said to Mr. Pritchard's friends, “ That is not the man, he is as innocent as you are.” This having perfectly satisfied them, Mr. Yarworth then stated the cireumstances attending the attack nearly as follows :— After leaving Mr. Thornes, some man got inside the coach, as the guard told him there was no room outside, but at what distance from Worcester.I can’t exactly say, though I think it was about three miles. Wecame on to Tewkesbury, where we all got off at the Bear Inn. After the coach had changed horses, Mr. Pritchard was left at Tewkesbury, and the man who was before inside got outside, and took the place Mr. Pritchard had occupied. While proceeding along the road, I said I should walk from Coombe Hill to Cheltenham, and the man said he was going to Cheltenham and would walk with me. When the coach arrived at Coombe Hill, we both got down. Lasked him if he would take a glass of ale; he said “ J should rather like a drop of gin.” We went into the public house, and [had a glass of ale and he had a glass of gin, put was told that it which I pulled out my money to pay for, was paid for by the other man. I said, “ T don’t want you to pay for me. and he said, “It is no matter between you and meé. We then set out to walk, and after proceeding about 400 yards, he pulled out a pistol, and shot me. I caught a glance of something, and turned a little round, and the bullet took my ear, and so round to the back of my neck, where itis now. I then put ont my right hand to seize him, but he instantly shot me through the thick part of my side, just under my arm. I fell. He then stood ovey me, and reloading the pistol, asked mé for my ‘money. I was unable ; I said I thou T said I could not give it him, ght he had shot me enough, aud implored him not to shoot me again. He then rifled my pockets, and took seven 5/. notes, twelve sovereigns, and nine shillings, a cheque for 5/., a bill at two months for 13/., drawn by me upon, and accepted by, Mr. Perkes, stonemason, and my watch. After he had done this, he turned to go away. I[ asked him not to leave me in the road, as the coaches would run over me. He turned back and said , “he was very sorry for having shot me, and that I ought to have given him my money.” He then dragged me from the middle to the side of the road, put on my hat, and left me, and went towards Coombe Hill. In about five minutes, I heard a person coming along the road, and him; he came to me, and I told him [ had been robbed and shot. The person said he could not ‘move me himself, but he would soon fetch assistance. He returned im time with two other persons, and I was conveyed to this house (the Pitt's Elm public-house.) While Mr. Yarworth was being removed, two gentlemen, who were proceeding from Cheltenham to ‘lewkesbury on horseback, happened to come up, and having ascertained what was pass- ing,one of them immediately dismounted, and, giving his horse to his friend to hold, rendered every assistance in conveying Mr. Yarworth to the Pitt's Elm public-honse; and, having ascertained the danger he was in, immediately prevailed upon his friend to let him have his horse, (his own being a three- year-old,) and at once set off to Tewkesbury for a surgeon, who very promptly attended, and rendered every assistance to the wounded man. Tco much praise cannot be bestowed on these gentlemen for the promptitude, alacrity, and willingness which they displayed, nor to the surgeons and others for the prompt assistance rendered by them. Mr. Yarworth’s description of the man who committed this horrible deed is as follows :—He stands about 5 feet 1] inches high, is of a sallow complexion, has dark hair, and was dressed in a dark coat, with gilt buttons, and dirty white trowsers, as he thought. Mr. Yarworth states that he could readily identify him, and the daughter of the landlord at the public-house at Coombe Hill states that she could swear to him, as she had a good opportunity of seeing him while drinking the gin; and no doubt many of the passengers on the Wellington could do the same. Mr. Pritchard’s friends deeming it advisable that he should appear as quickly as possible in Worcester, set out to return, and arrived in this city about 12 o'clock, and im- mediately proceeded with him to the Magistrates’ office, where a full Bench was assembled, and Mr. Pritchard stated the cir- cumstances of the case, as far as he was personally acquainted with them, which were in substance as follows :—That before arriving at Tewkesbury, Mr. Yarworth said he should walk to Cheltenham from the turn at Coombe Hill, and asked Mr. Pritchard, who had told Mr. Yarworth that he was also going to Cheltenham, if he would walk with him; that he (Mr. P.) replied he would see all walking at the devil while he could ride; that when the coach arrived at Tewkesbury he got down at the Bear Inn, and knowing that the Paul Pry coach would be in Tewkesbury in an hour, he Walked into the Anchor Inn, where he stayed until the Pry coach came up, and pro- ceeded by it to Cheltenham ; that as the coach passed the Elm a man standing in the road with others hallooed to the coachman, and asked if he had passed any one on the road, as a man had been shot and robbed. The coach- man drove on, and he said to him “Tf should think that is all nonsense—a man being shot so early in the evening as this” (it was then about seven and the coachman said, “ I dare say they only wanted me to pull up, that they might have aride ; but they seemed a queerish lot, and I was not going to do it. Mr. Pritchard then stated that on the Sunday morning he happened to go into the Wellington public-honse at Chel- tenham, and heard some persons talking there about the shooting and robbery of a person who came from Worcester by the Wellington coach; upon which he said, “Why [I left Worcester by the Wellington coach last evening, and I know nothing of it.” On this one of the persons left the house, and after he (Mr. P.) had enquired of the landlady where Mr. Holmes, a coachman, lived, he walked down the street. While so walking, a policeman came up to him and said “I beg your pardon, Sir, but I’m informed you were a passenger by the Wellington coach from Worcester yesterday Mr. Pritchard replied, “I was.” The policeman then asked him if he knew anything of the robbery and shooting, and he mentioned what had passed at the Elm public-house, with the impression the observations made by the coachman had left upon his mind. The policeman then asked him if he had any objection to go to the Station-house and tell all he knew about it. Mr. P. said certainly not. He then went with the policeman, and told him of the number of passengers, and who got up, as nearly as be could recollect. He then left the Station-house, leaving his address in Worcester, and, instead of going on to Cirencester to see a friend as he in- tended, walked to Gloucester for the purpose of returning to Worcester by the mail, thinking he might be wanted to give information on the subject. That he rode by the Gloucester mail to Tewkesbury, and went again to the Anchor Inn, but finding that the mail when it came up was full with booked pas- sengers, he determined to stay till the morning, and come on by L’Hirondelle coach, which arrives in Worcester about eight o'clock. Mr. Pritchard then detailed the arrival of his friends about three and the other facts, of which our readers are in possession. The Magistrates expressed themselves fully satisfied with Mr. Pritchard’s explanation, and regretted exceedingly that circumstances should have placed him for one moment under suspicion. Mr. Pritchard thanked the Magistrates for the kindness allowed him in giving that public explanation, and left the office to receive the warm congratulations of his friends. Tn connexion with this subject, it transpired before the Magistrates, that a man auswering very nearly to the de- scription given by Mr. Yarworth, and another man were taken into custody by policeman Jones, No. 11, of this city, at the Albion public-house, in the Gloucester-road, about four on Saturday last, on a charge of house-breaking at Cheltenham, intelligence of which had been forwarded to the police here,and that while Jones was securing his companion, the man above-mentioned escaped, and ran towards Mr. Allies’s Jones immediately pursued him, and was gaining upon him, when the man turned round, presented a pistol at him, and said if he followed him any further, he would shoot him dead. Jones drew back a little, and the man ran on, Jones still following him, when the man made a dead stand, and presenting a pistol in each hand, again repeated the threat. Jones, upon this, became alarmed for his personal safety, and allowed him to get off. The Magistrates, upon Jones’s expla- nation of this circumstance, informed him that they thought he ought to have kept his eye upon the man, though at such a distance as not to endanger his personal safety, until, as was probable, (it being market day,) some horsemen or others might have come up. But Jones stated the man seemed really so determined, that he had.no doubt he would have car- ried his threat into execution ; and, we ave no-doubt, our readers will be of the same opinion. We have ascertained that the Wellington coach passed along the road in about twenty minutes after this, and, supposing Mr. Yarworth to be correct in stating that some person got inside the coach, within three miles of Worcester, and that the person who so got inside the coach was the person who shot and afterwards robbed him, little reasonable doubt can, we think, be entertained that this was the very man who escaped from Jones. The Magistrates immediately directed that Jones’s description, which corres- ponded in the main with Mr. Yarworth’s, should be forwarded to Birmingham, whither it was supposed the villain had pro- ceeded, and that all diligence should be used by the police of our city, one of which body (Phillips) had been to Cheltenham and other places on the search; we understand at present without success. It must strike our readers that a case of so daring and bold a nature as the present has scarcely occurred since the days of Turpin and Sheppard, and they can scarcely fail to perceive that the person, whoever he may be, must be a professional villain ; as the boldness and coolness shewn on the occasion could, we should imagine, only be displayed by a practised hand. The dragging the half-murdered man out of the road, and the braggart sorrow expressed for the offence, are ample proofs of this. Itis surmised that the villain, within a quarter of an hour of the commission of the crime, must have returned to this city by the Red Rover coach, a person answering his description having got upon that coach near to Coombe Hill. Whither his intended destination was, will only be ascertained when justice shall have yielded up her victim to the outraged and offended laws uf his country, which we have to express our anxious hope will be ere that it may be long ere this country shall be again overrun with such a set of demons as unhappily overran it in the days of our forefathers. The introduction of the Rural Police force will we trust entirely rid us from such scourges and pests of society as those of the class above referred to. Of Mr. Pritchard, it is only necessary to observe that his conduct and character stand clear and far above suspicion, and we can only add our regret to that of numbers beside, that a state of circumstances should have been presented to the publi¢ mind, which left those immediately connected with him, by the ties of friendship, to assign no other reason for acquiescing in the public opinion than insanity; but, in these eases, “ when loud rumour speaks,” frail man will sometimes endure the common lot of humanity, inseparable from his nature, the whisper of suspicion, Since the above was we have learned that the coach- man of the Berkeley Hunt, from Cheltenham to London, picked up an individualexactly answering the description given of the perpetrator of this horrid deed, a short distance out. of Chel- tenham, on the Oxford-road. That he should have got upon the Red Rover coach and returned to this city, is, we find highly improbable, as the man at the turnpike-gate, near to which the robbery was committed, states that he heard the report of the pistols about three minutes after that coach had passed through on its road to Worcester; and, no doubt, the villain chose the opportune moment when he conceived the passengers had got out of hearing, to make hisdaring attempt. Mr. Yarworth, we are happy to learn, is better, one of the balls having been suc- cessfully extracted, and hopes are confidently entertained of his ultimate recovery.

HIGHWAY ROBBERY and ATTEMPT at MURDER (From the Cheltenham Free Press.) Never have we had to record a more atrocious attempt at murder than the one which has caused so much excitement in this town (Cheltenham) and neighbourhood during the past week. The facts are as follow : — A person named Richard Yarworth, aged twenty-four, a quarryman, employed in the Forest of Dean, had been to Worcester for the purpose of collecting some money due to his father, who lives at Dean Pool, near Coleford. On Sa- turday evening he left Worcester by the Wellington coach, in company vvith two gentlemen, named Pritchard and Sharp. The following deposition of the sufferer was taken on Sun- day by D. L. St. Clair, Esq., one of the Cheltenham ma- gistrates : — " After leaving Mr. Thome's (the landlord of the Angel Inn) some man got inside the coach, as the guard told him there was no room outside ; but at what distance from Wor- cester I cannot exactly say, though I think it was about three miles. We came on to Tewkesbury, where we all got off at the Bear Inn. After the coach had changed horses Mr. Pritchard was left at Tewkesbury, and the man who before was inside got outside, and took the place Mr. Pritchard had occupied While proceeding along the road I said I should walk from Combe-hill to Cheltenham, and the man said he was gong to Cheltenham, and would walk with me. When the coach arrived at Combe-hill we got down. I asked him if he would take a glass of ale ; he said, ' I should rather like a drop of gin.' We went into the public-house, and I had a glass of ale and he had a glass of gin, which I pulled out my money to pay for, but was told that it was paid for by the other man. I said, ' I don't want you to pay for me ?? and he said, 'Itis no matter between you and me.' We then set out to walk, and after proceeding about 400 yards he pulled out a pistol and shot me. I caught a glance of something, and turned a little round, and the bullet took my ear, and so round to the back of my neck, where it is now. I then put out my right hand to seize him, but he in- stantly shot me through the thick part of my side, just under my arm. I fell. He then stood over me, and, reloading the pistol, asked me for my money. I said I could not give it him ; that I was unable. I said I thought he had shot me enough, and implored him not to shoot me again.

Kendal Mercury - Saturday 08 February 1840

HIGHWAY ROBBERY AND ATTEMPT AT MURDER. Never have we had to record more atrocious attempt at murder than the one which has caused so much excitement in the town of Cheltenham and its neighbourhood during the past week. The facts are as follows—A person named Richard Yarworth aged twenty four, a quarryman, employed in the forest of Dean, bad been to Worcester for the purpose of collecting aome money due to his father, who lives at Dean Pool, near Coleford. On Saturday evening he left Worcester the Wellington coach, in company with two gentlemen, named Pritehard and Sharp- The followiug deposition the sufferer was taken on Sunday by D. L. St. Clair, Esq.. one of the Cheltenham magistrates - " Afterleaving Mr. Thome's (the landlord of the Angel Inn) some man got inside the coach, as the guard told him there was no room outside; but at what distance from Worcester I cannot exactly say though 1 think it about three miles. We came to Tewkesbury, where we all got offat the Bear Inn. After the coach had changed horses Air. Pritchard was left at Tewkesbury and the man who before was inside got outside, and took the place Mr. Pritchard had occupied. While proceeding along the read 1 said 1 should walk from Combe-hill to Cheltenham, and the man said he was going to Cheltenham, and would walk with me. When the coach arrived at Combe-hill,we got down. 1 asked him if he would take a class of ale ? He said, should rather like a drop of gin.' We went into the public-house and I had a glass ale and he had a glass gin, which pulled out my money to pay for, but was told that it was paid for by the other man. i aaid,' I don,t want you to pay for me and he said, It is no matter between you and me.' We then set out to walk, and after proceeding about 400 yards he pulled pistol and shot me. I caught a glance of something, and turned a little round, and the bullet took my ear, and so round to the back of my neck, .where it is now. I then put out my hand to seize him, but he instantly shot mi through the thick psrt of my side, just under arm. I fell. He then stood over me, reloading the pistol, asked for my money. I aaid I could not give it him, that was unable. I said I thought he had shot me enough, and implored him not to shoot again. He tin rifled my pockets, and took seven £H notes, twelve soverigns, and uine shillings, a check for X - bill at two months for £, 13, drawn by upon, and accepted by, Mr. Parkea, stonemason' and my watch. After he had done this he turned to away. I asked him not to leave me in the road, the coaches would run over He turned back and said, 'he was very sorry for having shot me, and that ought to haae given him my money.' then dragged trom the middle the side of the road, put on my hat, and left me, and went towards Combe-hill. about Ave minutes heard person com tag along the road, and called to him t he came me, and I told him I had been robbed and root. The person said he coald not mote himself, but would toon fetch roe assistance. He teturned in time with two other persona, I was conveyed his house (the PiflTg public-house)." Two gentlemen were passiug at the time of hia being taken in one whom alighted and assisted, and the other rode Tewkesbury for a eurgeon, who attrndei very promptly. Mr \ eayt, far he recollects, the man who committed the daed standa about five feet height, is of complexion, hai dark hair, and bad dark coat wilh gilt button*, and dirty white trousers. On Tuesdsy after, noon the first bullet was extracted Mr Gregory, surgeon of Cheltenham, whore exertions hare been indefatigable. The second ball, which is supposed be lodged ini the lirer, has not yet been extracted. The is a little better, and Mr. Gregory now entertains some slight hopes of his recovery. We are glad hear that the robber has fallen into the hand* of justice. He was arrested on Wednesday at Briatol. and now is safe custody. The clothes ia supposed to hare worn the night of the robbery hare been found the pawnbroker's where he had pledged them, and provided himself with fresh habiliments. The young woman at the public-huuae Combe-hill, who supplied him with the glasa gin he drank before starting to walk Cheltenham with Mr. Yarwortb, haa positively identified him ; but the wounded man, who we regret to say, remains, in very dangerous state, was not in a condition to see the robber on Wednesday.
