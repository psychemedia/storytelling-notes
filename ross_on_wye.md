A Tale of the Forest of Dean

TO DO - check from clausde.ai

The Forest of Dean belongs to Her Most Gracious Majesty, and is situated in the western district of Gloucestershire. It is about twenty miles long, and ten broad. Its wealth consists in productive coal and iron mines, stone quarries, and majestic oaks. One portion of this forest, abutting on the Wye, abounds in woodland scenes of tranquil beauty; another portion, stretching to the Severn, is bolder, and, as the Guide Books would say, more romantic "in its features." It was near the Severn that I lived when the events occured around me which I intend to narrate.

For many years the Forest of Dean was grossly neglected; its timber was cut down and no young trees were planted to fill up the vacancies. This system was carried so far, that, in my father's young days, large portions of the country nominally forest were completely without trees. Upon such treeless portions, or wherever else they chose, the neighbouring farmers considered themselves perfectly entitled to encroach. Some had actually enclosed for themselves portions of the royal property, and built cottages thereon, into which no constable ever walked to inquire by what right this unauthorised squatting took place. Acres, by the hundred, of forest land, having been thus appropriated, the district swarmed with population. Any cottager possessing pigs or sheep, cattle or donkies, turned his dumb dependents out into the forest, where they found free commons in its grassy nooks, as freely and unhesitatingly as if their owners' rights were enrolled on parchment, and had been bought with lawful money.

The Government decided that a check should be put on these proceedings, and determined to enclose the forest. Discontent accordingly prevailed among the foresters. At the Speech House—in the centre of the forest, and from time immemorial the forum of the district—meetings were held. While foresters denounced the Government proceeding, Government proceeded with its work. Trespassing sheep and cattle were impounded; if any rash adventurer commenced the building of a cottage within the royal ground, its walls were "tumbled." The enclosures were completed, while the foresters bewailed, or threatened in the Speech House, with about as much chance of what the speakers were pleased to call "redress," as a vagrant has, when he threatens appeal against the decision of the magistrate.

Mrs Winifred Kear was among those who were affected by the Government proceedings. By profession she was an ash-burner—in other words, a humble manufacturer of alkali; a term, however, which she has never heard in her life. She cut down fern, burned it, and from the ashes, with the aid of water, kneaded a substance into little round balls, which she sold to the surrounding housewives, for the purpose of softening the water in their tubs on washingdays. Out of the ashes of a vast number of ferns, with frugality to aid her in her alchemy, she had extracted a few pieces of gold, and with those she had built a little cottage, enclosing round it a quite liberal allowance of the royal ground, which she had made into a garden. She had also bred some sheep of a small hardy breed, producing very fine wool—a breed, I believe, peculiar to our forest. She had also a cow, who was a member, in fact, of Winny's family, and was accustomed to come "but and ben," as inclination led her. Winny's cottage was built in accordance with the architectural design to which our forest cottages in general conform. It had four rooms, two on the ground-floor and two above for the main part, with a back-kitchen as appendix. There was no lack of gay flowers in the garden, and Winny had not omitted to lay the foundations of an orchard. A vine grew over the cottage wall, and there was a jessamine that climbed over the green wooden porch, but it was not Winny that planted that. At any rate, I do not think it was, for all the neighbours said that Winny was a witch. When I was a young and lusty man she was an old tottering creature—not the woman, I think, to plant jessamine about her door. Jack Prosser, her factotum, never planted it, I'm sure. He was a wild Orson of a fellow. Went about with his hairy chest exposed, and no hat on his shaggy penthouse; which could be distinguished only by its anatomical position as a head of hair. No storm ever wetted Jack Prosser to the scalp; and his thick dirty hands, I am quite sure, never could have planted jessamine. Mary Llewellyn planted it when she was an orphan child. Now she is the mother of a fine young man who attends medical lectures at University College, and comes home to the forest in vacation time, to turn his nose up at the ignorance of me, his father.

Mary lived in the time I tell you of, with Winny Kear, who was her mother's mother. Winny petted her preposterously. I did not think so then, but I do now. I frequently remark to Mrs Wyville, that if our little rogue had been taken from her grandmother in early life it would have been a great blessing to both of us. As a damsel, Mary was extremely pastoral. In the morning she arose, milked her cow, Truelove, and placed the milk in bright tin pans to cream. Then she led breakfast, went to pastoral duties to the sheep, returned home again, and then went to the well for water. At the well it was a daily accident that I should chance to meet her. Having quarrelled with me there, she would go home, tuck up her sleeves, and play at cook till dinner time. After dinner she would decorate herself and go to the next village, shopping, if she could find anything to want, and had any money left to buy it with. Then she came home, and spent the evening in sewing and knitting; or in dancing, when it was a gay time and dances were afoot. I suppose that is how forest maidens usually live.
Now, in the opinion of the foresters, Jack Prosser was an able man. These good people are exclusively known to one another by some nickname, and Jack Prosser's nickname was the "Counsellor." Winny Kear being a witch, it was fair to suppose her man a gifted person; therefore Jack Prosser was the forest counsellor, the village Hampden, and so on. The result of forest meetings came at length in the shape of a decision that the banks of the enclosures should be levelled, and the forest once again thrown open. Of this movement Mr Prosser was appointed leader.

On the 10th of May, 18—, Mr Prosser attempted to wash his face and hands, to the intense astonishment of Miss Llewellyn, before whom he appeared in a model condition, as she sat knitting under an apple-tree. There is no doubt whatever, now, that Jack chuckled, and scratched his head. Mr Prosser made a declaration of affection, in short; but his manner was so mysterious, his words were so unutterable, that although he left Miss Llewellyn under the impression that he had proposed himself her future husband, and that he had been accepted as such; the lady herself had not the smallest suspicion of the purport of his declaration. It was not, in fact, until Jack had gone off in a state of rapture, and until Mary began to reflect, that the idea of Jack's "intentions" entered her imagination. She resolved, however, to take an early opportunity of undeceiving him.


Now it was Whitsuntide, and Whitsuntide is the great holiday season in the Forest of Dean. A very pleasant season, too, it is for anybody living in a forest, when the trees put on their first fresh leaves, and the orchards are in blossom, and the hawthorn too; when birds are making up for their long silence, and the bees again are busy. In the Forest of Dean every hamlet has, at this season, its wake or village festival; and morris-dancing is the business of life. Every morris-dancer throws aside his coat and waistcoat, to display a shirt covered with party-coloured ribbons twisted into rosettes for him by his sweetheart. Happy the maid who has decked out her lover with the gayest finery; she loves to see her ribbons glorified. Then the dancers put themselves on feathers also, and hang bells about their knees. The foremost dancer wields a staff, on which are inscribed the initials of the district to which his morris belongs. Our dancing-ground was Blakeney Hill. That hill is green to the summit, and its sides are covered with cottage gardens, and were then gay and sweet with apple-blossom. From the top you see the Severn parted from you by narrow dells and orchards, with Blakeney village set in the rustic picture like a black-bird's egg in a green nest of moss. On the top of this hill is a level platform, where has been always held the Blakeney Hill wake. To this wake all the different forest districts used to send forth their sets of morris-dancers; each set had its own dancing-ground, and you might see twenty or thirty companies, of forty or more couples, all tripping it at one time merrily.

On the 10th of May, 18—, I walked with Mary Llewellyn to this wake, soon after her interview with Mr Prosser. Mary was very joyous; we wandered, I may say, scampered, to and fro; the distant fiddles and the tink'ing of the morris-bells possibly made me sentimental. I twisted some wild flowers into a true love-knot, and offered them to Miss Llewellyn; she blushed, and put the flowers in her bosom. I offered her my arm, on which she put her hand for the first time. My future fate as a domestic man was decided then; it was a happy one; and when we reached the dancing-ground I joined with Miss Llewellyn a jolly circle of morris-dancers and I believe we danced to the astonishment of all beholders; for we were both glad, and our heels were dancing.

Thereupon proceeded Mr. Prosser to claim Mary for a dance. Mary at first, and then followed a few words

of explanation, which begot no friendship towards me from Mr Jack. When we came home, Farmer Grimes solemnly warned me against "being too sweet upon Polly Llewellyn," because she was a witch's grandchild, and the old woman had caused his wagon to stick for two hours in a rut opposite her cottage. I pooh-poohed Father Grimes, who, consequently, considered me a doomed lad.

Two miles from Lydney rises a bold table-land called the Bailey; a wild, heath-like place, commanding fine views of the Severn, the neighbourhood of Park End, and the picturesque woodland church of St. Paul's. The Bailey itself looks wild and desolate; there you have holly-trees and furze-bushes; and there we had, in July 18—, a meeting of some thousand foresters. Every district of the forest had sent to the general muster a supply of men with spades and pickaxes; yea, verily, and some with swords and muskets, that gave no very military look to warriors in smock-frocks, velveteens, and hob-nailed shoes. Counsellor Prosser addressed the assembly. Farmer Grimes wanted to know whether they would throw the banks down, in case soldiers came? The resolution passed in answer to Farmer Grimes's query was to the effect, that if the soldiers—a regiment or so—did come, the banks were to be allowed to stand; but, if the military force were small, and the foresters could overcome it, the fences were to be demolished. The foresters then separated into several detachments, each under its leader, and each appointed to destroy a certain part of the embankments. The rattle of spades and pickaxes shortly resounded; the levelling of every bank was celebrated with cheers remorselessly noisy, and serious alarm spread through the surrounding country. It was reported that the forest was in complete insurrection; that men regularly drilled and armed possessed the almost inaccessible recesses; and that Robin Hood did nothing in comparison with what was to be expected from the men of Dean.

Having razed the embankments, the bold foresters turned loose their cattle upon the forbidden ground; formed an encampment upon a rough ridge, called Putnage; and sent round detachments to exact contributions from adjacent villages and farms. The alarmed neighbours paid the black-mail. The local authorities swore in a multitude of special constables, and sent to London for the military. Sure enough, down the soldiers came.

The forest army under General Jack Prosser looked like a gipsy camp. The moment the camp was formed, the General thought the victory was won, and proceeded at once to sit down in peaceful triumph upon his laurels; the very way to crush them. The enemy, consisting of a goodly array of the troops in the pay of Her Most Gracious Majesty came into the forest, expecting a vigorous resistance from men armed to the teeth, and opposing their breasts fanatically to the bayonet. The regulars were, however, grievously deceived. The insurgents did not wait even to discover what the smell of gunpowder was like, but scampered off at the first sound of the drum and fife.

Now, I had pretty hotly joined the movement, because it concerned very closely the fortunes of Mrs Winny Kear, the grandmother of the sweetheart of my bosom, and the capital encroacher upon the public land. Being sound in wind and limb, and young in blood, I endeavoured to oppose myself to timid counsel, and to stir up the foresters to fight.

"A spy!" cried Mr Prosser; "he is bribed to get us into trouble. Lay hold of him."

They did lay hold of me; they tied me, gagged me, and dragged me off. Mr Prosser's motive was revenge; and the foresters of Little Dean, who had got hold of me, being the roughest men of our community, carried the business a little to extremes. They took me to a coal-pit, which had been recently deserted, and sent me down there by the windlass. The man who went down with me discharged me at the bottom like rubbish from the basket, and was wound up again.

This might have been, and would have been a case of murder, if it were possible for a dozen countrymen to know a secret, and for none of them to leave it behind him at an alehouse. At eleven o'clock that night, Mary Llewellyn, who had sought me since noon, like a loving little soul, obtained a mere hint of my whereabouts. She knocked up Farmer Grimes who had been then two hours in bed, coaxed him to go with her into the rain, and let her down the pit. He went with her and let her down; he could not go himself, because she would not have relied upon her strength to wind him up again. She came down with a lantern, found me, and put brandy between my lips —then put something much sweeter upon my lips. After I got out of that pit, I lost no time in getting into another; we were married in Blakeney Church.—Well, well. Away with melancholy!

Several leaders of the forest outbreak having been taken and tried, their Commander-in-Chief, Mr Posser, among others, went abroad. The cases of old Mrs Winny Kear and others who had built cottages trespassingly on forest ground, were carefully dealt with by the Government, and leases were granted to them at a peppercorn rent for various terms, according to the length of time the several encroachments had existed. Winny fell asleep in peace, when death arrived to do for her what she had been doing all her life;—to gather her for ashes. I cannot say that since then I have lived in peace. But I am happy.

Shocking Murder in the Forest of Dean,—A powerful sensation has been produced the Forest of Dean, by the murder a labourer named Philip Cooke, under the following circumstances.—lt appears that the deceased, who lived at the Cross Ways, near' Coleford, and had been employed for short time in stripping hark at Usk, was return, ing home on Saturday night sennight, when on passing through the Beaulieu Wood, he observed a woman with a child in her arms, standing by two persons who were lying on the ground. He accosted the woman, and inquired what was the matter, when she told him that the men were intoxicated. He proffered bis assistance, and the men, who turned out to be Irish tinkers, and hawkers of list shoes, got up, and with his aid proceeded through the wood. reaching Stanton, one of the Irishmen .wished to have more beer, and quarrel arose between them on the subject, which however Cooke took part. Cooke then said to the woman you had better come on with me, as 1 shall be a better guard for you than these two fellows." He had scarcely uttered these words when the Irishmen both set upon him'and beat him dreadfully, trampling upon him when down with hobnailed shoes. At last they left off, and Cook got up and made the best of his way towards Colefo'rd. The men loitered and then pursued him, keeping his pace. It was nearly twelve o'clock when the party arrived at the Cross Ways, where Cooke lived. The latter went into his house, put down his things, and then ran and called a man of the name of Henry Yorkeand another named Jordon, the turnpike keeper. Yorke got up, followed his wife, and came into the road at the time when the Irish party were passing through theturnpike. The woman cried out, what are you going to beat the old man for?"—to which orke replied "that he was not going to beat any one. During this time Cooke stood with his hands crossed in the middle of the road, and Yorke demanded why they had been beating Cooke; on this the Irishwoman whispered to one of the men to get a stone, when he retired a pace or two back, where there was a broken stone fence, and taking two large slate stones in either hand advanced upon Cooke, saying, I'll split thy skull for thee;" he instantly flung one of the stones with all his force, and struck the unfortunate man on the temple. Cooke dropped, apparently dead and Jordan and Yorke made an attempt to capture the ruffian, who declared that he would serve them in the same manner if they came near him. They followed him down to a lodging-house between the Cross-Ways and Coleford, into which he entered, but escaped by the back-door, and has not since been heard of. The other man and the woman were captured few hours afterwards. Cooke lingered in a most distressing state until Thursday morning, when he expired. The stone had perforated his forehead, and the brain was only covered thin tegument, so that it is very, surprising how he survived so long. The deceased bore an excellent character, and has left a wife and two children to lament his loss. He was about 40 years of age.

The Iron Mines of the Forest of Dean.— Some of the primitive Iron mines In the Forest are great curiosities, although they easily escape the attention of strangers, from their secluded situation, and the obscurity of their entrances. small aperture, not unlike a fbx-eaiib, amongst projecting masses of limestone rock, admits the miner the scene his labours. descends partly wooden pegs driven into the soil, and the help of short ladder which carries with him, and thus arrives in the subterranean labyrinth from which he excavates the ore. These mines are worked labouring men, who ara "free minors** under the old forest laws, asdsted bv their families; and the ore is carried to the surface young bovs, in packages called •’billies,” which are secured the Imck, and thus secured they crawl hands, knees, and feet from the recesses the mine, till they climb into day-light. The hands ami knees of these j>uor boys are frequently hoofed ; the skin being converted into a boiry texture continual pressure. The iron ore, lying in ’ pockets' or churns,” as they are called the miners, ribbed in the limestone rock, loaves irregular passages and caverns lu all directions, after it has been dug out, that the Interior presents the most grotesque combinations pillars, cells, grottoes, lofty domes, and narrow low corridors of variously coloured limestone, the effect of which, under the purl i«l illumination of the miners’ candles, is often very imposing. This class * * y periinl alteration. In consequence of the application of capital to improved methods of mining on larger scale. The scene which the wrritcr wishes describe, is tlwj site of probably the most ancient mine-w-orks the kingdom, and not visited so frequently as it desetves to be. lies near the village of Dream, on the left of the turnpike road leading from kydnevto Coleford, and known the provincial appellation £e •Stmules,” a name commonly ai»pltod to old mine-works, and probably derived, as suggested a learned Forest Commissioner, from the British Ceatc/, signifying a cavern or excavation. the recesses of wood, near some of the primitive mines, you suddenly enter upon what at first sight appears to be an extensive and confused min, in deep dell, overgrown with ivy and lichen, and interspersed with lofty trees. These are. reality, the limestone rock left its natural formations after the iron ore had been carried away by the old British and Homan miners, who appear to have pursued course of mining downwards from the surface, clearing out the superficial "churns,” a<» far they extended in every direction, and thus leaving cavities and elevations which a long course of years lias given their present romantic appearance, obliterating all traces of the process, and clothing every hollow with vegetation. Tall and spreading tree* flourish on the very summits of some of the natural columns that rear their lofty forms amidst this wild scene ; others extend their branches over clustering rocks covered with raos? and creeping plant*, whilst devious paths, winding their way amongst these relics of nature exposed art, invite the visitor’s tarriance. whilst he Indulges the musing mood which such spot is calculated to inspire. But the most singular portion of these antique scowdes grotesque mas.? rocks, called the •' Devil’s Chapel," In which Is pulnit vast dimensions, appropriated the country people the infernal oratory of Satan w hen he officiates on solemn occasions amongst his congregations of demons and witches there a*sembled. In truth it is a scene well adopted to superstitious imaginings, and those old tales of witchcraft and diablerie, in which the arch-demon and his earthly colleagues celebrate their nocturnal orgies. A cloudy midnight such place, with glimpses of moonshine just revealing its ragged horrors, and profound shades—a fitful night-wind, and flapping boughs, with now and then the cry of an ill-omened bird, startling the ear, would make susceptible imagination run wild, peopling the solitude with its unutterable visions.

Wizardry on the Welsh Border. Beatrix A. Wherry, pp75-87

Wizardry on the Welsh Border.

(Read at Meetings 17th February, 1904)

[The following article, by a young lady who is still at school, is inserted in all its fulness of picturesque detail partly on account of the admirable object lesson it affords in the collection of folklore. Boys and girls have a great advantage in this work in the ease with which they can vanquish the barriers of racial or class prejudice, which are after all the main difficulties to be overcome. Miss Wherry has given fictitious names to her informants, but the genuineness of her narratives must be self-evident to any one who knows the garrulous dramatic visionary folk of the Welsh Marches. Readers will not fail also to note the close correspondence of the relative positions of witch and wise man in Monmouthshire with those of the witch and witch-doctor in Central Africa, as described in the preceding paper. — Ed.]

While staying at a farmhouse in Monmouthshire this summer, I tried to collect some stories about the wise men, ghosts, and superstitions of the place. I was indebted to our landlady, Mrs. Briton, for many of them, but she referred me to an old Mrs. Pryce, who, she said, could tell me more stories than anyone.

I first made the acquaintance of Mrs. Pryce in the stable-yard wishing to sell a "fine oak table." She was a weird-looking figure in her heavy cloak and cottage bonnet, but the most striking feature about her was the curious penetrating brightness of her eyes. Next day we all trooped down to see the table in her cottage at Trelleck. She was more witch-like than ever; so much so that I looked around for the black cat, which, however, was not forthcoming; she gave long histories of the usual six children whom she had buried, also of her quarrels with her landlord. She also wished to sell some chairs, for she said, "I've no need of chairs, being all alone, and I have the bench I used to kill pigs upon, 'twill not be used for that agen, so I may so well sit on it so long as I do live."

Two or three days afterwards she came up for the money for her table. Drawing me mysteriously out of the room she whispered on the stairs, "They're after me for the rent." She got her money and was then prevailed upon to "take a drop o' cider." I then took the opportunity of asking her if she knew anything about Jenkyns, the wise man, in whom I was very much interested, having heard a great deal about him.

"Lor' bless you, me dear," said she, "Why, Jenkyns 'as been a comfort to me all me life. If I ever 'ad a pain of any sort, rheumaticks, toothache, or what ye like, if I'd go to Jenkyns 'e'd always take it away. Anything that were lost, in all the country-side, 'e'd always find it. 'Deed I did miss old Jenkyns when 'e died, and many's the time I've wished 'im back agen."

I asked her what old Jenkyns' appearance was, and gathered that he was an oldish man, with a long dark beard; stooping, and walking with a stick. "He allus wore one o' those box 'ats," said Mrs. Pryce, "an' an old round coat about the house, but when 'e went to town 'e put on a long coat with tails,"

"But have you ever seen any of his charming, Mrs. Pryce?"

"Lor' bless you, yes, me dear," said she; "many an' many a time, but onst in particular I were dreadful skeered, an' I'll tell you all about it. One day one of me brothers had a toothache, so him an' me an' me other brother went up to old Jenkyns to have it charmed away. Jenkyns could charm away anything; many a time, when I've had rheumaticks or pain of any sort I'd go to Jenkyns an' say, 'Oh! Jenkyns, I do feel so bad, take away my pain, do now;' 'an' 'e'd say,' 'Well now, d'ye believe?' 'Oh, yes, I believe,' say I, an' there! the pain 'ud be gone.

"Well, as I was sayin', when the toothache was gone, Jenkyns went out o' the kitchen to fetch a drop o' cider, an' me brother see'd a big, big book on the comer of the table, an' began to look at it. Jenkyns hollers out from the other side of the house, 'Don't you touch that book, or it'll be the worse for you!' When 'e came back me brother says, 'You must have got the Old Man 'imself about 'ere to have such like goings on,' says 'e. Just then there came a great noise in the room above, bowling about the floor, like as if a great big ball were rollin' about 'All right,' says Jenkyns, 'if you don't look out, youll have him a bit closer.'

"With that 'e takes a candle an' blows into it, puts it on the table, an' draws a circle round it. Then the light all burnt dim an' blue, and the whole room got cloudy an' misty. Presently, we see'd a little old man sittin' in a chair next to Jenkyns, 'e was rockin' 'imself to and fro, and squeakin', 'Jenky, Jenky, Jenky!' an' again, 'Jenky, Jenky, Jenky!' Now 'e 'adn't come thro' the door, 'cos that was locked; an' 'e 'adn't come thro' the window, 'cos that was shut an' barred; an' yet there e' was, sittin' in the chair, calling 'Jenky, Jenky, Jenky!' an' 'Jenky, Jenky, Jenky!' Then Jenkyns blew into the candle agen, an' the dim blue light went away, an' the candle burned clear, an' lo an' behold! that little grey old man was vanished.

"'There!' says Jenkyns; but me brothers didn't wait to hear any more; they just took to their heels an' set off home as if the Old Man were after them, leavin' me to follow as best I could. But I believe to this day 'twas the Old Gentleman himself as we saw."

I asked her what had become of the big book, and what was in it, but she did not know, though she thought that the books were left to a nephew who had disappeared. She did not know the contents of them either, but said that "the Bible was a great book with him!" I had no time to ask any more questions, for Mrs. Pryce was launched on another story.

"One day there was a young man goin' to Monmouth races, an' as 'e was passin' 'is field, 'e see'd the cattle 'atin' of 'is crops. So 'e up an' took 'is jacket off an' throwed it over the gate, an druv' 'em off; but when 'e come back 'is jacket was gone. Now there was an 'ooman round there as 'e knowed 'ud take anything, but o' course 'e 'oodn't miss the Monmouth races, an' so 'e went without 'is jacket. But when 'e came back 'e told 'is wife, an' she told 'im to go off to old Jenkyns an' 'e'd get it back for 'im. Well, old Jenkyns 'e said, 'That 'ooman wont rest till she come an' put your coat back on the gate where she took'd it from. But what'll I do to punish 'er?'

"'Oh!' said the young man, 'don't do anything to hurt her, so long as I gets me jacket back.'

"'Well,' says the old Jenkyns, ' 'ow 'ud it be if I was to put the button 'ole on her cheek, just 'ere, under 'er eye?'

"'All right,' says the young man.

"An', sure enough, that 'ooman come'd n' put back that jacket on the gate, where she tooked it from; but ever arterwards she 'ad the mark of a black button-hole on 'er cheek, just beside 'er eye, so as everyone should know what sort of an 'ooman she was."

"But have you seen the mark, Mrs. Pryce?" I said.

"Why yes, me dear," said Mrs, Pryce, "t'was old So-and-so;" and with that she gave me her whole pedigree. "An' many a time have I seen that mark," said she. "Oh, Jenkyns always punished people when they stole things; there was those folk down to Pen-y-van, they had a bad time of it, I'll tell you about that. There was a farmer down by Pen-y-van, an' 'e 'ad a lot o' cider, but that all got stolen by four people. So 'e went to old Jenkyns to see what was to be done. But ole Jenkyns, 'Tisn't no good,' says he, 'the cider's drinked; I can't get it back for you, 'cos it's all drinked; but I'll tell you what I'll do,' says 'e; 'you come along to the green at six o'clock to-morrer evening, an' I'll make 'em dance;' an' sure enough he coom'd, an' there was these four people dancin' away on the green, men an' women. An' they couldn't help it, 'cos old Jenkyns 'ad put a spell on them, an' they danced for two hours for punishment, till 'e tooked the spell off. An' there was hundreds o' people watchin' 'em. Old Ann Griffiths, she told me all about it, how they was dancin' and jumpin' about, an' all the time ready to drop. Old Jenkyns, 'e was a watchin' quite pleased like for some time; then 'e got tired, tooked the spell off an' went home."

"An' it's not the first time 'e's punished people like that," said Mrs. Briton. "Don't you remember that 'ooman at the public down to Grosmont?" and she started on her story, Mrs. Pryce now and then putting in a nod of approval

"One day old Jenk3ms was going down town, an' 'e stopped at a public, 'The Cock and Feather,' to get some refreshment 'E asked for bread an' cheese an' beer; when 'e'd finished 'e asked 'ow much it was. 'Oh,' says the landlady, 'lef s see, six an' four's ten, that's tenpence, please.' Jenkyns said, 'twas too much, but 'e paid 'is tenpence an' went off.

"Presently the 'ooman came back into the room an' went up to the place where Jenkyns had been sitting, an' calls out,

"Six an' four's ten.  
Here's off agen.'

"An' she started runnin' round the table, an' when she came back to Jenkyns' place she called out again,

"'Six an' four's ten.  
Here's off agan.'

"An' started ninnin' round agen. Presently 'er daughter came in an' seed 'er mother runnin' round the table an' callin' out, so she knowed she'd got a spell on 'er. She went on like that for an hour and a half, then 'er son came back from work an' see'd 'is mother runnin' round the table, callin' out,

"Six an' four's ten.  
Here's off agen.'

"So 'e said, "Why, mother, what's t' matter?'"

An' she says, 'Oh, I don't know!

"'Six an' four's ten,  
Here's off" agen.'

"So 'e said to 'is sister, ''As so-an'-so been 'ere?' an' she said 'e 'ad, an' 'e said, ''Ow long's 'e been gone?' an' she said, 'Two hour.'

"So 'e went an' caught up old Jenkyns an' tells 'im what was wrong, an' Jenkyns says, 'Serve 'er right for chaigin' a poor man tenpence for a bit o' bread an' cheese. But,' 'e says, 'you go an' look under a candlestick on your mantelpiece; there youll see a bit of paper. Don't you look at it or it'll be the worse for you, but throw it in the fire. An' I hope this'll be a lesson to yer mother.'

"So the son went home, an' there was 'is mother, still runnin' round an' calling out,

"Six an' four's ten,  
Here's off" agen.'

"'E ran to the chimney-piece, there was the paper! an' 'e throwed it in the fire; 'is mother dropped into a chair, all exhausted like. An' it served 'er right."

Mrs. Briton stopped, quite exhausted, for she had been acting the story herself all the time, rushing round the table and shouting,

"Six an' four's ten,  
Here's off agen."

Mrs. Pryce and I were simply screaming with laughter, and it was some time before Mrs. Pryce went on, with a rather disjointed story about a witch:

"One day some folk came to old Jenkyns about a witch; they told 'im 'ow she used to turn herself into a hare an' stand on an old gate-post an' frighten folk terrible. Once there was some men goin' by an' they see'd 'er on the post, an' she called out

"Pee wow, pee wow!' and jumped down; an' they all runned away. So old Jenkyns he says, *You follow after her,' says 'e, 'an' stick a knife into 'er *third 'eel-mark*, then you'll be rid of her.' Now this old witch had put a spell on a woman in the village, so 'er husband an' 'er brother said they'd pay 'er out.

"They see'd the old lady goin' along the road one day, an' so in the third heel-mark from where she was they stuck a knife into the ground. She set up such a screechin' you could a' heard it for miles. 'Oo told you to do that' says she, an' begins sayin' things most awful. Then she went off limpin' like, as if a knife was put right thro' 'er foot So you see old Jenkyns 'e knew 'ow to settle witches, 'e did. Twas a pity he never see'd them on the Buckle. I'll tell you about them.

"One day there was a man going down the Buckle pitch, an' as 'e was goin' along, all of a sudden 'e 'eard sumthin' a comin' down behind 'im, an' 'e looked an' there 'e saw an old 'ooman a comin' gallopin' down the pitch on a piece of an old hurdle. She come right past 'im, an' 'e tried to catch hold of the hurdle; but no, 'e couldn't touch it, nohow. Then there came along another old hag, leppin' an' gallopin' on a ladder, an' behind her came another, as I'm alive, trundlin' on a common grindstone! They came right past 'im, an' on to a public beyond the pitch, an' there they stopped, an' them that wasn't too frightened tried to shoot 'em, but no, nothing couldn't touch 'em, nobody could catch hold of that hurdle, nor the ladder, nor the grindstone neither; an' presently they called, 'Pee wow. Pee wow!' 'an' was off again, so as nobody couldn't stop 'em."

"Well, now I'd like to have seen that," said Mrs. Briton. "I expect you'll be practising on one o' them old grindstones, won't you, to see if you can get along same as the witches? "

"Talkin' of witches," said Mrs. Pryce, "there was a wise woman way over the mountains some time ago, as I heard tell of. She could find anything that were lost. One day there was a man that had a very fine watch, an' 'e put it on the table one day while 'e went to clean 'isself, an' when 'e come back 'twas gone. So 'is mother went off 'way over the mountains to this old 'ooman. Jes' as she came up to the door a little dog run out barking. Then there came out a little, little old 'ooman. 'Don't you be afraid o' the dog,' says she; 'I know what you's come about. Twas your own niece as took the watch. You go back 'ome an' look under the stone next the pump in your scullery, an' there youll find it,' says she. 'An' will you have 'er that took it punished?' said she. But the 'ooman thanked her, and said so long as she got the watch back, she didn't care to punish any one, much less her own niece. So she went back, an' there sure 'nough she found the watch under a stone in the scullery. Now, weren't that strange, as the old 'ooman who'd never seen the place should know where the thing was?"

This was the last story Mrs. Pryce told me. Mrs. Briton, however, remembered some more about Jenkyns, and one day, when I was mangling for her, she told me the following:

"One day old Jenkyns was comin' up from Monmouth, and just on the pitch by the station was four horses strugglin' an' strainin' to drag a great piece of timber up the hill. They were pullin' an' men were pushin', an' then they'd be pulled back by the weight of it Jenkyns, he looked at them for some time, then he up an' shouts, 'Unhitch that fore horse!' So they unhitched him, 'cos nobody dared disobey anything that Jenkyns told them to do. 'Now hitch 'im on behind,' 'e said ; an' so they hitched 'im on behind. Then Jenkyns tooked the whip, cracked it, an' shouted, ' Now, me lads, all together!' An' would you believe it, them 'orses that couldn't move a step before, galloped up the hill like a top spinnin', an' the leader dancin' behind!"

Another day I cornered Mrs. Briton in the dairy, and bargained for a story. "Well," she said, "I'll tell you what I know 'bout old Sarah Griffiths. They used to say she was a witch, an' this was told me by old Jacob Jones 'isself, an' 'e ought to know. So if it's a lie, it's 'is own lie.

"It 'appened when Mr. Mason was livin' at the Argoed. 'Is gardener was very particler 'bout havin' turf from the 'ill, an' they 'ad ter bring it across the river in boats, an' old Tom Griffiths an' Jacob Jones, they was 'elpin'. Well, on the last day, when they'd got it all up, Mr. Mason's gardener, 'e left some money down at the Boat Inn, so as they should 'ave some beer, 'cause 'e was pleased they'd brought the turf up so quick. So Tom, when 'e went up to tea, 'e says to Sarah, 'e was goin' down for an hour, cos they was goin' to 'ave some singin' down at the 'Boat'; but Sarah, she said, 'Thee shassent go down theer; thee'st better stay at 'ome 'an 'ave thee's supper.'

"Well, Tom, 'e would'nt sUy, so she said, 'If thee goes down theer, thee bis'nt comin' 'ome to-night' An' she began to curse an' swear, an' say she wished the devil 'ud run off with 'im if 'e went down, but still 'e went.

"Well, 'e was a comin' up again, about ten, with old Jacob Jones, an' Jacob was a little way in front; 'e was a tellin' me about it arterwards. 'E said, 'It's as true as my hand's there,' 'e said, 'I felt myself goin' up, up, an' it took me breath away, it was so swift, an' I went up right over the hedge.' It were one of those 'igh 'edges all over dog-briars an' blackberry branches. An' 'e went right over, sheer down into the meadow the other side. Presently 'e 'eard some 'un swearin' close by, an' 'e said, 'Tom, is that thee? What f devil art doin' theer? 'An' Tom said, 'Jacob is that thee? What t' devil art doin' heer?'

"An' then they tried to get out, but they couldn't, an' they was all scrat about, an' bruised, an' cut, an' try as they might they couldn't get out, they was so buried in briars an' brambles. They lay there swearin' an' talkin' to one another till half-past five in the mornin', when they 'eard Dan an' Tom, their two boys, comin' up home from the dnworks. Then Jacob 'e called out 'Lor' bless thee, Dan, is that thee? Coom an' get us out o' this!'

"An' them two boys 'ad the greatest difficulty in gettin' 'em out, they was so stuck in them briars an' things. But at last they got out, an' when they got 'ome, there was old Sally boilin' the kettle, an' she said, 'I telled thee, Tom, thee oosn't come 'ome, an' thee didn't'

"There's another story I've just remembered about a witch," said Mrs. Briton; "I'll just tell you about it.

"There was an old witch used to live 'bout here, an' she had a daughter. Now there was a young man very fond of this girl, and wanting to marry her, but her mother hated him, and would have liked to have put him out of the way if she could.

"One day he came up to see his sweetheart, and there was her mother a brewin' somethin' in a saucepan on the fire. She says, 'Tom, do 'ee take t' kettle an' bring me some water from the well.' But the girl called out, 'Don't 'ee go, Tom. Oh! don't 'ee go.' 'You be quiet, ye interfering hussy,' says the old 'ooman. 'Here, Tom, take t' kettle.'

"So Tom took the kettle an' went off to the well, an' dipped it in; but 'e felt somethin' a pullin' an' pushin' him till it got 'is 'ead right under water as 'twere tryin' to drown him. O' course 'e struggled and kicked till 'e got 'is 'ead up again, an' then 'e looked round to see who 'twere, but there — there war'nt no one.

"'E couldn't see no one, but in two minutes somethin' had 'im again and got 'im under the water, an' all this time 'e couldn't get the kettle filled anyway. Three times 'e were took an' dipped in the well, an' it were a wonder 'e weren't drowned, for 'twas all 'e could do to keep 'is 'ead up. At last 'e got the kettle filled an' went back to the cottage.

"There was the old 'ooman still brewin' in the saucepan an' mutterin' to herself; but when she saw 'im that she thought was drowned come to the door with the kettle full she stopped all of a sudden an' looked at 'im that awful, an' a sort of a horrid laugh came out of the saucepan, an' the lid jumped off an' flew right up the chimney so as all the kitchen was filled with smoke an' the most awful smell. Then 'e knowed she 'ad been brewin' spells to kill 'im, so 'e dropped the kettle an' took to 'is 'eels, an' all up the road 'e could 'ear 'er cursin' 'im, an' I take it 'e was glad to get 'ome. But 'e never went after that girl agen."

Mrs. Briton is one of the few people from whom you can get ghost stories first hand; they are rather vague, but she believes in them implicitly.

"One day," she said, "our cattle got lost an' our two boys went out to look for them. They was out for hours an' hours, an' towards evening Bill Roberts brought the cattle home, but 'e 'adn't seen them boys. So I began to get anxious like, an' I went out all over the place huntin' an' callin' for them. At last it got quite dark, an' I was in an awful state o' mind: I put a lamp in the window to guide them if they was to come back, an' went out with my father to look for them again. We was just goin' past the house of a wicked, wicked old man what had just died (they told all kinds of stories about him, some said as 'e had killed 'is own wife); as I was sayin' we was passin' this house, an' I saw just beside me a big, big, black dog, as large as a calf, an' 'is eyes shone like lumps of fire. My father hit at it with 'is stick, an', would you believe me, the stick went right through it, an' 'twas still there!

"Bye-an'-bye, when we'd passed the house, the dog disappeared.

"'That's a sure token,' says my father, 'that them boys is in the river!'

"Well, you may believe that made me feel bad, but when we got 'ome the lamp was gone out of the window, an' I rushed upstairs, there was the boys fast asleep. Next momin' they told me how they'd got so tired an' gone to sleep in the road, an' woken up when it was dark an' come on home. But that day a telegram come to say as my brother 'ad been killed by a railway truck. So, you see, it was an omen, seeing that there dog."

There is a funny old house on the way to Penallt called the "Potash"; it is said to be haunted, but Mrs. Briton is the only person I have met who has seen anything there. This is her account:

"One night about twelve o'clock I was goin' along the road down to Mitchel Troy, where we used to live; I was just nearin' the 'Potash' when I heard like a lot of people talkin' in the air. First I thought 'twas the gypsies, but as I was comin' by the hedge in the field I saw a sort of a black cloud comin' thro' the gap, an' I heard a sound of dankin' chains, but all at once I knowed it wasn't gypsies 'cos they weren't there, an' I heard voices all around. I ran, an' ran, I was so frightened, till at last I fell right into a sand pit at the bottom of the hill."

Some other members of Mrs. Briton's family have seen visions too. Her son, Samuel, told me that one night, goin' up through Troy Woods, he had seen a great black beast with flaming eyes, and when he turned his lantern on it, it vanished with a sort of screech into a ditch.

Mr. Briton is said by his wife to have seen a black dog going nine times round a tree; I don't know if that is true, but after much cross-questioning, and with additions from Mrs. Briton, I made out that he really had seen something one night, when going to see his wife, who was nursing a sick woman in a him some way off. By the side of the road he saw a lady, dressed in a very old-fashioned way, holding her skirt up; her hair, of a sandy colour, was divided and arranged in two knots on the top of her head. Though it was a pitch-dark night he saw her plainly, and said "Good night;" but she passed him without speaking, and vanished up the road. Mr. Briton riished into the farm where his wife was, and told her be had seen the devil.

"Had 'e got a tail?" said she, laughing.

"No, but 'e had horns," he said; for he thought she had, from the way her hair was arranged.

"You should have followed her, and she'd have shown you a treasure if you'd asked her in God's name what she wanted," said Mrs. Briton sagely; and he wished he had.

"But, why did you think she was the devil?" I asked him. "Oh, I s'pose 'twas just a wicked thought of mine," he said.

I gathered some stories from Mrs. Briton about a mythical person, supposed to have come from Kentchurch `[TH: near Grosmont]` near by, who went by the name of Jack Kent. He is associated with the Druidical stones at Trelleck, and the cleft on the Skyrrid.

"They say that when Jacky was a little boy he made a compact with the devil, which enabled him to do anything he set his hand to.

"Once he was engaged by a farmer to scare crows; but there was a fair going on in the town, and Jack didn't mean to miss it, so he called all the crows together from all the fields round, and when they were all collected he sent them into an old barn, with no roof to it. But Jack put the crows in there and said something to them, and they couldn't get out, try as they might So Jack, he went to the fair, but when he had been enjoying himself there a bit, he met his master. (Now his master had specially told him he was not to go to the fair, or else the crows would be after the crops.) So the farmer said, 'Hullo, Jack, what art doin' here? Didn't I tell thee to look after th' crows?' But Jack says, 'T' crows be all right, master.' And he took the farmer to the old barn, and sure enough there was the crows, and they couldn't get out, altho' that barn had no roof, until Jack told them to. `[Cf. Folklore Journal, i., 370 [TH: actually, 379] (where Kent is misprinted Rent); also vol. ii., p. 10, and F. Hindes Groome's In Gipsy Tents (Nimmo), p. 11, whose version of the story has been heard in Shropshire also. — Ed.]`

"Jack bested the devil in everything. One day they were walking through a turnip-field, and Jack made a bet that he could get more profit out of the field, if they shared it, than the devil could. (The turnips weren't above ground then, but Jack knew they were there.) Jack asked the Old Boy if he'd have Tops or Bottoms. He said 'Tops,' so Jack got the turnips and the Old Boy the greens.

"Next year the Devil took the bet again, an' this time he made sure he'd win, so he said he'd have Bottoms; but Jack, be had took precautions, an' that field came up wheat, so he got the corn an' straw, an' the Devil got the roots, which of course wasn't much good.

"Then they went to threshing. Jack was to have Bottoms this time, so he got the barn floor, and the Devil went on top; so he put up a hurdle for the Devil to thresh on, and as he battered away Jack had all the corn on the floor.

"Then they made a bargain that Jack was to build a bridge over Trothy Weir, Grosmont, before the cock crowed in the morning, but Jack did not before the cock crowed, and there the stones lie to this day, many a ton.

"Jack did some wonderful things in his time. Why! one day he jumped off the Sugar Loaf Mountain on to the Skyrrid (and there's his heel-mark in the Skyrrid to this day). An' when he got there he began playing quoits, he pecked (threw) three stones as far as Trelleck, great, big ones, as tall as three men (and there they still stand in a field), and he threw another, but that didn't go quite far enough, and it lay on the Trelleck Road, just behind the five trees, till a little while ago, when it was moved so as the field might be ploughed; and this stone, in memory of Jack, was always called the Pecked Stone.

"The Devil swore he'd have Jack's soul whether he were buried inside or outside the church; but when Jack died he was buried just under the wall of Grosmont Church, with his head inside and his legs outside, and a great stone (which has since been moved) was put to mark the place. So the Devil never got him."

In Monmouthshire there is a curious custom called "New Year's Gifts." On New Year's Eve the village children bring round apples, with three sticks for legs, and surmounted by a sprig of box adomed with hazel-nuts, fastened on by slitting the nut at the top and inserting a leaf of the sprig. I have heard, too, that in the spring, when the crops are just beginning to sprout, the men go into the field, taking cider with them, light a fire, and "say something" over the corn. On Good Friday it is right to bake a small loaf, which is to be kept till the same date next year; it will not go bad. Some of this loaf ground up is a certain cure for various illnesses.

Mrs. Briton says that if you kill an adder, and before sundown hold it over a flame of fire, its four legs will come out. She has seen it!

"Among the early specimens of his [ John of Rent’s] magical skill, while a farmer’s boy in the vicinity he confined a number of crows, which he was ordered to keep from the corn, in an old barn without a roof, that he might visit Grosmont fair.

DISTURBANCES IN ENGLAND.—Some disturbances have broken out amongst the miners of the Forest of Dean, similar to those of the mining districts of Monmouthshire and South Wales.

Bristol Mercury - Saturday 27 April 1822

TO DO

CAUSE OF THE DISTURBANCES IN THE GREAT MINING DISTRICTS. The Country has now, unfortunately in more parts than one, an opportunity of practically proving the justice of the recent opinion, so authoritatively pronounced by Lord Londonderry, as to the advantages of low wages, as well as of the truth of his assertion, that "all classes were in a stale of prosperity, excepting the agricultural." The state to which his Lordship and his colleagues have reduced the Countrv, compels the manufacturer to reduce the prices of labour; for, if he sells the product of his manufacture at all, he must sell it at low prices, and to do this he must manufacture cheaply; consequently labour (the cost of which forms so material a part of the value of manufactured articles) must be had at low prices. Lord Londonderry's maxim in favour of low wages could not have come more ungraciously out ofthe mouth of any living being; for be has been, above all others of the present day, the man who, by laying immense burdens on the Country, has rendered it n~irossmilE for the labourer to subsist an LOW wages. The fact is, the taxes, seen and unseen, direct and indirect (the latter, be it ever remembered, vastly more onerous than the former), take so much from every man's labour and income in this country, as either to cripple his means, or wholly to deprive him of the ability to live in any sort of comfort or ease without enormous wages, or a great income from some source or other. Under these circumstances, the Iron-Masters (for, although the argument bears aliko on other manufacturers, the dreadful situation of the great Mining Districts of the kingdonpref'erablv claims our more immediate attention), finding that they rnust either sell their iron, when made, at a price lower than ever before known, or not at all, have (since the months of June or July last) made, or attempted to make, some two, and others three, distinct reductions in the wages of their workmen; and, great as must be the amount of these reductions, we are not aware that it is at all disproportionate to the necessities of their case; on the contrary, if the price of iron should not rise, of which permanently there is very little room to hope. it is well understood that still other reductions in the expense of making iron must take place, or the works cannot be carried on but at a loss, and consequently cannot be expected long to be carried on at all, at least to any thing like their present extent. Here then exists an absolute necessity for low-priced labour * and feeling this, not only fiom the exercise of their common sense, but from exprimental suffering (for we have heard, from authority which we have no reason to doubt, that great losses were en- dured by several very respectable Iron-Masters last year; and it is known too well, that absolute stoppages of others in the central Mining Districts have actually taken place) the Iron-Masters generally have endeavoured to reduce the wages of their workmen accordingly; and what has been the consequence, the deplorable state of Staffordshire, Shropshire, Monmouthshire, and South Wales, forcibly proclaims in a language which goes at once to the heart and to the understanding of every one. For these consequences, where they are the result solely of low. wages, the masters are not answerable. It is the work of necessity on their part; and, in a natural and healthy' state of the country, moderately low wages may be desirable; because the extent of the sale of the manu- factured article, next to its goodness. depends upon its cheapness; but it may be, and it certainly is, that m n inry he oppressed by such a rate of wages as alone the manu- facturer can afford to pay, or that it is the interest of the manufacture itself should be given ;-but then this is solely caused by the effect of measures emanating from a bad administration of public affairs. Where Government takes a great proportion of the proceeds of labour and of the income of property to its own use, it follows that by so mnuck the less remains for the use of the individuals who compose the aggregate of the society so nzis-governed. Thus to apply this indubitable principle in political economy to the present unhappy case of the labouring 1)ool in this country, it was admitted by a very acute disciple of the Pitt school of politics, but who from woful experience came at length to doubt the in- fallibility'of its principles; and who was himself at the time in Parliament5 that considerably more than one half of the wages of every poor man's labour went in taxes; and the accuracy of this statement has not only never been disproved, but is capable of defying disproof. There is no doubt it is so. It is not because the tax-gatherer and the titheman do not call periodically at the door of the labourer for assessed taxes, and for a tenth part of the produce of the earth, that he therefore does not pay taxes, ansl tithes, and poor-rates too; though he may be even discharged from the poor-rate by the hiumane considera- tion of' the magistrates. The poorest labourer pays all these burdens in the increased price of the provisions and necessaries of life; not an article of food goes into his mouth, not a particle of raiment clothes his back, huat he pays so much the more for them all than he would if there were no taxcz, no tithes, no poor-rates; and therefore he contributes in reality wed in fact to all these public 4ur- dens, and enormously tooas Mu. QPston has demonstrated; for, as the Duke of Bedford said at tub late Cambridge County Meeting, with truth unquestionable, * 27-re was scarcely (/ thaignblt whac was under the gripe of the exrcib .s Izanl oi:the ta-r-oilector ; even th very light of heaven was doubly tared; irst in the manufacture (of i/e glass, ansd tIen in the assessed taxes. The poor mian, whlo creeps into his hovel, is taxed for tI/e candle, the miserable candle, that tights Iissi to his pallet. Thns it is," as the Noble Duke added, "that taxutiens takes hold of every thing ;' and thus it is that faxation, by taking hold of the poor man's scanty means, renders low wages totally unequal to the decent support of himself and family. These are truths which in the present state of things it behaves no one to be ignorant of; but above all men, that Which their workcnuc at 1sresenlt iCCL, it behoves the Iron- Masters to know. The alarming situation of the Mining Districts arises not mainly out of the fault either of the master or the man, h t out of thc present dreadfully over- bu~rdened state of the country, which will not permit on the one hand the l'Ibourer to exist on low wages, and which at the sate time will not admit of Lhe mnatter selljing the produce of his works at such price as will enable bhi to afford h/igh wases. It fbliows then, necessarilv, that it is the real interest of the Iron-Master to promote such retrenchment and reform as will relieve the country of a large proportion of its public I nirdns; and the master-key to all these is such a ?eflurm in thAe Reps'ces62tatiea of' i;e Peotle in the Commons 1e use of Parlianient as will .estore Parliaments to their shorter term of duiotibn in letter. times, and extend the elective franchise so as to make the exercise of it more like what it was in the happier days of our forefathers, and a more equitable resemblanice of that which the Constitution intended, and which it is the inalienable right of Britons to enjoy. For taxation without representation is not only, what Lord Chathamn called it, "TYRANNY," but it will also in the end be found to be the Most MISTAKEN AND MISCHIEVOUS POLICY. The Mining Districts of Staffordshire and Shropshire are reported to be, in some respects, even in a worse situation than those of Moninouthihire and Sbuth Wales; and in the Forest of Dean disturbances are skid to have broken out. Oar London Papers did not arrive last night: Lord John Russell brought on his motion on Parliamentary Reform on Thursday evening; we have not learnt, though we can easily anticipate, its fate.

Monmouthshire Merlin - Saturday 01 January 1831

TO DO

FOREST OF DEAN. To the Editor of the Monmouthshire Merlin. SIR,- Whilst the greatest part of the kingdom are now labouring under great degrees of excitement, I have to exult in being a resi- dent in the most peaceable part of the king's dominions for altho' the inhabitants are Foresters (a term of terror to some timid per- sons who are not acquainted with their real character), we have not had a single instance of incendiarism, dislovalty, rebellion, or riot, in any town, village, or hamlet between the rivers Severn and Wye, whilst our neighbours on every side have had repeated acts of diabolical pursuits. Although there are many thousands of the labouring classes suffering great and severe privations from the general distress, there still is not to be found in any class (and I am in the habit of visiting all classes daily) an instance of strife-stirring persuasion they gene: ally and universally hold the unpardonable incendiaries in the greatest abhorrence. It is true they have lost many valuable local privileges through their apathy, but they possess too much of the real British character to run into rashness and liot. under the mistaken notion of bettering their condition. Indeed their peaceable demeanour, and truly praiseworthy decorum, at this period of general excitement, en- tities them justly to public congratulation and I will assert, Mr. Editor, without the fear of contradiction (for I travel at all hours), that although the Forest of Dean appears to the eye of the stranger a wild and dreary place, still the most timid may travel either by night or day, from Sabrina to Vaga, or from East to West of this immense track of land, without the fear of rob- bery, riot, or molestation, and with much greater safety than any of the streets of London, Bristol, or their suburbs. A case of highway robbery is not known among us, and the few, very few cases of burglary that have happened have been committed by strangers and adepts in the felonious calling but should we be visited by any of the Swingites, depend upon it, Mr. Editor, the Foresters will give a long pull, a strong pull, and a pull altoge- ther, to stop the unprincipled marauder and the vilt, disturber of public tranquillity. But, thank God, sir, we want no military visitors, no yeomanry police, no special constables. We are, Mr. Editor, poor, poor, very poor but we are also quiet, quiet, very quiet. I am, Mr. Editor, your most obedient servant, Forest of Dean, Dec. 29, 1830. ACORNPATCH

Evans and Ruffy's Farmer's Journal - Monday 20 June 1831

TO DO

FOREST . OF DEAN. _ The Government inclosures of this Forest were thrown down about a fortnight since, by • large body of the foresters, who appear to have acted under the impression that the right of commonage reverted to them at the end of 21 years. On Sunday evening two troops of the 3rd Dragoon Guards arrived in GrAford from Dorchester, who were joined on Alontlay morning by the militia staff, pensioners, &c., from this town, amounting to 70 Men. The Duke of Beaufort, Lord Lieutenant VI the county, the Martinis of WOl. cester, and several Magistrates, had also assembled; and many gentlemen resident in this town and its vicinity volunteered their services in aid of the authe. rities. At 11 o'clock a detachment of dragoons. 50 of the infantry, under the command of 31ajor Mack. worth, • large body of keepers, two of the London police establishment, accompani ed by a body of Magistrates and gentlemen, moved offfor the forest, and scowered the country in the direction of Parkend and Bream ; in this entire district, which presented such a busy 'cent last week, scarcely a human being was to be seen. This force returned to Culford at five o'clock, having captured seven prisoners, who were identified as having been employed in tearing down the fences. About this time an alarm reached the 51agistrates that the foresters hail assembled in considerable force on the Ruardean-hill, and were engaged in destroying the remaining embankments. A troop of dragoons was immediately dispatched to this quarter, but their very appearance in the distance fright. ened the levellers, and before the dragoons reached the work of destruction, not a man was to be seen. As night was now drawing on, the troop returned to Ledford with onc prisoner, having previously sent in two others. The 10 prisoners taken, with the exception of two, are young lads scarcely arrived to manhood ; after a brief examination before the Magill. traces, they were confined in the room above the market house, and a strong guard plseed over them. The little town of ColMrd was literally filled with strangers, and there appeared the best feeling among these visiters to aid the Magistrates. A strong te. action in the minds of the foresters had already taken place: they are now painfully convinced they have been the dupes of a tew bad men, and it is extremely probable, if these leaders have not escaped, the foresters themselves will be active in their apprehension. A sort of offer of compromise was made yesterday, to make a general surrender if bail would be accepted; but this was refused by the Magistrates. That these leaders have used the names of persona of distinction, to give colour to their proceedings, is , clearly ascertained; but it is to be hoped, lot their honour, that it will be as clearly proved that they have been used without authority. From a most careful examination of the whole of this unfortunate affair, it would seem, by artifices so improbable as scarcely to be credible, that tine man (Warren James,) effected a combination so complete amidst the foresters, that 4,0014 er Zr.fittli men could be collected by a war-whoop (ter literally this was the signal for assemblieg), and had them, when a.sembled, au completely under control, that his iime for the tommission of any act of violence would have been the foresters' warrant for its execution.. The amount of damage is variously estimated ; the extent of fencing destroyed is supposed to exceed SO miles, and its repargtion to cost 4:15.000; and this daniage, leaving out of the question the effect of in a neighbourhood abounding with newly enclosed lands, and the quantum of suffering which will be inflicted on the agents in this business, niight have been prevented by foresight, in providing a small force to suppress the evil at it first development ; and there was sufficient time for this, for three days' notice was fairly given, and that to persons officially connected with the forest, of the intention of the levellers. The accounts from the lonmouthshirc hills are still favoutable : the men are at their employ ; there have been no assemblages to disturb the peace, and the iniagibation of the agitators is now almost exhausted in the invention of descriptive accounts of scenes which neter existed but in the chimera ut a If itiAttit brain.

[John of Kent]

Grosmont is now a small and neat village; but was once a place of considerable importance, and is still governed by a mayor and burgesses. The natives boast of its former extent, point out spots at some distance which formed streets of the town, and allude to a tradition, that the market was once held on the side of the Graig. But a more decisive proof of its former importance is derived from the numerous causeways, which diverge from it in several directions, and which in any other county should have conceived to be remains of Roman roads. Two of these causeways may be traced to the distance of a mile, one leading towards the Graig and the Abergavenny road, and the other, towards the extremity of the village, in the direction of Scenfreth and Monmouth, which is supposed by the natives to have been a street of the town. These roads are raised to the height of several feet, and though much dilapidated, are still in many places from nine to twelve feet broad; the stones are laid one on the other, several which I measured were not less than nine feet in length, and of proportionate breadth and thickness. Within the memory of the inhabitants, roads of a similar construction led in other directions, but have been demolishied for the sake of the materials.

As Newcastle teems with tales of sprites and elves, so Grosmont rings with the achievements of John of Kent, whose exploits almost eclipse the adventures of baron Munkhausen. Old and young women, men and boys, unite in relating with extreme volubility, and without the smallest disagreement, a series of extraordinary tales concerning this wonderful personage. Like Dr. Faustus, he is faid to have made a compact with the devil; but more successful than the doctor, he evaded the conditions of his covenant, and outwitted the prince of darkness, both in his life and at his death.

Among the early specimens of his magical skill, while a farmer’s boy in the vicinity, he confined a number of crows, which he was ordered to keep from the

[image Grosmont Castle]

corn, in an old barn without a roof, that he might visit Grosmont fair. "And sure enough," said the old woman, who told me the anecdote, "they were there; for they made a terrible clatter, and would not fly away till Jack himself came and released them."

Kentchurch House, the neighbouring seat of the Scudamore family, by whom he was hired as a servant, became afterwards the scene of his marvellous exploits, which it would be tedious to recount. But the feat of all others, which most endears his memory to the inhabitants of Grosmont, was the construction of the bridge over the Monnow, leading to Kentchurch; it is still called John of Kent's bridge, and is said to have been built in one night by one of his familiar spirits. "But it could not be the devil, sir," added the relater of the tale, "for he would never have done so good an action."

An old tombstone in the church yard, close to the east wall of the chancel, is said to cover his body, and the legend reports, that he was interred under the wall to evade the condition of his compact which stipulated, that if buried either within the church, or out of the church, he should become the property of Satan. At the time of both my visits to Grosmont, this tomb was covered with a quantity of rubbish, which prevented me from inspecting it; but I was informed by the clerk, and by many other persons, that it contained no inscription.

A cellar at Kentchurch house is still shewn as the stable where he kept horse, on which he traversed the air with the speed of Lapland witches; and his portrait on wood, painted in oil, of which an engraving is annexed, is likewise there preserved.

The family of Kentchurch, to whom I applied for the true character and actions of this reputed sorcerer, could afford no specific or positive information. According to tradition, he was a monk, educated at one of the universities, and remarkable for his learning; in an age of ignorance, his acquirements excited the astonishment of his contemporaries, and like friar Bacon he was esteemed by the vulgar a necromancer. A Latin translation of the Bible, on vellum, which was either made or copied by him, was preserved in the family, but has been long mifsaid or destroyed.

Various opinions have been entertained concerning this mysterious perfonage. According to fome he was the John of Kent, Gwent, or Went, a Franciscan, thus mentioned by Leland: "He was bred in Wales, and so ardently followed the most celebrated schools of the Franciscans at Oxford, and made such improvements in profound learning, that he was the wonder of all his religious brethren." According to the antiquities of the English Franciscans, he was born at Chepstow, became professor and doctor of divinity, and on account of his extraordinary virtue was chosen minister provincial of the order in England. He wrote many learned and pious works, particularly Commentaries on the Master of the Sentences, Sermons to the People, and Disputed Questions. He died in 1348; and the catalogue of the provincial ministers says of him, "Brother John Went, doctor of Oxford, who wrought miracles in his life time, lies at Hereford." Baker, in his Chronicle, mentions another John of Kent among the men of learning in the reign of Henry the third `[Leland, Scrip. Brit, p.376. Antiq. of the E. Francisc. p. 159. Baker's Chronicle, p. 132.]`.

According to others he was a bard of Owen Glendower, and became domesticated in the family on the defeat of his chieftain, whose daughter married a Scudamore.

A tradition however fhill prevails, that an old wizard, difgnlfed in a fliepherd’s habit, once roamed about in the neighbourhood of Grofmont, frequented Kentchurch Houfe, and was buried privately under the Hone in the church yard,, below the eaft window of the chancel, which is called John of Kent’s tombftone. A refpedtable perfon, long relident in the village of Kentchurch, from whom I derived this information, conjeflures that this wizard was Owen Glendower himfelf, who, when proferibed, wandered about in a (hepherd’s habit, and took refuge with one of his daughters. It is likewife remarkable, that the ’place of Owen Glendower’s death, or fepulture, has never been pofitively afeertained ; fome fuppofe, though without fufficient authority, that he was interred


[Image John of Kent]

at Mornington in Herefordshire, the feat of one of his sons in law, others, with still less probability, that he was buried in the cathedral of Bangor.

`[A curious passage from the Memoirs of Owen Glendower is here submitted to the reader, p. 73. "A. D. 1415, death put a period to Owen's life and misery upon the eve of St. Matthew. Some say he died at his daughter Scudamore’s, others at his daughter Mornington’s house. They had both harboured him in his forlorn condition. They say that he was fain to go up and down disguised in a shepherd’s habit, to his daughters' and other friends' houses. Where Owen was buried cannot now be ascertained. But my countrymen, whether from tradition or conjecture, know not, suppose a grave under the great window in the fouth isle wall of Bangor cathedral, to be his place of interment. This mural monument is singular and much noticed; it lies within the wall, having a hollow arch over it, and a short buttress to support it. The stone, which is of the grit kind, has no inscription on it, or any adornment besides a large ill formed cross." "Humphrey, a late bishop of Bangor, and a great antiquary, did not credit this report, but firm;y believed, from a passage in Giraldus' Itinerary, that it was the mausoleum of Owen Gwynedd, prince of North Wales. A. D. 1138."

Though now an insignificant cluster of habitations, Grosmont was formerly a town of some note. Many exterior traces of buildings, and raised causeways, constructed like Roman roads with large blocks of stone, diverging from it, prove its antique extent and importance to have been considerable: nor is the legend of the place deficient in asserting its quondam consequence.

But with still higher interest, with more voluble earnestness, the natives recount the exploits of their reputed necromancer, John of Kent. Among a thousand other instances of his magical skill, they confidently assure you, that when he was a hoy, being ordered to protect some corn from the birds, he conjured all the crows in the neighbourhood into a barn without a roof, and by force of his incantations obliged them to remain there while he visited Grosmont fair. A greater service that he performed for the countrywas, his building the bridge over the Monnow in one night by the agency of one of his familiars. Long did his strange actions frighten men out of their wits; and at length, dying, he outwitted the devil; for, in consideration of services while living, he agreed to surrender himself to his satanic majesty after his death, whether he was buried in or out of church; but, by ordering his body to be interred under the church wall, he contrived to slip out of the contract. A stone in the church-yard, near the chancel, is said to mark the spot of this interment.

Higher tradition relates, that this extraordinary personage was a monk, who, possessing a greater knowledge in natural philosophy than could at that time be generally comprehended, was reputed a sorcerer. The family of the Scudamores, at Kentchurch-house, about a mile from Grosmont, where he became domesticated, had a Latin translation of the Bible written by him on vellum, but which is now lost. An ancient painting of him upon wood is, however, preserved in the mansion; and a cellar in the house is described to have been the stable of his horses; steeds of no vulgar pedigree, which carried him through the air with more than the speed of witches.

From a collation of different legends and circumstances, several respectable enquirers are inclined to believe, that this necromancer was no other than the famous Owen Glendower; who, after his defeat, and the dispersion of his army, concealed himself in the disguise of a bard, or wizard. A strong circumstance which favours this conjecture is, that the daughter of Glendower married a Scudamore, who at the time occupied Kentchurch-house. It may also be remarked, that neither the time of the chief's death, nor the place of his sepulture, were ever positively ascertained.

Upon our return to Monmouth from this excursion, we had the good fortune to fall into the company of Mr. Wathen of Hereford, the benefit of whose local information apd obliging assiduities has been felt by numerous tourists, as well as ourselves. This gentleman pointed out the most striking beauties of the Wye toward Ross; and of his directions we gladly availed ourselves the following morning, when we bade adieu to Wales and Monmouthshire. But, as it is my object to effect a general delineation of that tract of country, I shall not hesitate to break the thread of my tour, and suspend a description of the Wye's scenery and some further continuance of our route, while I traverse the north-western part of Monmouthshire, and the eastern frontier of South-Wales, which yet remains unexplored. In this part of my work, I must describe things as they appeared to me six years since, when I visited this portion of country in my return from a tour through the North of England and Wales, assisted by the best documents and observations that I have since been able to procure.
