THE FOX-GLOVE.

Among the flowers that are to be found blooming in cottage gardens, and the gardens of those who love old-fashioned bloseoms, this season of the year, none is more handsome or of more stately presence than the tall foxglove, with its spire of beautiful bells. The formal gardener rather despises it, and would be inclined to put it contemptuously aside as a mere wild flower, one the vagrant children of the wayside ditch or hedge, of the country lane or woodland border; but all lovers of our good old English flowers cherish the foxglove. Whether the bells are of purple or of the rarer white, delicately speckled within, they chime their inaudible music for the delectation of all who are fond of old-fashioned flowers in old-fashioned gardens. As a wild flower it is common in many parts of the country, especially the southwestern counties. Carrington, the Devonshire poet, says—

Upon the sunmr bank  
The foxglove rears its pyramid bells,  
Gloriously freckled, purple and white, the flower  
That cheers Devonia'a fields.

There are few counties, indeed, where its tall spires may not be seen.

Much ink has been shed in discussing the question of the origin of the name. There has long been a popular delusion, much favoured of sentimental writers, that foxglove is "corruption" of "folks-glove," and that these folk are identical with the "good folk," otherwise the fairies. This is just one of those prettily sounding fancies that captivate those who write about flowers with abundance of sentiment, but little knowledge of etymology. The fact is, that fox is fox, just as glove is glove. The flower has been the glove of the fox since Saxon times. The "folks-glove" heresy is the growth of the present century. The Anglo-Saxon name was "foxes glofa," which simply means fox's glove. If the question be asked—why fox?—one can only reply that there is no accounting for the fancifulness that has presided at the christening of so many popular flowers. Animal names have been largely employed in this connection, as everyone who is familiar with the popular names of our plants and flowers is well aware. In some cases a certain appropriateness, certain degree of appositeness and meaning can be discerned; but in others fancy, pure and simple, seems to be the only sponsor accountable.

The foxglove has had and has various other names. An old medical work of 1684 leaves out the glove altogether, and informs us that excellent treatment for paralysis takes the form of "bathes wherein proper herbs, especially foxes, have been boiled." In the neighbourhood of Mr. Crockett's beloved Galloway, the flower is called "tod-tail," which means "fox-tail." In many of the southern and south-western counties of England foxgloves are rather curiously known as poppies, or more shortly, "pops." This seems to have arisen, not from any confusion with the gorgeous flowers that glow amid the gold of the wheat, but simply from the fact, discoverable by every child, that by closing the mouth of the perianth with the hand and inflating the bag so formed it can then "popped" like paper bag, by striking it sharply against the back of the hand. The poppy proper is often known as red weed, and similar interchanges of flower names in popular speech are far from uncommon. The bindweed, for instance, is called hedge-lily in the Isle Wight. An old herbalist, remarking on sundry points of resemblance between the lily and the bindweed, or wild convolulus, says quaintly and prettily that the latter "is as it were an imperfit worke of nature learning to make lilies."

Another group of foxglove names connect the flower with fairies and witches—a long-standing connection which has, of course, been used to support the "folks glove" story. Such are fairycap, fairies' thimble, and fairies' petticoats. Welsh popular names for the flowers mean fairies' glove and fairies' fingers. In the north the foxglove flowers are called fairy bells. Hartley Coleridge writes of the fays

That sweetly nestle in the foxglove bells,

and says in a note, "Popular fancy has generally conceived a connection between the foxglove and the good people. In Ireland, where it ia called lusmore, or the great herb, and also fairy-ceap, the bending of its tall stalks is believed to denote the unseen presence of supernatural beings. The Shefro, or gregarious fairy, is represented as wearing tho corolla of the foxglove on his head, and no unbecoming head-dress either." A lady writer on flower-lore says that in Ireland it is not thought safe to meddle with the foxglove after sunset, because of the "good people" — "especially if its tall spike of drooping bellshaped flowers nod above the ditch of an old ancient fort which the leprechaun haunts."

The flower has other associations, more sinister than those with the fairies. It is called witches' thimble. Most readers will remember the ghastly case of witch-burning which took place in a remote and isolated district not far from Clonmel, in the South of Ireland, about five years ago. Among the many horrible details of revolting and savage superstition which were brought to light in the course of the trial, was a frequent mention of "herbs" as having been forced into the miserable victim's mouth. There can be little doubt that these were parts of the foxglove. Mr. Leland Duncan, who has collected the folklore of County Leitrim and its neighbourhood says that he was told that if a child was thought to be a chanegleing, one way getting back the real and banishing the spurious child was to seat it on a shovel and swing it out the door backwards and forwards, saying, "If you're a fairy, away with you!" "You should also," he adds, "previous to this little ceremony, give it luamore (foxglove), three drops on the tongue and three in each ear."

Sir Walter Scott, in the first canto of the "Lady of the Lake," describing a Highland glen, says—

Fox-glove and night-shade, side by side,  
Emblems of punishment and pride,  
Group'd their dark hues with every stain  
The weather-beaten crags retain.

But why the foxglove should be an emblem of punishment the writer knows not. It is melancholy think how much of dark and sinister association and significance has gathered round some of the most beautiful of flowers. But perhaps the foxglove owes the darker side of its lore to the fact that an active poison can be obtained from the plant; though Digitalis, besides being a poison, is also a valuable remedy in certain forms of disease. It may be noted, by the way, to return to the subject with which we started, that this scientific name of the poison—which is prepared from the dried leaves of the plants — comes from "digitale," the finger of a glove. The comparison is, indeed, so obvious that it appears in various languages. Both the Dutch and German names emphasise the finger resemblance, while in France it is called "Doigts de la Vierge," at "Gants de Kotre Dame."
