Little

Musgrave

and

Lady

Barnard

€

As it fell one holy-day,

As many be in the year, •

When young men and maids together did go Their matins and mass to hear.

Little Musgrave came to the church door. The priest was at private mass ;

But he had more mind of the fair women. Then he had of our lady: 's grace.

The one of them was clad in green.

Another was clad iti pall ;

And then came in my lord Bernard: 's wife. The fairest amonst them all.

She cast an eye on little Musgrave,

As bright as the summer sun.

And then bethought this little Musgrave,

This lady: 's heart have I won.”

Quoth she, I have loved thee, little Musgrave,

Full long and many a day ; ”

“ So have I loved you, fair lady.

Yet never word durst I say.”

I have a bower at Bucklesfordbery,

Full daintily it is dight ;

If thou wilt wend thither, thou little Musgrave, Thou: 's lig in mine arms all night.”

«

Quoth he, : ': ' I tj^ank ye, fair lady.

This kindness thou showest to me ;

But whether it be ^o my weal or woe.

This night I will lig with thee.”

With that he heard a little tiny page,

By his lady: 's coach as he ran :

“ Allthough I am my lady: 's footpage.

Yet I am lord Barnard: 's man.

“ My lord B^nard shall know of this.

Whether I sink or swinj : ”

And ever where thg bridges were broke,

He laid him down to swim.

“ Asleep, or wake ! thou lord Barnard,

• •As thou art a man of life ;

For little Musgrave is at Bucklesfordbery,

Abed with thy own wedded wife.”

If this be true, thou little tiny page,

This thing thou tellest to me,

Then all the land in Bucklesfordbery I freely will give to thee.

“ But if it be a lie, thou little tiny page.

This thing thou tellest to me,

On the highest tree in Bucklesfordbery Then hanged shalt thou be.”

He called up his merry men all : —

Come saddle me my steed ; •

This night must I to Bucklesfordbery,

For I never had greater need.”

And some of them whistl: 'd, and some of them sung.

And some these wdrds did say.

And ever when my lord Barnard: 's horn blew,

“ Away, Musgrave, away ! ”

“ Methinks I hear the thresel-cock,

Methinks I hear the jay ;

Methinks I hear my Cord Barnard,—

And I would I were awa/,”

thresd: 'coek, thrush.


 Lie Stilly lie still, thou little Musgrave,

And huggell me from the cold 5 1

*Tis nothing but a shephard: 's boy,

A driving his sheep to the fold*

“ Is not thy hawk upon a perch ?

Thy steed eats oats and hay.

And thou a fair lady in thine arms, —

And would St thou.be away ?

With that my lord Barnard came to the door.

And lit a stone upon ;

He plucked out three silver keys,

And h^ open: 'd the doors each one.

He lifted up*the coverlet.

He lifted up the sheet ;

“ How now, how now, thou little Musgrave, Doest thou find my lady sweet ? ”

** I find her sweet,” quoth little Musgrave,

“ The more : 'tis to my pain ;

I would gladly give three hundred pounds That I were on yonder plain.”

** Arise, arise, thou little Musgrave,

And put thy clothes bn ;

It shall ne: 'er be Said in my country,

I have killed a naked man.

"I have two swords in one scabbard,

, •Full dear they cost my purse ; j And thou shalt have the best of them,

And I will have the worse.”

The first stroke that little Musgrave stroke.

He hurt Lord Barnard sore ;

The next stroke that Lord Barnard stroke,

Little Musgrave ne'er struck more.

With that bespake this fair lady,

In bed whereas she lay ;

Although thou rt dead, thou little Musgrave, Yet I for thee will pray j

And wish well to thy soul wSl I,

So long as I ha\e life ;

So will I not for thee, Barnard,

Although I am thy wedded wife.”

He cut her paps from off her breast.

Great pity it was to see,

That some drops of this lady: 's heart's blood Ran trickling down her knee.

Woe worth you, woe worth, my merry men all, You were ne er bbrn for my good Why did you not offer to ^ay my hand.

When ye saw me wax so wood!

“ For I have slain the bravest sir knight That ever rode on steed ; ,

So have I done the fairest lady That ever did womans deed.

A grave, a grave,” Lord Barnard cried, To put these lovers in ;

But lay my lady on the upper hand,

For she came of the better kin.”

LITTLE MUSGRAVE AND LADY BARNARD

A broadside printed for Henry Gosson (C) appears to be the earliest impression known, but it has not so good a text as A. The ballad is quoted in Beaumont and Fletcher: 's Knight of the Burning Pestle (about 1611), act v, scene 3, and in other old plays. : ' Little Musgrave: ' is entered to Francis Coules in the Stationers: ' Registers, June 24, 1630.

'Little Musgrave and the Lady Barnard.' a. Wit Restord, 1658, in the reprint : ' Facetiz,: ' London, 1817, 1, 298. b. Wit and Drollery, 1682, p. 81.

1 As it fell one holy-day,  
Hay downe  
As many be in the yeare,
When young men and maids together did goe,  
Their mattins and masse to heare,  

2 Little Musgrave came to the churchdore;  
The preist was at private masse;  
But he had more minde of the faire women. 
Then he had of our lady['s] grace.

3 The one of them was clad in green,  
Another was clad in pall,  
And then came in my lord Bernard's wife,  
The fairest amonst them all.

4 She cast an eye on Little Musgrave,  
As bright as the summer sun;  
And then bethought this Little Musgrave,  
This lady's heart have I woonn.

5 Quoth she, I have loved thee, Little Musgrave,  
Full long and many a day;  
'So have I loved you, fair lady,  
Yet never word durst I say.'

6 'I have a bower at Buckelsfordbery,  
Full daintyly it is deight;  
If thou wilt wend thither, thou Little Musgrave,  
Thou's lig in mine armes all night.'

7 Quoth he, I thank yee, faire lady,  
This kindnes thou showest to me;  
But whether it be to my weal or woe,  
This night I will lig with thee.

8 With that he heard, a little tynë page,  
By his ladye's coach as he ran:  
'All though I am my ladye's foot-page,  
Yet I am Lord Barnard's man.

9 'My lord Barnard shall knowe of this,  
Whether I sink or swim;'  
And ever where the bridges were broake  
He laid him downe to swimme.

10 'A sleepe or wake, thou Lord Barnard,  
As thou art a man of life,  
For Little Musgrave is at Bucklesfordbery,  
A bed with thy own wedded wife.'

11 'If this be true, thou little tinny page,  
This thing thou tellest to me,  
Then all the land in Bucklesfordbery  
I freely will give to thee.

12 'But if it be a ly, thou little tinny page,  
This thing thou tellest to me,  
On the hyest tree in Bucklesfordbery  
Then hanged shalt thou be.'

13 He called up his merry men all:  
'Come saddle me my steed;  
This night must I to Buckellsfordbery,  
For I never had greater need.'

14 And some of them whistld, and some of them sung,  
And some these words did say,  
And ever when my lord Barnard's horn blew,  
'Away, Musgrave, away!'

15 'Methinks I hear the thresel-cock,  
Methinks I hear the jaye;  
Methinks I hear my lord Barnard,  
And I would I were away.'

16 'Lye still, lye still, thou Little Musgrave,  
And huggell me from the cold;  
'T is nothing but a shephard's boy,  
A driving his sheep to the fold.

17 'Is not thy hawke upon a perch?  
Thy steed eats oats and hay;  
And thou a fair lady in thine armes,  
And wouldst thou bee away?'

18 With that my lord Barnard came to the dore,  
And lit a stone upon;  
He plucked out three silver keys,  
And he opend the dores each one.

19 He lifted up the coverlett,  
He lifted up the sheet:  
'How now, how now, thou Littell Musgraye,  
Doest thou find my lady sweet?'

20 'I find her sweet,' quoth Little Musrave,  
'The more 't is to my paine;
I would gladly give three hundred pounds  
That I were on yonder plaine.'

21 'Arise, arise, thou Littell Musgrave,  
And put thy clothés on;  
It shall nere be said in my country  
I have killed a naked man.

22 'I have two swords in one scabberd,  
Full deere they cost my purse;  
And thou shalt have the best of them,  
And I will have the worse.'

23 The first stroke that Little Musgrave stroke,  
He hurt Lord Barnard sore;  
The next stroke that Lord Barnard stroke,  
Little Musgrave nere struck more.

24 With that bespake this faire lady,  
In bed whereas she lay:  
'Although thou'rt dead, thou Little Musgrave,  
Yet I for thee will pray.

25 'And wish well to thy soule will I,  
So long as I have life;  
So will I not for thee, Barnard,  
Although I am thy wedded wife.'

26 He cut her paps from off her brest;  
Great pitty it was to see  
That some drops of this ladie's heart's blood  
Ran trickling downe her knee.

27 'Woe worth you, woe worth, my mery men all,  
You were nere borne for my good;  
Why did you not offer to stay my hand,  
When you see me wax so wood?

28 'For I have slaine the bravest sir knight  
That ever rode on steed;  
So have I done the fairest lady  
That ever did woman's deed.

29 'A grave, a grave,' Lord Barnard cryd,  
'To put these lovers in;  
But lay my lady on the upper hand,  
For she came of the better kin.'

2 'If it be trew, thou litle foote-page,

Then all my lands in Buckle[s ]feildberry  
I'le freely giue to thee.

3 'But if this be a lye, thou little footpage,

4 Saies, Vpp and rise, my merrymen all,  
And saddle me my good steede,  
For I must ride to Bucklesfeildberry;  
God wott I had neuer more need!

5 But some they whistled, and some thé sunge,  
And some they thus cold say,  
When euer as Lord Barnetts horne blowes,  
'Away, Musgreue, away!'

And huddle me from the cold,  
For it is but some sheaperds boy,  
Is whistling sheepe ore the mold.

8 'Is not thy hauke vpon a pearch,  
Thy horsse eating corne and hay?  
And thou, a gay lady in thine armes,  
And yett thou wold goe away!'

9 By this time Lord Barnett was come to the dore,  
And light vpon a stone,  
And he pulled out three silver kayes,  
And opened the dores euery one.

10 And first he puld the couering downe,  
And then puld downe the sheete;  
Saies, How now? How now, Litle Musgreue?  
Dost find my gay lady sweet?

11 'I find her sweete,' saies Litle Musgreue,  
'The more is my greefe and paine;'

'Soe haue I done the fairest lady  
That euer wore womans weede.

13 'Soe haue I done a heathen child,  
Which ffull sore greiueth mee,  
For which Ile repent all the dayes of my life,  
And god be with them all three!'

Reliques of Ancient English Poetry: Consisting of Old Heroic Ballads, Songs ...
by Thomas Percy

Publication date 1857 (lots of other versions...)

pp. 106-

XL

This ballad is ancient, and has been popular ; we find it quoted in many old plays. See Beaum. and Fletcher's Knight of the Burning Pestle, 4to. 1613, act v. The Varieiie, a comedy, 12mo, 1649, act iv., &c. In Sir William Davenant's play. The Witts, act iii., a gallant thus boasts of himself:

"Limber and Bound! besides I sing Musgrave,  
And for Chevy-chace no lark comes near me."

In the Pepys Collection, vol. iii. p. 314, is an imitation of this old song, in thirty-three stanzas, by a more modern pen, with many alterations, but evidently for the worse.

This is given from an old printed copy in the British Museum, with corrections ; some of which are from a fragment in the Editor's folio MS. It is also printed in Dryden's Collection of Miscellaneous Poems.

As it fell out on a highe bolye daye,

As many bee in the yeare, When young men and maides together do goe,

Their masses and mattins to heare,

Little Musgrave came to the church door, 5

The priest was at the mass ; But be had more mind of the fine women,

Then he had of our Ladyes grace.


LADT BARNARD. 107

And some of them were clad in greene,

And others were clad in pall ; 10

And then came in my lord Bamardes wife, The fairest among them all.

. Shee cast an eye on little Musgrave As bright as the summer sunne :

then bethought him little Musgrave, 15 This ladyes heart I have wonne.

Quoth she, I have loved thee, little Musgrave,

Fulle long and manye a daye. So have I loved you, ladye faire,

Yet word I never durst saye. 20

1 have a bower at Bucklesford-Bury ',

Full daintilye bedight. If thoult wend thither, my little Musgrave, Thoust lig in mine armes all night.

Quoth bee, I thanke yee, ladye faire, 25

This kindness yee shew to mee ; And whether it be to my weale or woe.

This night will I lig with thee.

All this beheard a litle foot-page, By his ladyes coach as he ranne : 30

1 Baddefield-berry. fol. MS

Quoth he, thoughe I am my ladyes page, Yet I me my lord Barnardes manne.

My lord Barnard shall knowe of this,

Although I lose a limhe. And ever whereas the bridges were broke, 35

He layd him downe to swimme.]

Asleep or awake, thou lord Barnard,

As thou art a man of life, Lo! this same night at Bucklesford-Bury

Little Musgrave's abed with thy wife. 40

If it be trew, thou litle foote-page, .

This tale diou hast told to mee. Then all my lands in Bucklesford-Bury

I freelye will give to thee.

But and it be a lye, thou litle foot-page, 45

This tale thou hast told to mee. On the highest tree in Bucklesford-Bury

All hanged shalt thou bee.

Rise up, rise up, my merry men all.

And saddle me my good steede ; 50

This night must I to Bucklesford-bury ;

God wott, I had never more neede.

Then some they whistled, and some they sang, And some did loudlye saye,

L


LADT BARNARDr 109

Whenever lord Bamardes home it blewe, 55

Awaye, Musgrave, away.

Methinkes I heare the tlirostle cocke,

Methinkes I heare the jaye, Methinkes I heare lord Bamards home ;

I would I were awaye. 60

Lye still, lye still, thou little Musgrave,

And huggle me from the cold ; For it is but some shephardes boye

A whistling hiis sheepe to the fold.

Is not thy hawke upon the peavche, 65

Thy horse eating come and haye ? And thou a gaye lady within thine armes;

And wouldst thou be awaye ?

By this lord Barnard was come to the dore. And lighted upon a stone : 70

And he pulled out three silver keyes. And opened the dores eche one.

He lifted up the coverlett.

He lifted up the sheete ; How now, how now, thou little Musgrave, 75

Dost find my gaye ladye sweete ?

y. 64, Is whi&tHng sheepe ore tke mold. fbl. MSi.


I find her sweete, quoth little Musgr^ve,

The more is my griefe and paine ; Ide gladlye give three hundred poundes

That 1 were on yonder plaine. 80

Arise, arise, thou little Musgrave,

And put thy cloathes nowe on, It shall never be said in my countree.

That I killed a naked man.

I have two swordes in one scabb^rde, 85

Full deare they cost my purse ; And thou shalt have the best of them.

And I will have the worse.

The first stroke that little Musgrave strucke, He hurt lord Barnard sore ; 90

The next stroke that lord Barnard strucke, Little Musgrave never strucke more.

With that bespake the ladye &ire,

In bed whereas she laye, Althoughe thou art dead, my little Musgrave, 95

Yet for thee I will praye :

And wishe well to thy soule will I,

So long as I have life ; So will I not do for thee, Barnard,

Thoughe I am thy wedded wife. 100


LADY BARNARD. Ill

He cut her pappes from off her brest ;

Great pitye it was to see, The drops of this fair ladyes bloode

Run trickling downe her knee.

Wo worth, wo worth ye, my merrye men all, 105 You never were borne for my goode :

Why did you not offer to stay my hande, When you sawe me wax so woode ?

For I have slaine the fairest sir knighte.

That ever rode on a steede ; 110

So have I done the fairest lady, That ever ware womans weede.

A grave, a grave, lord Barnard cryde.

To putt these lovers in ; But lay my ladye o* the upper hande, 115

For shee comes o' the better kin.

fg* That the more modern copy is to be dated about the middle of the last century, will be readily conceived from the tenour of the concluding stanza, viz.

** This sad Mischief by Lust was wrought : Then let us call for Grace, That we may shun the wicked vice. And fly from Sin a-pace"
