"GONE WITH THE FAIRIES"

A good deal of excitement has been caused in the district about Drangan and Cloneen by the "mysterious disappearance" of a labourer's wife, who lived with her husband, a farm labourer, in that part of the country. The poor woman had been ill for some time, and a few days ago she told her husband that if he did not do something for her by a certain time "she would have to be going." An old woman who had been nursing the sick woman was sitting up with her as usual one night last week, and, as she puts it, the invalid was "drawn" away. Search has been made everywhere, and the police have been communicated with, but up to this afternoon no trace of the missing woman has been discovered. The country-people entertain the opinion that she has "gone with the fairies!"

The Mysterious Disappearance of a Woman

Nine Persons Arrested and Remanded.

A telegram received in Clonmel last evening announces that the body of the missing woman, Mrs Cleary, has been found in Drangan police sub-district.

On Wednesday evening the authorities made the first public move in connection with this case, when nine men and one woman were arrested and brought before Colonel Evanson, R M, and Mr W Tennant, D L, in Fethard, where after a number of informations were sworn they were sent on to Clonmel. Here they were brought before Mr T C Grubb, J P, and the informations having been read, they were remanded for eight days. The defendants are Michl Cleary, Patk Boland, John Dunne, Patk Kennedy, James Kennedy, Michl Kennedy, Wm Kennedy, Wm Ahern, Mary Kennedy. and Denis Ganey.

Informations were sworn by Wm Simmons, caretaker of an evicted farm at Cloneen; Johanna Burke, Rathkenny; and D J Wansbury. It appeared from the sworn evidence that the woman was treated under the instructions of the man Ganey, who is known as an herb or fairy doctor, and that the other defendants had held her over the fire and forced her to swallaw a noxious fluid. It appeared from the sworn evidence that they forcibly held her on the bed and compelled her to drink the stuff alluded to above, and it is said that in consequence of this she left the house. The first nine-named defendants are charged with having unlawfully beaten and ill-treated Bridget Cleary and caused her great bodily harm. The man Ganey is charged with procuring such an offence to be committed.

BARBARISM IN TIPPERARY

HORRIBLE SCENE OF SUPERSTITION AND CRUELTY.

A SICK WOMAN TORTURED AS A WITCH.

Clonmel, Saturday.

The sensation caused by the mysterious disappearance of a sick woman named Cleary has been the discovery of her dead body yesterday buried in a dyke on an evicted farm in Drangan police district, about a quarter of mile from her own home. She was just a week missing, and the police and others were searching for her vainly all the time until yesterday, when a police constable found her body buried about two feet in the boggy bottom of the dyke, her only covering being a chemise and some old bags. On turning the body it was found that one side was dreadfully burned from the face down to the legs. The police took charge of the remains once, but left them, as found, in the custody of a special guard all nignt. After the discovery of the body a woman named Burke, who had been caring Mrs Cleary while sick, was taken in custody by police. The deceased was about 27 years of age. Her husband is a cooper by trade. Her maiden name was Boland. The sworn statement of the principal Crown witness, William Simpson, of Bellyvadha, who lives close to the Clearys, reads like a page from a fairy tale. He states on oath—I am in the employment of Thomas Lindsay, and on the night of the 14th instant, accompanied by my wife, between nine and ten o'clock, I went to the house of Patrick Boland where the Clearys also resided. When we arrived close to the house we met Mrs Johanna Burks and inquired how was Mrs Cleary who was ill. She said they were giving her some herbs just then which they got from Denis Ganey, over the mountaln, and that no person would be let in for some time. We then proceeded to the window of the house, which is a new labourers' cottage. In one of the front rooms I heard shouting—"Take it, you b————, you old faggot, or we will kill you." The shutters of the window were closed and the door locked. After a short time the door was opened and I and my wife and Johanna Burke went into the house. I noticed the room I had heard the shouts from. I saw there John Dunne, P Kennedy, J Kennedy, Wm Kennedy holding Mrs Cleary on the bed. She was on her back. Her husband Michael Cleary was standing by the bedside. I heard him call for (mentioning a noxious fluid), and he said "Throw it on." It was brought by Mary Kennedy. Michael Cleary had a saucepan in his hand at the time. It would appear as if they threw the liquid on the woman. Wm Ahearn was holding a candle. P Boland, M Kennedy, Johanna Burke, and Kate Burke, a child, were in the room. I saw Mrs Cleary struggling on the bed, and say "Leave me alone." I then saw her husband give her some liquid off a spoon, and heard some one say it was herbs. She was held down at the time by force, and one of those present held his hand across her mouth, and others held her down for ten minutes after she got the herbs. A man at each side of the bed kept the body swinging about the whole time. She screamed horribly, and they cried out, "Come home, Bridget Boland (Mrs Cleary's maiden name). From what I could learn, they thought Mrs Cleary was a witch, and endeavoured to send her out of the house by torturing her body. Some time after I saw them take her out of the bed, carry her to the kitchen fire, and hold her over it. In a short time I could see her raised on the bars of the grate over the fire. Those who placed her over the fire were John Dunne, Patrick, William, and James Kennedy. I saw some red marks on her. One of those present said he had to use a red hot poker on her to make her take the medicine. I saw some marks on her neck. Her husband put some questions to her at the fire, asking if she was his wife, and after she had answered the questions they put her back on the bed. I remained in the house till 6 o'clock in morning, when I went home. I saw her again about midday on tba 15th in bed in her house. She was not quite sane at the time. I have known her for the past four years, and never knew anything to be the matter with her. I saw her frequently. She lived about 200 yards from me. I was disgusted at the operation. The door was locked, I could not leave the house. On the night of the 15th Bridget Cleary left her home. She has not since been found.

Mrs Johanna Burke gave corroberative evidence, and added that when Mrs Cleary was taken off the fire a clean chemise, which witness had aired, was put on her instead of the old one. There was a mark on Mrs Cleary's forehead and another on her neck. On the night of the 15th witness, who was minding Mrs Cleary, was again in her room. Mrs Cleary was raving, and after some time got up and dressed and sat by the fire, but returned to bed again. Witness went out for some sticks, and when she returned met Mrs Cleary at the doorway going out with her nigntdress on. Witness tried to step her, but failed, and she did not see Mrs Cleary after.

Two of the persons above-mentioned are in prison on remand. Mrs Burke was arrested last night, making the eleventh arrest.

BEFORE THE FINDING OF THE BODY.

Before finding of the body of the murdered woman the ten prisoners were charged with having assaulted and ill-treated her and caused her actual bodily harm, and they were brought before the magistrates on this charge at the Town Hall, Clonmel, on Thursday.

In the case against: Denis Ganey, Mr Wansbrough, D I, when applying for a warrant for his arrest, made an information before Col Evanson, R M, and Mr Tennant, at Fethard, on the 20tb inst, which was now read. In it he stated—"I have just and reasonable gronnda for believing that the ill-treatment which Bridget Cleary was subjected to was in administering to her herbs prepared for her by Denis Geary, of Kyleatlea, and that it was by his instructions she was placed over a fire, and wounded and otherwise ill-treated. I charge Denis Ganey with causing Bridget Cleary to be ill treated, and great actual bodily harm done to her."

Mr Casey, C P S (to the prisoner Michael Cleary, husband of Bridget Cleary)—You have heard the deposition and informations which have been read, do you wish to ask Mr Wansbrough any questions?

Cleary at first remained silent, and the presiding magistrate, Mr Grubb, repeated the question.

Cleary— All I have to say is that I would not ill-treat my wife.

Mr Casey—That is not a question but a statement. Have you any question to put to the District-Inspector? Cleary replied that he had not, and was farther understood to say that it was he who had gone for the man Denis Ganey.

Patrick Boland, (father of Bridget Cleary) was next asksd a similar question, and he said—I don't know: I have nothing to say about my daughter.

John Dunne, upon being questioned, said— The statement have to make is——

Casey—If you wish to put any question to the officer do so. This is not the time to make any statement.

Dunne and also two others of the accused (Patrick Kennedy and James Kennedy) declined to put any questions.

The next prisoner, Michael Kennedy, when the usual inquiry was put to him, said—I wish to know why I should be remanded when I was only ten minutes in the house. I did not wish to do her any harm.

Mr Wansbrougb, D I—You are charged with being present in the house, and your question simply proves that you were there.

Michael Kennedy—I did not remain there.

Three others of the defendants—William Kennedy, William Ahearne, and Mary Kennedy (a rather middle-aged woman) declined to ask any questions.

The last of the accused, Denis Ganey, when questioned, asked—Did he see me? Does he say that I assisted in doing away with the woman.

The following passage was read for the accused from one of the informations sworn by Wansbrough—"I believe that the illtreatment which Bridget CUary was subjected to was in administering herbs prepared for her by Denis Ganey, and that it was by his instructions she was ill-treated."

Ganey—Did he hear me? Does he swear that I instructed the people to do so? What grounds has he for charging me?

Mr Wansbrough, D I—The two informations which have been sworn, and one of the accused actually states that he went for you.

Ganey—What grounds has he for believing that I gave instructions? When did he see or hear of my being there, or was I there at all?

Mr Wansbrough—I refer to the information of William Simpson, one of the persons present upon the occasion with which we are dealing, which uses the following words—"We met Mrs Johanna Burke, and we asked from her how was Mrs Cleary, and she said they were giving her at this time herbs they got from Graney over the mountain." I also refer to the admission made by Michael Cleary a moment ago in the presence of the court, "It was I went for Ganey."

Michael Cleary—I went to him.

Wansbrougn (addressing the court)— Your worship, the unfortunate woman Bridget Cleary is still unable to be found, though every search has been made for her by the police. The ponds in the neighbourhood have been dragged, and other means have been taken to find out what has become of her, but as yet to no effect. Under these circumstances have only to apply to this court to have all the accused remanded to prison, pending her discovery, and ascertaining the condition in which she is.

Grubb—I don't see why your application should be refused in the absence of the woman, who is yet missing. It would be a great satisfaction if she were discovered. This, I must say, is one of the most melancholy cases that have occurred in this neighbourhood for a very long time.

Patrick Boland—I have three more persons, and they can say that she was strong night she went away; she got up and dressed.

Mr Grubb—Where is she now?

Boland—I don't know. She was there on Friday night. The prisoner John Dunne made a similar statement, and mentioned the names of a number of persons who would prove she was there late that night.

The application for a remand was then granted.

The prisoner Ganey asked to be admitted to bail, but his application was refused by the court.

All the male prisoners were then removed in custody to Cloomel, and the women to Limerick Female Prison.

THE INQUEST.

This afternoon Coroner Shee and a jury held an inquest at Clonmel on the body of the woman Cleary.

Addressing the jury, the coroner said that certainly if all he had heard about the case were true this was one of the most frightful cases that had occurred in country for years. Amongst the Hottentots they would not expect to hear of such a shocking occurrence. He was happy to tell the jury that he hoped to save them the trouble and anxiety of inquiring into this case, as he thought the ends of justice would be met by merely ascertainmg the cause of death and leaving the magistrates to deal with the other aspect of the case, as there were several persons in gaol connected with the affair.

The foreman agreed with the coroner.

D J Heard—I think evidence as to the cease of death will be sufficient.

Evidence was then given by the police constable as to the finding and identification of the body.

Dr Wm Crean, Fetbard, was examined, and stated—I was called to see the sick woman on the 11th inst. I was not able to go to see her until the 13th inst. I went to her residence on that morning. I found her simply suffering from nervous excitement. She was in bed. She had also slight inflammation of the breathing tubes of the lungs, or bronchitis. I could see nothing in her case that would cause death. I did not see the slightest danger. I prescribed, and afterwards, the same morning gave the medicine to her husband. I had no anxiety whatever about her case. I did not see her alive afterwards. I attended on a dispensary ticket, and did not deem it necessary to renew my visit. To-day I saw her dead body, and assisted Dr Hefferman in making a *post mortem* examination, the result of which will be found in our joint informations.

The joint informations of Crean and Dr W K Hefferman stated—We have made a *post mortem* examination ot the deceased. We found the right hip and thigh and portion of the  abdomen charred and burned, with the internal organs protruding through the burned apertures. The right hand was also burned, the fingers charred and contracted. We also found the same condition of burning on the left side and back of the hip joint, but not so severe. Tne left hand was also burned: the fingers charred. The muscles on the lower end of the spine were chaired and burned, and the bones exposed. There was gold ear-ring on the left ear. What remained of the body seems to be well nourished. There was an abrasion on the inner side of the lips at the right side of the mouth, and the tongue at that side was slightly lacerated. On opening the neck we found the tissues slightiy discoloured, but there were no great marks of violence. On removing the scalp we found extravasation of blood on the top of the head. We found the vessels of the brain congested, but no injury to the brain substance. The lungs were slightly congested, and the left lung adhering to the chest wall. The spleen was ruptured, We removed the stomach, and found it healthy in appearance. We believe she died from shock caused by the burns. We believe death resulted from them. No living person could exist from the severe burns. The abdomen was burnt, and the contents exposed. The internal organs were sufficiently healthy to carry on life. The rupture of the spleen might have occurred after death. We should say death must have occurred very soon or immediately after the burns or in the process.

Coroner—Gentlemen, you can have no doubt she died from the burns, but we have no evidence showing how or by whom the burns were caused.

THE VERDICT

The jury found that "Deceased was found dead on lands of Tullycussane on Friday, 22nd March, 1895, and we find that death was by extensive burns, how or by whom caused we have no evidence to shew. We futher find that deceased was alive in her own house on 13th March, 1895."

THE "WITCH" OF CLONMEL.

FUNERAL OF THE VICTIM.

The funeral of Bridget Cleary, who, as alleged, was burned to death by her husband near Clonmel, county Tipperary, in the superstitious belief that she had been carried off by the fairies and evil spirit put into possession of her body, took place at Cloveen on Thursday afternoon, and was boycotted by all her relations and neighbours. Not one civilian attended the burial, and the rites of sepulture were performed by four police-constables. There was no hearse, and the coffin was borne by common car from Fethard. The significance this will be understood when it is remembered that the Irish peasantry regard a funeral not only as an expression of respect for the deceased and sympathy with the family, but as invested with a certain degree of sanctity. The fact is, however, that the people believe—or, perhaps, with a view to the defence of the prisonars, affect to believe—that the real Bridget Cleary will come back, riding on a white horse sent by the fairies, and that if they can succeed in cutting the reins of the horse they will secure her. With this object, there are, it is stated, on the watch on the mountains, one of whom is specially provided with sharp knife to cut the reins. The magisterial inquiry into the occurrence is still proceeding. In addition to the evidence previously given, a daughter of the principal witness, an intelligent child named Kate Burke, described as an eyewitness of the scene, was examined, and corroborated in every detail the statements of her mother. The prisoners declined to ask the witness any questions, but most them said that she was quite right in what she had stated. The accused persons were again remanded.

"WITCH-BURNING" CASE. COMMITTAL OF THE PRISONERS. At the resumed hearing on Saturday of the charges against the prisoners accused of burning Bridget Cleary Clonmel, the evidence of the deceased woman's father incriminating the husband was read over. Cleary meanwhile became terribly excited, denying that the fathers evidence was true. He called the other prisonere a "rotten crowd," and said that if he did not get justice there he would get it in heaven.

The prisoners, Mary Kennedy, John Dunne, and Pat Kennedy made statements supporting what had been said by the father. They declared that Cleary went out and dug a hole as a grave. Pat Kennedy at first refused to help, but on being threatened with a knife consented. They rolled the body in a sheet and bag and put it in hole, Cleary forcing down the body with his foot. Next day he said to John Dunne it was not his wife, but a witch he had burned.

During the making of the several statements the other prisoners stood apart from Cleary in the dock.

All the prisoners were committed for trial the capital charge.

"R.A.," writing the *Spectator*, referring to the above case, maintains that Mrs. Cleary did not meet with her end owing to the belief witchcraft or demoniacal expression, which has real hold in Ireland. "She perished," "R, A." says, "owing to the belief in the fairies.

"In Munster, when a child appears delicate, or a young woman consumptive or hysterical, the conclusion often is that the child or the woman has bean carried off by the fairies, to be made playmate or nurse to the young fairies, and that a fairy substitute resembling the person taken away is deposited in their place, which gradually declines, and ultimately dies. The belief is that if the changeling be tortured by fire its fairy parents will hear its cries, rush to its aid, carry it to fairyland, and at the same moment restore the real person, who will be found sleeping calmly the bed.

"Cleary and 'the neighbours' evidently believed that the being they tortured was not Cleary's wife, but a changeling. He addressed her, 'In the name of God, are you Bridget Boland?' (her maiden name), believing that thus adjured the being would confess it was fairy. Again, after the burning, many of the men of the locality sa£ up all night in a 'fort' (earth embankment of ancient Irish village), armed with black-handled knives. These poor people thought that fairy procession would pass by, that in the midst would be Mrs. Cleary riding on a grey horse, and that if anyone rushed forward and cut her bonds with a black-handled knife (a potent weapon against all evil spirits), she would at once be restored to the world. In the 'Tales of Terror and Wonder' it was thus that Fair Janet rescued Tam Lin from the fairies. She sat at Giles Cross on Halloween, at the 'murk and midnight hour', when she sees the fairy host go by:

First she let the black pass by,  
And next she let the brown,  
But quickly ran to the milk-white steed.  
And drew its rider down.

Thus Fair Janet rescued Lin; thus the poor dwellers on the slope of Saere-na-mon (the 'Witches Hill,' a haunted mountain) believed that they would rescue Bridget.

Clonmel Chronicle - Saturday 23 March 1895

EXTRAORDINARY AND DREADFUL OCCURRENCE IN CO. TIPPERARY.

MYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCE OF A WOMAN.

In our last issue we referred briefly to the mysterious disappearance of a woman named Bridget Cleary, wife of a man named Michael Cleary, residing at Ballyvadlea — a remote, lonely, and isolated district lying a short distance from Cloneen, between that village and Mullinahone. The wildest rumours were in circulation about the matter since her disappearance first became known; and as day after day passed without any intelligence of her whereabouts, the excitement became the more intense and widespread, until at length the entire affair became the one prevailing topic of conversation. It appears that the woman was believed by some parties to have been possessed by an evil spirit, the consequence of which was that she was subjected to the treatment that resulted in her disappearance. Meanwhile the police, under the direction of District-Inspector J. A. Wansbrough, of Carrick-on-Suir—the officer of the district in which the deceased and her husband resided with her father, Patrick Boland—proceeded to investigate the circumstances connected with the affair, with the result that informations were sworn before Mr. W. W. Tennant, J.P., of Ballinard Castle, by William Simpson, caretaker, living at Cloneen, and a woman named Burke; and on Wednesday an information was made by Mr. Wansbrough, before Colonel Evanson, R.M., and Mr. Tennant, when warrants were issued for the arrest of ten persons—nine of whom were charged with having been implicated, severally and jointly, in the ill-treatments of the woman; and the remaining prisoner with having caused the offence to be committed.

MAGISTERIAL INQUIRY AT THE TOWN HALL, CLONMEL.

On Thursday last the prisoners were brought up at the Town Hall, and charged with the offence disclosed in the informations upon which their arrest was made. The presiding magistrate was Thomas Cambridge Grubb, Esq. There were also present—County-Inspector T. B. Wilson, District-Inspector J. A. Wansbrough, Carrick-on-Suir, who has charge of the case; District-Inspector H. H. Jones, to watch proceedings on behalf of the Crown. The prosecution was at the suit of Mr. Wansbrough, and the names of the prisoners are—Michael Cleary (husband of the missing woman); Patrick Boland (her father); John Dunne, Patrick James, Michael, and Mary Kennedy, and William Ahearne, who were charged with having, at Ballyvadlea, on the 14th March, jointly and severally unlawfully assaulted and ill-treated Bridget Cleary, causing her actual bodily harm. Denis Ganey, another of the prisoners, was charged with having caused the offence to be committed. The accused were not professionally represented at the inquiry; and the proceedings merely consisted of the reading of the informations in their presence, which had been previously taken, and were now converted into depositions.

Mr. Wansbrough was sworn, and deposed as follows—I refer to the informations of William Simpson and Johanna Burke, sworn respectively on the 18th and 19th March before Mr. Tennant, J.P., in which the defendants and each of them stand charged as stated. I have just and reasonable grounds for believing that I shall be able to produce evidence against the defendants implicating each of them in committing the above offence charged, and I pray they may each be remanded for further examination.

The informations referred to by Mr. Wansbrough were next read—that made by William Simpson was as follows:—

William Simpson, Ballyvadlea, sworn, said—I am in the employment of Thomas Lindsay; on the night of the 14th inst., accompanied by my wife, between 9 and 10 o'clock, I went to the house of Patrick Boland, occupied by him and by Michael and Bridget Cleary (his wife) at Ballyvadlea; I saw Bridget Cleary, who was ill; when we arrived close to the house we met Mrs. Johanna Burke, and inquired from her how was Mrs. Cleary; she said they were given her at this time herbs which they got from Ganey, over the mountain, and that no person would be let in for some time; we then proceeded to the window of the house, which is a new labourer's cottage; in one of the front rooms I heard voices shouting, "Take it, you b——, you old faggot, or we will kill you;" the shutters of the windows were closed, and the door locked; after a short time the door was opened, and I and my wife and Johanna Burke went into the house; I noticed the room I had heard the shouts from; I saw there John Dunne, Patrick Kennedy, James Kennedy, and William Kennedy holding Bridget Cleary on the bed; she was on her back, and had a night dress on her; her husband, Michael Cleary, was standing by the bedside; I heard him call for (mentioning a noxious fluid), and he said, "throw it on"; it was brought by Mary Kennedy; Michael Cleary had a saucepan in his hand at the time; it would appear as if they threw the liquid on the woman; it was thrown on her by some of those present; Wm. Ahearn was present holding a candle; P. Boland, M. Kennedy, and Johanna Burke were in the room, and also Kate Burke, a child; I saw Bridget Cleary struggling on the bed; I heard her speaking; she said "leave me alone;" I then saw her husband give her some liquid off a spoon; I heard some of the parties present say it was herbs; she was held down at the time by force; one of those present kept a hand on her mouth, and others held her down for ten minutes after she got the herbs; a man at each side of the bed kept the body swinging about the whole time; she screamed horrible; they cried out, "Come home, Bridget Boland;" from what I could learn they all thought Mrs. Cleary was a "witch", and endeavoured to hunt her out of the house by torturing her body; some time after I saw them take her out of her bed, carry her to the kitchen fire, and hold her over it; in a short time I could see her body rest on the bars of the grate where the fire was burning; those who placed her over the fire were John Dunne, and Patrick, William, and James Kennedy; I saw some red marks on her forehead; one of those present said they had to use a red poker on her to make her take the medicine; I saw some marks on her neck; her husband put some questions to her at the fire; he asked her if she was his wife; after she answered the questions they put her again into the bed; I remained in the house until 6 o'clock in the morning, when I went home; I saw her again about midday on the 15th inst., in bed in her house; she was not quite the same at the time; I have known her for the past four years, and never knew anything to be the matter with her; I saw her frequently; she lives about 200 yards from me; I was disgusted at the operation; the door was locked, and I could not leave the house; on the night of the 15th Bridget Cleary left her home; she has not since been found.

The information of Johanna Burke was next read, in which she made the following statement:—On the night of the 14th inst., I went to the house where Bridget Cleary resides, to see her, as she was unwell; when I went to the door it was locked; I was outside the window, and heard a voice from the house saying, "You witch or you b———," I don't know which word was used. Wm. Simpson and his wife were with me at the time; after some time the door was opened and I went into the house; I saw Patrick Kennedy, Wm. Kennedy, James Kennedy, and John Dunne; they were holding Bridget Cleary by the hands and feet on the bed; she was on her back; her husband Michael Cleary, was beside the bed; he had a saucepan in his hand; I saw him try to give her something from off a spoon, which he took from the saucepan, and they forced her to take it; some person present called for a liquid; my mother, Mary Kennedy, brought it; I think it was her husband (Cleary) sprinkled and threw it on her; her husband and the four men raised her in the bed; her appearance was changed; they took her to the fire place and held her over the fire, and said if she did not answer her name three times they would burn her; the fire was low at the time; a few sticks were placed across it; she repeated her name after her father, and husband; they stopped at her until she answered her name three times; they then removed her to the bed; some of the women put on a clean chemise on her, which I aired for her; the old one they took off her was of striped flannel; I saw a slight mark on her forehead, near the hair; also a mark on her neck; I left the house next morning about daybreak; I was at the house on the night of the 15th inst.; Bridget Cleary was raving; after some time she got up, dressed, and sat at the fire; she afterwards went to bed; I went out for some sticks; when I returned I met her at the doorway going out against me with her night dress; I endeavoured to hold her and failed; since that time I have not seen her; her husband followed her for some time, and returned; he did not see her; she is missing ever since, and they made search for her.

In the case against Denis Ganey, Mr. Wansbrough, D.I., when applying for a warrant for his arrest, made an information before Col. Evanson, R.M., and Mr. Tennant, at Fethard, on the 20th instant, which was now read. In it he stated—"I have just and reasonable grounds for believing the ill-treatment which Bridget Cleary was subjected to, was in administering to her herbs prepared for her by Denis Ganey, of Kyleatlea, and that it was by his instructions she was placed over a fire, and wounded and otherwise ill-treated. I charge Denis Ganey with causing Bridget Cleary to be ill-treated, and great actual bodily harm done to her."

Mr. Casey, C.P.S. (to the prisoner, Michael Cleary, husband of Bridget Cleary)—You have heard the deposition and informations which have been read, do you wish to ask Mr. Wansbrough any questions?

Cleary at first remained silent, and the presiding magistrate, Mr. Grubb, repeated the question.

Cleary—All I have to say is that I would not ill-treat my wife.

Mr. Casey—That is not a question, but a statement. Have you any question to put to the District-Inspector? Cleary replied that he had not, and further understood to say that it was he who had gone for the man, Denis Ganey.

Patrick Boland (father of Bridget Cleary) was next asked a similar question, and he said—I don't know; I have nothing to say about my daughter.

John Dunne, upon being questioned, said—The statement I have to make is—

Mr. Casey—If you wish to put any question to the officer do so. This is not the time to make any statement.

Dunne and also two others of the accused (Patrick Kennedy and James Kennedy) declined to put any questions.

The next prisoner, Michael Kennedy, when the usual inquiry was put to him, said—I wish to know why I should be remanded when I was only ten minutes in the house. I did not wish to do her any harm.

Mr. Wansbrough, D.I.—You are charged with being present in the house, and your question simply proves that you were there.

Michael Kennedy—I did not remain there.

Three others of the defendants—William Kennedy, William Ahearne, and Mary Kennedy (a rather middle-aged woman) declined to ask any questions.

The last of the accused, Denis Ganey, when questioned, asked—Did he see me? Does he say that I assisted in doing away with the woman?

The following passage was read for the accused from one of the informations sworn by Mr. Wansbrough—"I believe that the ill-treatment which Bridget Cleary was subjected to was in administering herbs prepared for her by Denis Ganey, and that it was by his instructions she was ill-treated."

Ganey—Did he hear me? Does he swear that I instructed the people to do so? What grounds has he for charging me?

Mr. Wansbrough, D.I.—The two informations which have been sworn, and one of the accused actually states that he went for you.

Ganey—What grounds has he for believing that I gave instructions? When did he see or hear of my being there, or was I there at all?

Mr. Wansbrough—I refer to the information of William Simpson, one of the persons present upon the occasion with which we are dealing, in which he uses the following words—"We met Mrs. Johanna Burke, and we asked her how was Mrs. Cleary, and she said they were giving her at this time herbs they got from Ganey over the mountains." I also refer to the admission by Michael Cleary a moment ago in the presence of the court, "It was I went for Ganey."

Michael Cleary—I went to him.

Mr. Wansbrough (addressing the court)—Your worship, the unfortunate woman, Bridget Cleary, is still unable to be found, though every search has been made for her by the police. The ponds in the neighbourhood have been dragged, and other means have been taken to find out what has become of her, but as yet to no effect. Under these circumstances I have only to apply to this court to have all the accused remanded to prison, pending her discovery, and ascertaining the condition in which she is.

Mr. Grubb—I don't see why your application should be refused in the absence of the woman, who is yet missing. It would be a great satisfaction if she were discovered. This, I must say, is one of the most melancholy cases that has occurred in this neighbourhood for a very long time.

Patrick Boland—I have three more persons, and they can say she was strong the night she went away; she got up and dressed.

Mr. Grubb—Where is she now?

Boland—I don't know. She was there on Friday night.

The prisoner John Dunne made a similar statement, and mentioned the names of a number of persons who could prove she was there late that night.

The application for a remand was then granted.

The prisoner Ganey asked to be admitted to bail, but his application was refused by the court.

All the male prisoners were then removed in custody to Clonmel, and the woman to Limerick Female Prison.

DISCOVERY OF THE BODY OF THE MISSING WOMAN.

On yesterday the search for the missing woman, Bridget Cleary, was continued with unabated energy. County Inspector Wilson attended at Cloneen, and District-Inspector Wansbrough, Sergeant Rogers, Mullinahone; Acting-Sergeant Dowling, Clonmel, and a large number of the constabulary continued their re-searches, with the result, as telegraphed to Clonmel last evening, that the remains of the unfortunate woman were discovered buried in a field beside a ditch in the Drangan sub-district, some distance from the village of Cloneen. The police authorities here at once had intelligence of the discovery conveyed to the coroner for the district, James J. Shee, Esq., J.P., who proceeded to-day to the locality for the purpose of holding an inquest. Colonel Evanson, R.M., and the County Inspector also left Clonmel to be present officially during the inquiry.

THE FINDING OF THE BODY—THE INQUEST—TO-DAY.

After the investigation at Clonmel, District-Inspector Wansbrough directed the police at Cloneen, Drangan, and Mullinahone to make diligent search for the missing woman. Parties from the three stations at once proceeded to execute those orders, and about three o'clock on yesterday afternoon Sergeant Rodgers, of Mullinahone, when walking through a swampy bit of land, about a quarter of a mile from Cleary's house, had his attention attracted by broken bushes and freshly-dug earth close to the fence in an angle of the field. Constables Somers, O'Connor and O'Callaghan, who had been searching in the vicinity came to the spot, and in a few minutes the shallow covering of clay was removed, and the body of the unfortunate woman, Bridget Cleary, revealed. It presented a most terrible appearance. There was no clothing, with the exception of a pair of black stockings. The back and lower part of the remains were terribly burned. The head was enveloped in a sack, and an old sheet was rolled round the rest of the body. The hole in which it had been deposited was only about three feet in length. The body was on the back, and partly on the left side, and the limbs were cramped up. The arms were folded across the breast. The matter was at once, as already mentioned, reported to the coroner by the police authorities, and the body remained in charge of a party of police at the place where it was found.

Most extraordinary and almost incredible reports are current in the locality with respect to the occurrence. The whole matter is being investigated by the authorities, and on the resumption of the magisterial inquiry in Clonmel, very sensational evidence will, we understand, be forthcoming.

The inquest was opened to-day by James J. Shee Esq., J.P., Coroner, in a vacant house belonging to Mr. John Anglim, at Ballyvadlea, some short distance from the residence of the Clearys.

The following farmers residing in the district were sworn on the jury:—Thomas Ryan (foreman); John Anglim, Maurice O'Brien, Joseph Maher, Michael Slattery, jun; James Morries, Michael Slattery, sen; Edward O'Brien, Philip Slattery, William Stokes, Francis Bradshaw, Patrick White, Thomas Croke, and Thomas Cahill.

Mr. Heard, Divisional Commissioner, Kilkenny, County Inspector Wilson, Clonmel; Colonel Evanson, R.M., Mr. W. W. Tennant, J.P., District Inspector Wansbrough, Carrick-on-Suir, and District Inspector R. H. B. Huddy, Kilkenaule, Sergeant Rodgers and Constable O'Connor, Mullinahone, Acting-Sergeant Dowling, and Constable Somers, Cloneen; Acting-Sergeant Egan and Constable Callaghan, Drangan, were present at the inquest.

Dr. W. K. Hefferson, Killenaule, and Dr. W. Crean, Fethard, were in attendance, and at the request of the coroner and jury, proceeded to make a *post mortem* examination while the other evidence was being taken.

The Coroner, addressing the jury, said they had been sworn to inquire how the deceased came by her death. He did not know anything about the case, and had read nothing about it in the newspapers. He knew nothing of the circumstances except what he had heard that morning, and certainly if what he had heard was true it was one of the most frightful things that had occurred in this country for years. Amongst Hottentots one would not expect to hear of such an occurrence. He was happy to tell the jury that he would save them the trouble and anxiety of inquiring into it, because his idea was that they would fulfill the ends of justice so far as their inquiry was concerned by ascertaining the cause of death. There were some eight or nine persons in prison charged with an offence upon the unfortunate woman. He would not like to hold an inquiry behind the backs of persons charged with a crime, and that was another reason why he did not intend to ask them to go into the matter. There was no doubt that the jury had power to call on him to examine witnesses, and if they did so, he was prepared to call them. They would have evidence of identification, and then the evidence of the doctors who were holding a *post mortem* examination. If the jury wished he would go further, but he thought it would be better not.

Foreman—I think so, too, sir.

Coroner—You will now view the body, which has been brought over here.

The jury then proceeded to an outhouse, where the body lay, and formally viewed it. It was wrapped up in the sheet in which it was when discovered, and presented a most ghastly appearance—the back and lower part of the body was severely burned; the head and face were apparently uninjured. The features were those of a young woman, and were much distorted.

When the jury returned to the house, County Inspector Wilson and Divisional Commissioner Heard arrived from Clonmel.

The Coroner, addressing the latter, said this was a most frightful and sad occurrence which had taken place. He had advised the jury merely to go into the cause of death, taking the evidence of identification and the evidence of the doctors. If Mr. Heard was satisfied he would leave the rest of the investigation to him and to Colonel Evanson.

Mr. Heard—All the jury have to do is to find the cause of death.

Constable Samuel Somers, Cloneen, was the first witness examined by the coroner. He said—I have this day viewed the body of Bridget Cleary, now lying dead at Ballyvadlea in this county; she was married to Michael Cleary, cooper, and they resided in this townland; she was about 26 years of age; I knew her for about three years.

Was she a healthy woman? She was, sir; I saw her last about a month or six weeks ago.

Have you any doubt that the remains you have viewed this day are those of Bridget Cleary? No doubt, sir.

Was it reported to you that she had been missing for some time? It was reported at Cloneen on the 16th inst. that she was missing—that she had gone away from her father's house; we had been searching for her up to yesterday; I was out with another constable on yesterday, and I saw Sergeant Rodgers and Acting-Sergeant Dowling, who were searching too; about 3 o'clock I observed them standing in an angle of a field; we faced for them at once; I saw two constables digging in a dyke, and after a short time they exhumed the body of the deceased, Bridget Cleary; it had the appearance of being some days dead, and there were burned, charred marks on it.

By the Foreman—How did you identify her? By her features.—They were not injured? Her features were perfect.

Coroner—Is there any evidence as to the date of the woman's death?

District-Inspector Wansbrough—I have none at present, sir.

Coroner—I believe all the people who were in the house are in gaol?

District-Inspector Wansbrough—Dr. Crean, who was attending the deceased, may be able to give you some information. I believe he visited her once.

Coroner—Would you, Colonel Evanson, wish to ask any questions?

Colonel Evanson—No; I am merely here in connection with the inquiry which I am conducting myself.

Coroner—We will all be satisfied with your inquiry.

Dr. Heffernan and Dr. Crean having conducted the *post mortem*, their evidence was next taken.

Dr. Crean was first examined. He stated, in reply to the Coroner—I knew the deceased. Were you called to see her recently? I was on the 11th March, but I was not able to go to see her until the morning of the 13th. On your arrival at her residence on that day how did you find her? I found her suffering, sir, simply from nervous excitement and slight bronchitis; she was in bed; I could see nothing in the case likely to cause death, and I didn't anticipate any danger. Did you prescribe for her? I did, and gave the medicine to her husband the same morning; I had no anxiety whatever about the case; I did not see the deceased alive afterwards; on this day I saw her dead body at Ballyvadlea, and assisted Dr. Heffernan in making a *post mortem* examination, the result of which will be found in our joint information."

"The following joint information was next made by Dr. Heffernan and Dr. Crean:—We have made a *post mortem* examination on the body of Bridget Cleary; we found the right hip and thigh and lower portion of the abdomen charred and burned, with the internal organs protruding through the burned apertures; the right hand was also burned, the fingers charred and contracted; we also found the same condition on the left side of the deceased's body, but not so severe; the left hand was also burned, and the fingers charred; the muscles of the lower end of the spine were charred and burned, and the bones exposed; there was a gold earring in the left ear; what remained of the body seemed to be well nourished; there was an abrasion on the inner side of the lips at the right side of the mouth, and the tongue at that side was slightly lacerated; on opening the neck we found the tissues slightly discoloured.

Coroner—Would that be caused by choking?

Dr. Heffernan—Yes, or holding.

Examination resumed—But there were no great marks of violence; on removing the scalp we found extravasated blood on the top of the skull; on removing the skull, we found the vessels of the brain congested, but no injury to the brain substance; the lungs were slightly congested, and the left lung adherent to the chest wall; the spleen was ruptured; we removed the stomach, and found it healthy in appearance.

Coroner—What was your opinion as to the cause of death?

Reply—We believe that shock caused by burns was the cause of death; the rupture of the spleen might have been caused after death; no living person could exist from the severe burns; the whole abdomen was burned, and the contents exposed; the internal organs were sufficiently healthy to carry on life; we are satisfied that the burns were the cause of death; she must have died very soon after the burns.

Dr. Crean—Or probably while they were being inflicted.

The Jury returned the following verdict—"We find that the deceased, Bridget Cleary, late of Ballyvadlea, was found dead on the lands of Tullacussane on Friday, 22nd March, '95, and we further find that death was caused by extensive burns, how, or by whom caused we have no evidence to show. We further find that the deceased was alive in her own house on the 13th March, 1895."

The proceedings then terminated.

## Trial at the Summer Assizes

https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0001648/18950706/126/0006
Cork Constitution - Saturday 06 July 1895

THE TIPPERARY FAIRY CASE

TRIAL OF MICHAEL CLEARY

THE VERDICT. (FROM OUR REPORTER.) Clonmel, Friday.

Mr Justice O'Brien continued the criminal business of the assizes in the Crown Court here this morning, when the hearing of the charge against the man Michael Cleary of having murdered his wife Bridget, at Ballyvadlea, near Fethard, on the 15th March last, was resumed. Considerable interest was again manifested in the proceedings. The prisoners were escorted to the court under a heavy police guard.

Messrs W Ryan, Q C; S Curtis,Q C, and C Molluy, Q C (instructed by Mr Michael Gleeson, Crown solicitor), appeared for the Crown, and

Dr Falkner (instructed by Mr K J Crean, solicitor, Clonmel), defended the prisoner.

At the sitting of the court the examination of Johannah Buurke was resumed.

In reply to his Lordship, the witness said that after the woman was put upon the fire paraffin oil was thrown upon her. Michael Cleary said, "You cowardly, dirty set, would you rather have her with the fairies at Kylenagranagh than have me with her?"

His Lordship—Who put the body on the fire?

Witness—Her father, my eldest brother, and Michael Cleary.

How long did it remain on it? About half an hour. There was not much fire there. I was at the room door when this was going on. The prisoner remained in the room all the time, and Pat Boland, her father, went out of the room roaring and clapping his hands, and said something about the latter end of his days, and that they made a fairy of his daughter. Michael Cleary remarked to William Simpson on Thursday night that it was not one fairy was going out the door, but several. This was after she was brought back from the fire, and put on the bed. After she was put on the fire the prisoner said "I got you the law of God, and come back in the name God." He thought she was dead then, and that the fairy would go up the chimney, and his wife would come back. When the body was taken from the fire on Friday night and placed on the sheet witness's mother said "In the name God let ye go down on your knees and say the Rosary. It was the devil whispered it into his ears." Mike Cleary, the prisoner, put the body the sheet. It was in the room the Rosary was said.

To Dr Falkiner—It was witness's youngest brother, William Kennedy, that headed the Rosary. The prisoner took a cross from his wife on Thursday and said she had no business with it. Witness then took the cross and kept it. On Wednesday the prisoner went for Dr Green to see his wife. John Dunne came in after the prisoner left. When the prisoner returned his wife asked him did he see the doctor, and he said "the doctor gave me no medicine for you. He told me to give you a dose of castor oil. Mike," says she, "I told the doctor I took a dose of castor oil last night, and I nearly died." The prisoner then said to John Dunne, who was standing near the room door, "I have something here that will make her all right."

At this stage his lordship asked had Ganey (the herb doctor) who was discharged by the magistrates being subpoened as witness, and Mr Ryan, QC, replied that he understood he had not been subpoened.

Cross-examination continued by Dr Falkiner —Dunne said to Cleary, "It is not in Fethard you had a right to be, but three days ago you had a right to be beyond with W Ganey; for it is not your wife that's there at all; you will have enough to to bring her back; this is the eighth day, and you had a right to go to Ganey on the fifth day."

Dr Falkiner—Did he mention the name of the herb; did say it was the Lismore? No, he said it was the seventh brother of the seventh sister, that it was the last herb that should be given to her, and that it would kill or cure. He had herbs in his hand, and said to Cleary, "Hail them and make the sign of the cross over them, and go round the house making pishogues and cutting the sign of the cross over the saucepan." The prisoner then went round the house, and he asked Dunne was he doing it right, and Dunne said, "All right, go on." He went to the door two or three times. Witness saw Dunne whispering to Cleary, so that she (witness) should not hear what the charm was. Cleary first sent for the doctor on Monday Morning, and he went himself Tuesday and Wednesday.

Dr Falkiner—At all events you have no doubt that Cleary fully believed that his wife was a witch? No.

Had she got a "blast" on Wednesday.

His Lordship—When you ask had she got a "blast" you must specify what it is, because I have heard of "blasts" of various kinds-there are "blasts" and "blasts"—I have heard of a great many maladies described as "blasts."

Dr Falkiner—Did she get a cold or somethung of that kind? She said she took like a tremble and cold coming up from Kilnagrova.

His Lordship—Does Dunne live there? Yes.

Dr Falkiner—Down in the place where the fort is? Yes.

Is that the place the fairies are supposed to be?

His Lordship—With great respect I cannot allow that question. It has been frequently referred to as Kilnagrova fort.

Dr Falkiner— A connection between the fairies and Kilnagrova was mentioned in the direct evidence.

His Lordship sternly disallowed the question, saying that the fairies may be there in that court. They were not in a play, but on legal evidence, enquiring into a matter of fact.

Dr Falkiner—But you are enquiring into a question of tragedy.

Further cross-examined—Witness said that Bridget Cleary stated that after she came home she lay on the fire and it would not warm her. She said she took to the bed the day after; that on Saturday Mr Griffin sent a man and horse to plough her father's garden; that she got there and got a fresh cold.

Dr Falkiner—Did you ever hear that Boland had been with the fairies?

His Lordship disallowed the question and said that it exceeded extravagance.

Dr Faikiner (to witness)—Did you swear this before—"She (Bridget Cleary) said if I gave shilling to her I used no pishogues. I gave more shillings to her than you know anything about?" Yes.

Did you say this as coming from Bridget Cleary to the prisoner— "Your mother was going with the fairies—that is why you say I am going there now; he said ‘did she tell you she was,' she said, 'she did, that she gave two days in them?'" Yes and two nights.

Dr Falkiner—Now I propose, with your lordship's permission, to ask the witness if Boland's wife was reputed to be a wise woman about witches and fairies.

His Lordship—I cannot allow that question. If you were in a position to show any communication between Boland's wife and Boland himself and this prisoner upon this matter, which, although it might not affect the legal questional all, the crime or quality of the crime might be still admissible to repel malice. I would admit it on that ground. You might now drop Boland's wife and the fairies in ihat connection.

Witness, replying to further questions of Dr Falkiner, said that on Wednesday the prisoner said he got herbs from an old woman in Fethard. Bridget Cleary was raving in those days.

His Lordship wondered why some inquiry was not made as to the nature of the herbs, because if they were foxglove or fairy fingers that were given her, they were a dangerous poison that excited brain disturbance.

Witness went on say that on Wednesday Bridget Cleary said she would take the herbs no more. She used get claret wine and milk with the herbs. She was aware that Father Ryan was sent for on Wednesday morning. She did not see Communion administered to the deceased the day the priest said Mass, but she saw something happen after.

His Lordship—Did you see anything that led you to the conclusion that she did not receive the sacred particle or that it did not remain in her mouth? I cannot aay, but the deceased said, "Father Ryan put something in my mouth to cure me, and it stuck in my mouth." She put her finger in, saying, "Look, Han," taking off something from the roof of her mouth and putting it on the blanket. I afterwards asked Mike Cleary did Father Ryan give Bridget Communion on Friday, and he told me that Father Ryan called him outside the door and asked him was Mass for Bridgie's purpose? He said yes, and Father Ryan give if so he would give her Communion.

Dr Falkiner—Then she did not swallow the Communion?

His Lordship—She has told you what happened. You cannot ask her for an inference.

Katie Burke, a child about twelve years of age, deposed in reply to Mr Ryan she remembered the 14th March. She went to Cleary's house that evening, and saw there Pat Kennedy, James Kennedy, William Kennedy, Minnie Simpon, and her mother. Bridget Cleary was in bed, and Pat Kennedy was lying across the bed. Michael Cleary was giving her something out of a saucepan. Witness heard Michael Cleary ask her "Was she Bridget Cleary, the wife of Michael Cleary, in the name of God?" She said she was. Witness next saw the prisoner John Dunne and her uncle, Pat Kennedy, take her to the fire, and lay her over it. It was a slow fire. She was taken back to bed. Witness then corroborated the evidence as to the deceased being set alight by her husband. After being burned Bridget Cleary's body was laid on a sheet.

At this stage,

Dr Falkiner said he proposed, with his lordship's permission, having heard the evidence of Johannah Burke and her daughter, to take a course that he hoped would recommend itself to his lordship's sense of propriety as being the best for his client's advantage.

His Lordship-There is no course that you can take with my permission. I am not aware, in the practice the law, of any course that could require the authority of the court, nor could the assent of the court in any way affect the course of the proceeding. You have liberty to take any course you think proper yourself.

Dr Falkiner said, having heard the evidence and having read the depositions, and having heard his lordship's address to the Grand Jury and Mr Ryan's address to the jury, he thought it was best for his client that he should take the course of withdrawing the plea of not guilty to murder, and pleading guilty to manslaughter.

His Lordship—You cannot take that course. The matter has often been engaging my attention, in reference especially to a course of the kind once adopted by a judge of great distinction, but I have always come to the conclusion that it was not a strictly legal course, that to an indictment of murder a prisoner could plead guilty to manslaughter. The jury have the power to return the verdict.

Dr Falkiner said, if the Crown would assent to it, he would agree to a verdict of manslaughter being returned by the jury.

His Lordship—It must be the act of the jury not mine.

Mr Ryan, Q C, said, having the conduct of the prosecution and having heard much of that case he was one of those who was not afraid to take any responsibility upon himself, and under all the circumstances of that case he was willing to consent to the course proposed by his friend, Dr Falkiner. He did not intend to refer to any matters beyond this, that the case was one of great peculiarity. There were some extraordinary circumstances attending it, and as he had said before acting on his own resoonsibility he was willing to take that course, and would now ask the jury to find a verdict of manslaughter.

His Lordship—It must require the final assent of the judge to the course being taken. I see no reason to dissent from it.

The issue paper was then handed up to the jury, who at once found a verdict of guilty of manslaughter.

The prisoner was put back.

THE CASE AGAINST THE OTHER PRISONERS.

Patrick Boland, John Dunne, Patrick Kennedy, James Kennedy, Michael Kennedy, William Kennedy, William Ahern, and Mary Kennedy were then arraigned for having on the 14th March unlawfully and maliciously wounded Bridget Cleary, and on a second count with having committed actual bodily harm. They all pleaded not guilty, the prisoner Dunne remarking—"I was not there on Friday night at all; I was in it on Thursday, that's all."

Mr De Renzy (instructed by Dr Hanrahan, solicitor), appeared for the prisoner Ahern, and the other prisoners were undefended.

A jury having been sworn,

Mr Ryan, Q C, stated the case for the Crown. The jury had nothing to do in this case with the proceedings of the 15th March, and their investigation would be principally directed to the proceedings of the 14th March, when the prisoners were in the house of Michael Cleary, and acting in concert with him, inliicting on a young, virtuous, and prepossessing woman injuries which, if they did not lead directly to her death, certainly put her for the remainder of her miserable life in great suffering and pain.

Counsel then briefly referred to the acts implicating the prisoners, after which evidence was called, and

Johanna Burke repeated the evidence already given, mentioning in detail the several acts of the prisoners on Thursday, the 14th, in Cleary's house.

William Simpson gave corroborative evidence.

Pat Boland, on being asked had he any questions to put to the witness, denied that he put his daughter on the fire, but he tried to keep her from the fire. She was his only daughter and was able to make good money at dressmaking.

Mary Simpson, wife of the last witness was also examined. She heard Mrs Cleary say she was being taken from the bed to the fire to give her a chance not to make a herring of her. At the fireplace she was asked by her husband and Patrick Boland "if she were Bridget Cleary, wife of Michael Cleary, and to answer in the name the Father, Son and Holy Ghost." She replied, "Yes, dada, I am." After deceased was brought back from the fire witness saw a bluish mark on her neck, and also a spot on her forehead.

In reply to Boland—Witness said she saw him in the room.

Boland —You did not, because Michael Cleary kept me out the room. There is not a word of truth in that.

District Inspector Wansbrough was next examined. He gave evidence of the situation of Cleary's house and the location of the rooms. The length of the fire-place was four feet, the width of the bars of the grate 13 inches the top being 12 inches off the ground, with a depth of 17 inches from the front bar to the back of the chimney.

This closed the case for the Crown, and Mr Ryan said the Crown wished to enter a *nolle prosequi* in the case Wm Ahern.

His Lordship—I would direct the jury to that effect.

Ahern was then discharged.

His Lordship told the prisoners that if any of them wished they could have Ahern examined as a witness.

Patrick Kennedy then called Ahern and asked him if he saw him inside the bed holding his first cousin or assisting to hold her.

Witness replied -I saw you, but I don't know whether you were holding her or not.

Did you see me bringing her the fire on the 14th March? Yes.

Examined by John Dunne—Did I order that girl to the fire? I didn't hear you.

Upon your oath who ordered her to the fire? I heard Michael Cleary order her to the fire.

His Lordship—Did you hear anybody else order her? Dunne said something about the fire.

Prisoner James Kennedy—Do you remember seeing me bring Bridget Cleary, my cousin, to the fire on the 14th March? No: I took no notice. I was talking to William Simpson.

Did you see me in the kitchen at all while they had her on the fire? I could not say.

Prisoner William Kennedy—Did you see me assist in bringing her to the fire? I could not say.

To Michael Kennedy—Witness said he could not say if Michael Kennedy was there.

To Mr Ryan—He heard Michael Cleary say, take her to the fire, and John Dunne said something about the fire.

This closed the case for the Crown.

The prisoner Dunne said he never spoke of bringing the woman to the fire. It was done against his will. The day after he charged Michael Cleary with putting her on the fire.

Patrick Kennedy said he never lifted his hand on the woman.

Prisoner Dunne addressed the jury, denying complicity in the crime, and stated that he believed it was a concocted job between the parties.

His Lordship then proceeded to charge the jury, in the course of which he said none of the prisoners were charged with murder, although there was an indictment found by the Grand Jury which involved them at least in the liability to answer at law for the crime of murder, namely, all who were present on the 15th March. They need not be told that was a very extraordinary case that demonstrated a degree of darkness in the mind, not of one person, but of several, of moral darkness, and even of religious darkness, which had come with great feeling of surprise upon many persons. He had watched the case with great vigilance and care to find motive for the death this woman, and although he was not entirely satisfied with the evidence given as to previous relations of Cleary with his wife, and was not altogether satisfied with the nature and degree of evidence as to mediums employed for the purpose of reclaiming his wife from the evil, preternatural companionship she was supposed to have entered into, yet Cleary apoeared to have conceived the idea, that his wife was in some degree under wicked supernatural influences. There was not sufficient evidence to lead him to the conclusion that Cleary used it as a pretext for taking his wife's life, but he should take it that he supposed she was not his wife, but some other kind of being; that his wife had been spirited away. His own case was that he adopted this means of superstition, of sorcery, incantation or charm, to expel this evil influence from his wife and to restore her identity, and while he had a competent medical man in attendance upon his wife, who had contracted a severe cold, he for some extraordinary reason resorted to the advise of a person skilled in herbs as a means of disenchantment, and administered these drugs of a deadly and dangerous kind. One of the most extraordinary points in connection with this case was that Michael Cleary, who was engaged in certain means for the recovery of his wife was that he appeared to have been so entirely devoid of the ordinary feeling that was found especially to prevail in persons in his rank life that he took no interest whatever in his father's death. The old man, Boland, who should have been the first to resent any wrong to his daughter, made no remonstrance whatever against any kind violence—no voice raised to assist her—no hand raised to help her. His lordship could perfectly understand that this thing may have been intended for her benefit, but it appeared to him the most extraordinary circumstance that could be imagined that when she was taken down from the room to the kitchen, that even in pity for the terror of her mind when she was sufficiently conscious whatever her state of raving was-to know that she was to be taken away to be roasted or burned. That brought no remonstrance from the persons who were there in the form of men, whatever the effect of this gross and shameful and monstrous darkness of the human mind. All the people in the room at the time appeared to have been engaged in this extraordinary ordeal, which was practised centuries ago, not, he took it, for the object of taking away her life, but of disenchanting her in some way. During the dreadful ordeal, she appeared to have answered the question put to her by her father and husband as to her identity, a question put to her with the solemnity of the invocation of the Holy Name of God. He would now take the case of Patrick Boland. At this stage of his lordship's address the prisoner Boland interrupred, stating that he did not take her to the fire; he was so weak. His lordship, continuing, said he did not think that statement was inconsistent with the evidence, because it appeared to him extraordinary and unnatural conduct on the part of Boland towards his own daughter, inflicted on her from any delusion or any cause whatsoever, and it occurred to his lordship that the act he was alleged by Johannah Burke to have committed was possibly consistent with his not taking any active part in putting her over the fire. His lordship pointed out that the case of John Dunne, Patrick Kennedy, Wm Kennedy and James Kennedy, were distinct from the cases of the others, inasmuch as they were more actively engaged and if the jury came to the conclusion that they were the persons who took the woman to the fire, his lordship saw nothing that could lead the jury to come to a conclusion in their favour. In conclusion, his lordship said, it was awful to contemplate that this unhappy woman was taken away with all her imperfections on her head. He could not see there was any kind of law or legal excuse for the action of those persons in putting that woman on the fire, and for the other persons who were aiding and assisting in it. At all events as regards the four persons specially engaged, his Lordship could not conceive any doctrine so dangerous to morality, and the public peace as that idea of expelling a witch from a body should be an excuse for taking life and it was not in point of law.

His lordship's charge occupied an hour.

The jury after a deliberation of forty minutes found all the prisoners guilty of wounding, but strongly recommended Patrick Boland, Michael Kennedy and Mary Kennedy to mercy.

His Lordship in sentencing the prisoners said. He took it that Patrick Kennedy was the most guilty, taking all the circumstances into consideration, not merely for the wounding of this young woman, but also for what had appeared concerning his part in the secret removal of her body. He sentenced him to be kept in penal servitude for five years. John Dunne was equally guilty with Patrick Kennedy and deserved the same punishment. He was not, however, a party to the transaction in connection with the burying of the woman's body on that Friday, though he took a very prominent part in what happened on Thursday. He was an old man, and partly because the sentence his lordship would pass upon him may consume a great part of the remainder of the life that nature had allotted to him he would not pass the same sentence on him as Patrick Kennedy, but he would sentence him to be kept in penal servitude for three years. William Kennedy and James Kennedy also had taken a principal part in the matter, and he had deliberated principally as to the sentence he would impose on them because one of their brothers had been sentenced to a term of penal servitude. He passed a sentence of a year and a half's imprisonment on each of them from the date of their committal. A misfortune had fallen upon Patrick Boland as great any sentence that could be passed upon him, the loss of his daughter's life, and whatever regret he might express for it his daughter was dead largely by his own act, and his lordship should consider that matter in reference to his sentence, and he should pass a heavier sentence upon him than he otherwise would, to mark his sense his great misconduct in allowing his daughter's life to be taken without any remonstrance, and for having taken part in the proceedings. He would sentence him, old as he was, to six months' imprisonment. Michael Kennedy was, perhaps, the most innocent of all the parties, and he would sentence him to only six months' imprisonment with hard labour. He would pass no sentence upon the old woman, Mary Kennedy. Nature had decreed sentence upon her not far distant and he would not abridge the remainder of her life by sending her to jail. He therefore ordered her discharge and he was not at all uninfluenced in the course by the reparation that her daughter had made for her error by the evidence she had given.

Michael Cleary was then put forward for sentence.

Dr Falkiner, in mitigation of punishment, mentioned that prisoner willingly agreed the propriety of pleading guilty to manslaughter. His mind, as his lordship had said, was sunk in gross darkness, and the remorse he would suffer for the remainder of his life would punish him infinitely more than the sentence which his lordship would be bound to pass upon him.

His lordship, in passing sentence, said the prisoner had by the acquiescence of his own counsel submitted a verdict finding him guilty of being the cause of his wife's death, and the advice he received, as well as the observations that had been made on his behalf, were distinguished by great judgment and consideration, because his life was in great peril for the life he had taken away, and if, as was not at all unlikely, the jury would have found a verdict of guilty upon the capital charge, he stood in most imminent danger of answering to the law for a most cruel and a most wicked crime as to which perhaps it would be difficult to satisfy the Executive that were entrusted with the supreme decision. In cases of that kind the difficulty of satisfying, if all the evidence had been produced, that it would not reveal its true history, whether there was not some reason or motive behind that, clothed itself with the pretext of superstitious practices in order to make away with the life of his own wife. He was not satisfied at all that the enquiry that had taken place, conducted with great skill and ability, had resulted with the whole truth being known connected with this matter, and it would not be easy to convince him that persons of mature years, and those who were possessed of more than the usual intelligence, for in the age in which they lived, so entirely yielded to the influence of delusions concerning the preternatural power that would have led the prisoner with the assistance of so many persons whom he called to his aid, to take the course he took. He judged the matter independent of that altogether, and of any conjecture or suspicions that might exist in his mind upon the subject. He decided the matter wholly and entirely upon the evidence given before him. The short of the matter was that he burned his wife alive, and he did not know that those medicines the prisoner procured, or those herbs were really intended for the cure. He formed no opinion upon that question all. Although the evidence had not been such as to remove from his mind some idea that a further inquiry might have conduced to a more satisfactory explanation of couduct otherwise apparently incapable of being accounted for, his lordship rested on the fact that the prisoner inflicted upon the woman—whom he swore before the altar to cherish and protect—that he took her life away by a form of cruelty which the fortitude of the martyr alone had been found able to resist, and which was generally regarded as the most cruel and painful of human afflictions by burning her alive. She was not dead at the time he threw the paraffin oil on her, and his wicked hand sent her to another world in the very prime of her life, a young woman who confided to him her affections and her life, and he most wantonly and most cruelly and most wretchedly betrayed her. His lordship could not doubt at all that most of the afflictions that overtake great crime may be his lot during the remainder of his life, and may result in great remorse of conscience for what he had done, but his lordship was bound to satisfy the law and to satisfy public justice by punishment adequate to his offence, and his lordship had been deliberating in his mind upon a doubt concerning whether it would be his duty to stop short of the extreme sentence, but he would show the opinion he entertained concerning the prisoner's guilt, and that was that he be kept in penal servitude for twenty years. (Sensation in court.)

During the delivery of lordship's sentence the prisoner wept bitterly. He seemed much agitated, and left the dock wringing his hands.

The prisoners were subsequently removed under a heavy escort to the County Jail, and attracted considerable attention.
