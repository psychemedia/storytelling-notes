"GONE WITH THE FAIRIES"

A good deal of excitement has been caused in the district about Drangan and Cloneen by the "mysterious disappearance" of a labourer's wife, who lived with her husband, a farm labourer, in that part of the country. The poor woman had been ill for some time, and a few days ago she told her husband that if he did not do something for her by a certain time "she would have to be going." An old woman who had been nursing the sick woman was sitting up with her as usual one night last week, and, as she puts it, the invalid was "drawn" away. Search has been made everywhere, and the police have been communicated with, but up to this afternoon no trace of the missing woman has been discovered. The country-people entertain the opinion that she has "gone with the fairies!"

The Mysterious Disappearance of a Woman

Nine Persons Arrested and Remanded.

A telegram received in Clonmel last evening announces that the body of the missing woman, Mrs Cleary, has been found in Drangan police sub-district.

On Wednesday evening the authorities made the first public move in connection with this case, when nine men and one woman were arrested and brought before Colonel Evanson, R M, and Mr W Tennant, D L, in Fethard, where after a number of informations were sworn they were sent on to Clonmel. Here they were brought before Mr T C Grubb, J P, and the informations having been read, they were remanded for eight days. The defendants are Michl Cleary, Patk Boland, John Dunne, Patk Kennedy, James Kennedy, Michl Kennedy, Wm Kennedy, Wm Ahern, Mary Kennedy. and Denis Ganey.

Informations were sworn by Wm Simmons, caretaker of an evicted farm at Cloneen; Johanna Burke, Rathkenny; and D J Wansbury. It appeared from the sworn evidence that the woman was treated under the instructions of the man Ganey, who is known as an herb or fairy doctor, and that the other defendants had held her over the fire and forced her to swallaw a noxious fluid. It appeared from the sworn evidence that they forcibly held her on the bed and compelled her to drink the stuff alluded to above, and it is said that in consequence of this she left the house. The first nine-named defendants are charged with having unlawfully beaten and ill-treated Bridget Cleary and caused her great bodily harm. The man Ganey is charged with procuring such an offence to be committed.

He states om oath—I am in employment of Thomas Lindsay, and on the night of the 14th instant, accompanied by my wife, between nine and ten o'clock, I went to the house of Patrick Boland where the Clearys also resided.

THE "WITCH" OF CLONMEL.

FUNERAL OF THE VICTIM.

The funeral of Bridget Cleary, who, as alleged, was burned to death by her husband near Clonmel, county Tipperary, in the superstitious belief that she had been carried off by the fairies and evil spirit put into possession of her body, took place at Cloveen on Thursday afternoon, and was boycotted by all her relations and neighbours. Not one civilian attended the burial, and the rites of sepulture were performed by four police-constables. There was no hearse, and the coffin was borne by common car from Fethard. The significance this will be understood when it is remembered that the Irish peasantry regard a funeral not only as an expression of respect for the deceased and sympathy with the family, but as invested with a certain degree of sanctity. The fact is, however, that the people believe—or, perhaps, with a view to the defence of the prisonars, affect to believe—that the real Bridget Cleary will come back, riding on a white horse sent by the fairies, and that if they can succeed in cutting the reins of the horse they will secure her. With this object, there are, it is stated, on the watch on the mountains, one of whom is specially provided with sharp knife to cut the reins. The magisterial inquiry into the occurrence is still proceeding. In addition to the evidence previously given, a daughter of the principal witness, an intelligent child named Kate Burke, described as an eyewitness of the scene, was examined, and corroborated in every detail the statements of her mother. The prisoners declined to ask the witness any questions, but most them said that she was quite right in what she had stated. The accused persons were again remanded.

Portsmouth Evening News - Monday 08 April 1895

"WITCH-BURNING" CASE. COMMITTAL OF THE PRISONERS. At the resumed hearing on Saturday of the charges against the prisoners accused of burning Bridget Cleary Clonmel, the evidence of the deceased woman's father incriminating the husband was read over. Cleary meanwhile became terribly excited, denying that the fathers evidence was true. He called the other prisonere a "rotten crowd," and said that if he did not get justice there he would get it in heaven.

The prisoners, Mary Kennedy, John Dunne, and Pat Kennedy made statements supporting what had been said by the father. They declared that Cleary went out and dug a hole as a grave. Pat Kennedy at first refused to help, but on being threatened with a knife consented. They rolled the body in a sheet and bag and put it in hole, Cleary forcing down the body with his foot. Next day he said to John Dunne it was not his wife, but a witch he had burned.

During the making of the several statements the other prisoners stood apart from Cleary in the dock.

All the prisoners were committed for trial the capital charge.

"R.A.," writing the *Spectator*, referring to the above case, maintains that Mrs. Cleary did not meet with her end owing to the belief witchcraft or demoniacal expression, which has real hold in Ireland. "She perished," "R, A." says, "owing to the belief in the fairies.

"In Munster, when a child appears delicate, or a young woman consumptive or hysterical, the conclusion often is that the child or the woman has bean carried off by the fairies, to be made playmate or nurse to the young fairies, and that a fairy substitute resembling the person taken away is deposited in their place, which gradually declines, and ultimately dies. The belief is that if the changeling be tortured by fire its fairy parents will hear its cries, rush to its aid, carry it to fairyland, and at the same moment restore the real person, who will be found sleeping calmly the bed.

"Cleary and 'the neighbours' evidently believed that the being they tortured was not Cleary's wife, but a changeling. He addressed her, 'In the name of God, are you Bridget Boland?' (her maiden name), believing that thus adjured the being would confess it was fairy. Again, after the burning, many of the men of the locality sa£ up all night in a 'fort' (earth embankment of ancient Irish village), armed with black-handled knives. These poor people thought that fairy procession would pass by, that in the midst would be Mrs. Cleary riding on a grey horse, and that if anyone rushed forward and cut her bonds with a black-handled knife (a potent weapon against all evil spirits), she would at once be restored to the world. In the 'Tales of Terror and Wonder' it was thus that Fair Janet rescued Tam Lin from the fairies. She sat at Giles Cross on Halloween, at the 'murk and midnight hour', when she sees the fairy host go by:

First she let the black pass by,  
And next she let the brown,  
But quickly ran to the milk-white steed.  
And drew its rider down.

Thus Fair Janet rescued Lin; thus the poor dwellers on the slope of Saere-na-mon (the 'Witches Hill,' a haunted mountain) believed that they would rescue Bridget.

EXTRAORDINARY AND DREADFUL OCCURRENCE IN CO. TIPPERARY.

MYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCE OF A WOMAN.

In our last issue we referred briefly to the mysterious disappearance of a woman named Bridget Cleary, wife of a man named Michael Cleary, residing at Ballyvadlea — a remote, lonely, and isolated district lying a short distance from Cloneen, between that village and Mullinahone. The wildest rumours were in circulation about the matter since her disappearance first became known; and as day after day passed without any intelligence of her whereabouts, the excitement became the more intense and widespread, until at length the entire affair became the one prevailing topic of conversation. It appears that the woman was believed by some parties to have been possessed by an evil spirit, the consequence of which was that she was subjected to the treatment that resulted in her disappearance. Meanwhile the police, under the direction of District-Inspector J. A. Wansbrough, of Carrick-on-Suir—the officer of the district in which the deceased and her husband resided with her father, Patrick Boland—proceeded to investigate the circumstances connected with the affair, with the result that informations were sworn before Mr. W. W. Tennant, J.P., of Ballinderry Castle, by William Simpson, caretaker, living at Cloneen, and a woman named Burke; and on Wednesday an information was made by Mr. Wansbrough, before Colonel Evanson, R.M., and Mr. Tennant, when warrants were issued for the arrest of ten persons—nine of whom were charged with having been implicated, severally and jointly, in the ill-treatments of the woman; and the remaining prisoner with having caused the offence to be committed.

MAGISTERIAL INQUIRY AT THE TOWN HALL, CLONMEL.

On Thursday last the prisoners were brought up at the Town Hall, and charged with the offence disclosed in the informations upon which their arrest was made. The presiding magistrate was Thomas Cambridge Grubb, Esq. There were also present—County-Inspector F. B. Wilson, District-Inspector J. A. Wansbrough, Carrick-on-Suir, who has charge of the case; District-Inspector H. Jones, to watch proceedings on behalf of the Crown. The prosecution was at the suit of Mr. Wansbrough, and the names of the prisoners are—Michael Cleary (husband of the missing woman); Patrick Boland (her father); John Dunne, Patrick James, Michael, and Mary Kennedy, and William Ahearne, who were charged with having, at Ballyvadlea, on the 14th March, jointly and severally unlawfully assaulted and ill-treated Bridget Cleary, causing her actual bodily harm. Denis Ganey, another of the prisoners, was charged with having caused the offence to be committed. The accused were not professionally represented at the inquiry; and the proceedings merely consisted of the reading of the informations in their presence, which had been previously taken, and were now converted into depositions.
Mr. Wansbrough was sworn, and deposed as follows—I refer to the informations of William Simpson and Johanna Burke, sworn respectively on the 18th and 19th March before Mr. Tennant, J.P., in which the defendants and each of them stand charged as stated. I have just and reasonable grounds for believing that I shall be able to produce evidence against the defendants implicating each of them in committing the above offence charged, and I pray they may each be remanded for further examination.
The informations referred to by Mr. Wansbrough were next read—that made by William Simpson was as follows:—

William Simpson, Ballyvadlea, sworn, said—I am in the employment of Thomas Lindsay; on the night of the 14th inst., accompanied by my wife, between 9 and 10 o'clock, I went to the house of Patrick Boland, occupied by him and by Michael and Bridget Cleary (his wife) at Ballyvadlea; I saw Bridget Cleary, who was ill; when we arrived close to the house we met Mrs. Johanna Burke, and inquired from her how was Mrs. Cleary; she said they were given her at this time herbs which they got from Ganey, over the mountain, and that no person would be let in for some time; we then proceeded to the window of the house, which is a new labourer's cottage; in one of the front rooms I heard voices shouting, "Take it, you b——, you old faggot, or we will kill you;" the shutters of the windows were closed, and the door locked; after a short time the door was opened, and I and my wife and Johanna Burke went into the house; I noticed the room I had heard the shouts from; I saw there John Dunne, Patrick Kennedy, James Kennedy, and William Kennedy holding Bridget Cleary on the bed; she was on her back, and had a night dress on her; her husband, Michael Cleary, was standing by the bedside; I heard him call for (mentioning a noxious fluid), and he said, "throw it on"; it was brought by Mary Kennedy; Michael Cleary had a saucepan in his hand at the time; it would appear as if they threw the liquid on the woman; it was thrown on her by some of those present; Wm. Ahearn was present holding a candle; P. Boland, M. Kennedy, and Johanna Burke were in the room, and also Kate Burke, a child; I saw Bridget Cleary struggling on the bed; I heard her speaking; she said "leave me alone;" I then saw her husband give her some liquid off a spoon; I heard some of the parties present say it was herbs; she was held down at the time by force; one of those present kept a hand on her mouth, and others held her down for ten minutes after she got the herbs; a man at each side of the bed kept the body swinging about the whole time; she screamed horrible; they cried out, "Come home, come home, Bridget Boland;" from what I could learn they all thought Mrs. Cleary was a witch, and endeavoured to hunt her out of the house by torturing her body; some time after I saw them take her out of her bed, carry her to the kitchen fire, and hold her over it; in a short time I could see her body rest on the bars of the grate where the fire was burning; those who placed her over the fire were John Dunne, and Patrick, William, and James Kennedy; I saw some red marks on her forehead; one of those present said they had to use a red poker on her to make her take the medicine; I saw some marks on her neck; her husband put some questions to her at the fire; he asked her if she was his wife; after she answered the questions they put her again into the bed; I remained in the house until 6 o'clock in the morning, when I went home; I saw her again about midday on the 15th inst., in bed in her house; she was not quite the same at the time; I have known her for the past four years, and never knew anything to be the matter with her; I saw her frequently; she lives about 200 yards from me; I was disgusted at the operation; the door was locked, and I could not leave the house; on the night of the 15th Bridget Cleary left her home; she has not since been found.
The information of Johanna Burke was next read, in which she made the following statement:—On the night of the 14th inst., I went to the house where Bridget Cleary resides, to see her, as she was unwell; when I went to the door it was locked; I was outside the window, and heard a voice from the house saying, "You witch or you [illegible]." I don't know which word was used. Wm. Simpson and his wife were with me at the time; after some time the door was opened and I went into the house; I saw Patrick Kennedy, Wm. Kennedy, James Kennedy, and John Dunne; they were holding Bridget Cleary by the hands and feet on the bed; she was on her back; her husband Michael Cleary, was beside the bed; he had a saucepan in his hand; I saw him try to give her something from off a spoon, which he took from the saucepan, and they forced her to take it; some person present called for a liquid; my mother, Mary Kennedy, brought it; I think it was her husband (Cleary) sprinkled and threw it on her; her husband and the four men raised her in the bed; her appearance was changed; they took her to the fire place and held her over the fire, and said if she did not answer her name three times they would burn her; the fire was low at the time; a few sticks were placed across it; she repeated her name after her father, and husband; they stopped at her until she answered her name three times; they then removed her to the bed; some of the women put on a clean chemise on her, which I aired for her; the old one they took off her was of striped flannel; I saw a slight mark on her forehead, near the hair; also a mark on her neck; I left the house next morning about daybreak; I was at the house on the night of the 15th inst.; Bridget Cleary was raving; after some time she got up, dressed, and sat at the fire; she afterwards went to bed; I went out for some sticks; when I returned I met her at the doorway going out against me with her night dress; I endeavoured to hold her and failed; since that time I have not seen her; her husband followed her for some time, and returned; he did not see her; she is missing ever since, and they made search for her.

In the case against Denis Ganey, Mr. Wansbrough, D.I., when applying for a warrant for his arrest, made an information before Col. Evanson, R.M., and Mr. Tennant, at Fethard, on the 20th instant, which was now read. In it he stated—"I have just and reasonable grounds for believing the ill-treatment which Bridget Cleary was subjected to, was in administering to her herbs prepared for her by Denis Ganey, of Kylesaltea, and that it was by his instructions she was placed over a fire, and wounded and otherwise ill-treated. I charge Denis Ganey with causing Bridget Cleary to be ill-treated, and great actual bodily harm done to her."

Mr. Casey, C.P.S. (to the prisoner, Michael Cleary, husband of Bridget Cleary)—You have heard the deposition and informations which have been read, do you wish to ask Mr. Wansbrough any questions?

Cleary at first remained silent, and the presiding magistrate, Mr. Grubb, repeated the question.

Cleary—All I have to say is that I would not ill-treat my wife.

Mr. Casey—That is not a question, but a statement. Have you any question to put to the District-Inspector? Cleary replied that he had not, and further understood to say that it was he who had gone for the man, Denis Ganey.

Patrick Boland (father of Bridget Cleary) was next asked a similar question, and he said—I don't know; I have nothing to say about my daughter.

John Dunne, upon being questioned, said—The statement I have to make is—

Mr. Casey—If you wish to put any question to...

the officer do so. This is not the time to make any statement.

Dunne and also two others of the accused (Patrick Kennedy and James Kennedy) declined to put any questions.

The next prisoner, Michael Kennedy, when the usual inquiry was put to him, said—I wish to know why I should be here at all. I was only ten minutes in the house. I did not wish to do her any harm.

Mr. Wansbrough, D.I.—You are charged with being present in the house, and your question simply proves that you were there.

Michael Kennedy—I did not remain there.

Three others of the defendants—William Kennedy, William Ahearne, and Mary Kennedy (a rather middle-aged woman) declined to ask any questions.

The last of the accused, Denis Ganey, when questioned, asked—Did he see me? Does he say that I assisted in doing away with the woman?

The following passage was read for the accused from one of the informations sworn by Mr. Wansbrough—"I believe that the ill-treatment which Bridget Cleary was subjected to was administering herbs prepared for her by Denis Ganey, and that it was by his instructions she was ill-treated."

Ganey—Did he hear me? Does he swear that I instructed the people to do so? What grounds has he for charging me?

Mr. Wansbrough, D.I.—The two informations which have been sworn, and one of the accused actually states that he went for you.

Ganey—What grounds has he for believing that I gave instructions? When did he see or hear of my being there, or was I there at all?

Mr. Wansbrough—I refer to the information of William Simpson, one of the persons present upon the occasion with which we are dealing, in which he uses the following words—"We met Mrs. Johanna Burke, and we asked her how Mrs. Bridget Cleary, and she said they were giving her a bath that they got from Ganey over the mountains." I also refer to the admission by Michael Cleary a moment ago in the presence of the court, "It was I went for Ganey."

Michael Cleary—I went to him.

Mr. Wansbrough (addressing the court)—Your worship, the unfortunate woman, Bridget Cleary, is still unable to be found, though every search has been made for her by the police. The people in the neighbourhood have been interrogated, and other means have been taken to find out something of her.

but as yet to no effect. Under these circumstances I have only to apply to this court to have all the accused remanded to prison, pending her discovery, and ascertaining the condition in which she is.

Mr. Grubb—I don't see why your application should be refused in the absence of the woman, who is yet missing. It would be a great satisfaction if she were discovered. This, I must say, is one of the most melancholy cases that has occurred in this neighbourhood for a very long time.

Patrick Boland—I have three more persons, and they can say that at twelve o'clock on the night she went away she got up and dressed.

Mr. Grubb—Where is she now?

Boland—I don't know. She was there on Friday night.

The prisoner John Dunne made a similar statement, and mentioned the names of a number of persons who could prove she was there late that night.

The application for a remand was then granted.

The prisoner Ganey asked to be admitted to bail, but his application was refused by the court.

All the male prisoners were then removed in custody to Clonmel, and the woman to Limerick Female Prison.

DISCOVERY OF THE BODY OF THE MISSING WOMAN.

On yesterday the search for the missing woman, Bridget Cleary, was continued with unabated energy. County Inspector Wilson attended at Cloneen, and District-Inspector Wansbrough, Sergeant Rogers, Mullinahone; Acting-Sergeant Dowling, Clonmel, and a large number of the constabulary continued their re-searches, with the result, as telegraphed to Clonmel last evening, that the remains of the unfortunate woman were discovered buried in a field beside a ditch in the Drangan sub-district, some distance from the village of Cloneen. The police authorities here at once had intelligence of the discovery conveyed to the coroner for the district, James J. Shee, Esq., J.P., who proceeded to-day to the locality for the purpose of holding an inquest. Colonel Evanson, R.M., and the County Inspector also left Clonmel to be present officially during the inquiry.

THE FINDING OF THE BODY—THE INQUEST—TO-DAY.

After the investigation at Clonmel, District-Inspector Wansbrough directed the police at Cloneen, Drangan, and Mullinahone to make diligent search for the missing woman. Parties from the three stations at once proceeded to execute those orders, and about three o'clock on yesterday afternoon Sergeant Rodgers, of Mullinahone, when walking through a swampy bit of land, about a quarter of a mile from Cleary's house, had his attention attracted by broken bushes and freshly-dug earth close to the fence in an angle of the field. Constables Somers, O'Connor and O'Callaghan, who had been searching in the vicinity came to the spot, and in a few minutes the shallow covering of clay was removed, and the body of the unfortunate woman, Bridget Cleary, revealed. It presented a most terrible appearance. There was no clothing, with the exception of a pair of black stockings. The back and lower part of the remains were terribly burned. The head was enveloped in a sack, and an old sheet was rolled round the rest of the body. The hole in which it had been deposited was only about three feet in length. The body was on the back, and partly on the left side, and the limbs were cramped up. The arms were folded across the breast. The matter was at once, as already mentioned, reported to the coroner by the police authorities, and the body remained in charge of a party of police at the place where it was found.

Most extraordinary and almost incredible reports are current in the locality with respect to the occurrence. The whole matter is being investigated by the authorities, and on the resumption of the magisterial inquiry in Clonmel, very sensational evidence will, we understand, be forthcoming.
The inquest was opened to-day by James J. Shee Esq., J.P., Coroner, in a vacant house belonging to Mr. John Anglim, at Ballyvadlea, some short distance from the residence of the Clearys.

The following farmers residing in the district were sworn on the jury:—Thomas Ryan (foreman); John Anglim, Maurice O'Brien, Joseph Maher, Michael Slattery, jun; James Morris, Michael Slattery, sen; Edward O'Brien, Philip Slattery, William Stokes, Francis Bradshaw, Patrick White, Thomas Croko, and Thomas Cahill.
Mr. Heard, Divisional Commissioner, Kilkenny, County Inspector Wilson, Clonmel; Colonel Evanson, R.M., Mr. W. W. Fennant, J.P., District Inspector Wansbrough, Carrick-on-Suir, and District Inspector L. H. S. Hallsy, Kilkenny.

Constable O'Connor, Mullinahone; Acting-Sergeant Dowling, and Constable Somers, Cloneen; Acting-Sergeant Egan and Constable Callaghan, Drangan, were present at the inquest.

Dr. W. E. Heffernan, Killenaule, and Dr. W. Crean, Fethard were in attendance, and at request of the coroner and jury, proceeded to make a post mortem examination while the other evidence was being taken.

The Coroner, addressing the jury, said they had been sworn to inquire how the deceased came by her death. He did not know anything about the case, and had read nothing about it in the newspapers. He knew nothing of the circumstances except what he had heard that morning, and certainly if what he had heard was true it was one of the most frightful things that had occurred in this country for years. Amongst Hottentots one would not expect to hear of such an occurrence. He was happy to tell the jury that he would save them the trouble and anxiety of inquiring into it, because his idea was that they would fulfill the ends of justice so far as their inquiry was concerned by ascertaining the cause of death. There were some eight or nine persons in prison charged with an offence upon the unfortunate woman. He would not like to hold an inquiry behind the backs of persons charged with a crime, and that was another reason why he did not intend to ask them to go into the matter. There was no doubt that the jury had power to call on him to examine witnesses, and if they did so, he was prepared to call them. They would have evidence of identification, and then the evidence of the doctors who were holding a post mortem examination. If the jury wished he would go further, but he thought it would be better not.

Foreman—I think so, too, sir.

Coroner—You will now view the body, which has been brought over here.

The jury then proceeded to an outhouse, where the body lay, and formally viewed it. It was wrapped up in the sheet in which it was when discovered, and presented a most ghastly appearance—the back and lower part of the body was severely burned; the head and face were apparently uninjured. The features were those of a young woman, and were much distorted.

When the jury returned to the house, County Inspector Wilson and Divisional Commissioner Heard arrived from Clonmel.

The Coroner, addressing the latter, said this was a most frightful and sad occurrence which had taken place. He had advised the jury merely to go into the cause of death, taking the evidence of identification and the evidence of the doctors. If Mr. Heard was satisfied he would leave the rest of the investigation to him and to Colonel Evanson.

Mr. Heard—All the jury have to do is to find the cause of death.

Constable Samuel Somers, Cloneen, was the first witness examined by the coroner. He said—I have this day viewed the body of Bridget Cleary, now lying dead at Ballyvadlea in this county; she was married to Michael Cleary, cooper, and they resided in this townland; she was about 26 years of age; I knew her for about three years.

Was she a healthy woman? She was, sir; I saw her last about a month or six weeks ago.

Have you any doubt that the remains you have viewed this day are those of Bridget Cleary? No doubt, sir.

Was it reported to you that she had been missing

"...for some time? It was reported at Cloneen on the 16th inst. that she was missing—that she had gone away from her father's house; we had been searching for her up to yesterday; I was out with another constable on yesterday, and I saw Sergeant Rodgers and Acting-Sergeant Dowling, who were searching too; about 3 o'clock I observed them standing in an angle of a field; we faced for them at once; I saw two constables digging in a dyke, and after a short time they exhumed the body of the deceased, Bridget Cleary; it had the appearance of being some days dead, and there were burned, charred marks on it.

By the Foreman—How did you identify her? By her features.—They were not injured? Her features were perfect.

Coroner—Is there any evidence as to the date of the woman's death?

District-Inspector Wansbrough—I have none at present, sir.

Coroner—I believe all the people who were in the house are in gaol?

District-Inspector Wansbrough—Dr. Crean, who was present when the deceased, may be able to give you some information. I believe he visited her case.

Coroner—Would you, Colonel Evanson, wish to ask any questions?

Colonel Evanson—No; I am merely here in connection with the inquiry which I am conducting myself.

Coroner—We will all be satisfied with your inquiry.

Dr. Heffernan and Dr. Crean having conducted the post mortem, their evidence was next taken.

Dr. Crean was first examined. He stated, in reply to the Coroner—I knew the deceased. Were you called to see her recently? I was on the 13th March, but I was not able to go to see her until the morning of the 13th. On your arrival at her residence on that day how did you find her? I found her suffering, sir, simply from nervous excitement and slight bronchitis; she was in bed; I could see nothing in the case likely to cause death, and I didn't anticipate any danger. Did you prescribe for her? I did, and gave the medicine to her husband the same morning; I had no anxiety whatever about the case; I did not see the deceased alive afterwards; on this day I saw her dead body at Ballyvadlea, and assisted Dr. Heffernan in making a post mortem examination, the result of which will be found in our joint information."

"The following joint information was next made by Dr. Heffernan and Dr. Crean:—We have made a post mortem examination on the body of Bridget Cleary; we found the right hip and thigh and lower portion of the abdomen completely burned, with the internal organs protruding through the burned aperture; the right hand was also burned, the fingers charred and contracted; we also found the same condition on the left side of the deceased's body, but not so severe; the left hand was also burned, and the fingers charred; the muscles of the lower end of the spine were charred and burned, and the bones exposed; there was a gold earring in the left ear; what remained of the body seemed to be well nourished; there was an abrasion on the inner side of the lips at the right side of the mouth, and the tongue at that side was slightly lacerated; on opening the neck we found the tissues slightly discoloured.

Coroner—Would that be caused by choking?

Dr. Heffernan—Yes, or holding.

Examination resumed—But there were no great marks of violence; on removing the scalp we found extravasated blood on the top of the skull; on removing the skull, we found the vessels of the brain congested, but no injury to the brain substance; the lungs were slightly congested, and the left lung adherent to the chest wall; the spleen was ruptured; we removed the stomach, and found it healthy in appearance.
Coroner—What was your opinion as to the cause of death?
Reply—We believe that shock caused by burns was the cause of death; the rupture of the spleen might have been caused after death; no living person could exist from the severe burns; the whole abdomen was burned, and the contents exposed; the internal organs were sufficiently healthy to carry on life; we are satisfied that the burns were the cause of death; she must have died very soon after the burns.
Dr. Crean—Or probably while they were being inflicted.

The Jury returned the following verdict—"We find that the deceased, Bridget Cleary, late of Ballyvadlea, was found dead on the lands of Tullnaeussane on Friday, 22nd March, '95, and we further find that death was caused by extensive burns, how, or by whom caused we have no evidence to show. We further find that the deceased was alive in her own house on the 13th March, 1895."

The proceedings then terminated."
