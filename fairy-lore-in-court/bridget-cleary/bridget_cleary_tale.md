# A Fairy Changeling?

If you ever see someone acting out of character, you might refer to them as "not being themselves". Or if someone is behaving in an extreme way or irrational way, someone might cry out "they must be out of their mind". And so it has always been. And if you lived in a small community where someone was misbehaving, they might need reigning in somehow; if they were misbehaving really badly, folk might feel they even needed punishing. But even then, there needed to be some way to bring the transgressor back into the fold. Some way of redeeming them, or reconciling them back with that community.

Back in old Ireland, it was common to hear that someone was "away with the fairies" if they were acting a bit odd. Strokes were "fairy strokes". And changelings... well, changelings changed everything: a changeling, a fairy changeling, was a fairy swapped for a real person: a baby, an adult, they looked identical, or almost: there might be a sign, one leg shorter than the other, for example; and they didn't like certain things: iron, fire. The changeling explained a lot. If someone was behaving badly? Well: perhaps it wasn't them; a changeling could provide an explanation for why something wasn't "your fault": a sickly or disabled child might be a changeling, for example; and if you mistreated that child for behaving badly: well, perhaps that was to get the fairy out of them. (There was a counter to that: if you mistreated the changeling, then the fairies in the other world would similarly mistreat the person who had been replaced by the changeling.) So: fairies explained a lot.


though in other cases the fairies might harm you if you crossed them or wronged them in some way

And so it was as it is today: people who are different in some way are often treated as somehow alien. And those differences, well, maybe those differences were because the person was a changeling.

Back in old Ireland, as in old England, and in old Wales, and in old Scotland, people kept chickens. Some women, hen-wives, would keep a small flock of chickens and regularly sell eggs around the neighbourhood. Such a trade could bring the woman of the house an even greater income than her labourer husband earned. Bridget Cleary, a dressmaker by trade, a good profession — she even had her own sewing machine — supplemented her income in just such a way, selling eggs around the way; and with her husband, Michael, a cooper, a barrelmaker, they were comfortably off. And didn't she know it, with her ??hat/ribbon??

They were a bit odd, that couple. When they were just married, he had regularly spent time away from home; "working" he said, but folk knew what men away from home for nights on end got up to. And she, well, she was so friendly with the landlord's man (and they'd perhaps spit at the mention of him). There was something not right about that set up, somehow. And how long had they been married, with no children to show for it. She was eighteen when they wed, and what was she now? Twenty-five? Twenty-six, even?

Bridget and Michael lived in a small labourer's cottage, along with Bridget's father, Patrick (Bolland).

Or how about start from:

In 189??, following a court case in, ?? was sentenced to 20 years for murdering his wife. The charge had been that ...


So what was it about the case that caused Edward Clodd, President of the Folk-Lore society, to write to the Editor of the London *Daily Chronicle*, suggesting that a more lenient sentence should have been applied?

Burning of Brigid Cleary, Ballyvadlea

Local tradition attributes the name. Sliabh na mBan, to the presence of fairy women who occasionally showed themselves to some girl in the neighbourhood of the mountain and then carried her away unknown to her parents, leaving an old hag or fuighleach in her place.

The belief that the fairies had this extraordinary power seems to have existed almost down to our own time, for about 45 years ago a young woman was burned in the district as a witch.

Mrs Brigid Cleary, the unfortunate victim, lived with her husband, Michael, in a cottage at Ballyvadlea, a townsland between Cloneen and Fethard. A few years after her marriage, Mrs Cleary was stricken with a severe illness. Her husband travelled to the foot of the mountain to solicit aid from an herb doctor named Gahan who lived there. The medicine, having been prepared, was given to Mrs. Cleary, but there was no visible improvement in her condition.

By this time the poor woman had become so haggard and worn as a result of her bad health that her husband relatives and neighbours began to think that Brigid Cleary had "gone with the fairies" and that this person whom they were endeavouring to restore to health was an old witch which had been left in her place.
Michael Cleary believed that if he went out on three moonlight nights in succession, he would see his wife riding out of the rath near his house on a white horse. He went out on the scheduled nights, but nobody appeared near the rath. Then began the trials to which the wretched victim was subjected. Brigid was held over the fire while the neighbours asked her.

"Are you a witch or are you a fairy,
Or are you the wife of Michael Cleary"

She was then turned and again questioned. She was given three morsels of bread and as she was unable to swallow them it was considered beyond doubt that she was a fairy. A black handled iron knife was used, as it was believed to be one of the most hated by the fairies.

Having come to the conclusion that it was an old hag who sat by Michael Cleary's fireside willing hands helped to burn Mrs. Cleary in her own house. The charred remains were thrown into an old dyke which was overgrown with briars, and the superstitious people of Ballyvadlea thought they had performed a really praise-worthy act.

The discovery of the body led to the arrest of Michael Cleary and his accomplices.

Their sentences ranged from six to twenty years

Not very long ago there lived in Ballingarry a woman named Brigid Cleary who, before her marriage was a fine, healthy woman. But day by day, after her marriage, she began to grow thinner until at last, she was as thin as a wisp. Her husband was nearly distracted and at length, he sought the advice of his neighbours, who were very innocent, simple-minded people. He told them about his wife, and (they) on hearing it, they immediately concluded that she was gone with the fairies. They advised him to burn her to a cinder and that, then, the real Bridget would come back.

The man agreed with his neighbours and that night he gathered a huge bundle of firewood and put it on the hearth. All the neighbours came and it was not long till they had a great fire blazing. They then got the poor woman and tied her to the crane over the fire. She began to screech and shout with pain, but, it was of no avail and the neighbours kept heaping up the fire and at the same time crying out "Are you Bridget Cleary or is she gone with the fairies". The woman continued to scream and the neighbours continued to heap up the fire, till, in the early hours of the morning, nothing was left but four charred bones hanging from the crane.

When the [?] Guards heard of the tragedy they came to the house and arrested the husband on the charge of murder. But he was not found guilty because the judge said that he was a simple-minded man who believed in fairies and fairytales.

The man who told me this story said that his father was one of the jury at that trial.
