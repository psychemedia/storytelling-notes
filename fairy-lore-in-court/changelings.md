CHANGELINGS BY ANDREW LANG.

The late melancholy events in a peasant family of Tipperary have not only pained and grieved all readers, but have astonished the student of popular beliefs. Not many years ago an unhappy infant was savagely ill-treated by his parents, who had no idea that they were harming their own child, but supposed that they were merely exorcising a substituted fairy brat, a "changeling." In the recent case the actors appear to have been blinded by the same illusions, only in this affair a changeling was thought to have been left in the room of grown-up woman.

This is a singular and, perhaps, unprecedented instance of the fairy belief producing deplorable results in modern practice. It may be worth while to look more closely into an old popular creed, which astonishes us by its persistence. That there exists a subterranean and usually invisible race, akin to our own, which sometimes carries off human prisoners for ever, or till their release, is most ancient opinion. Probably the Rape of Proserpine is our earliest classical instance, and it has a close analogy in the North American myth of Chibiabos, carried off, like Proserpine, by the subterranean folk, and, like her, partially restored: after which, Eleusis, the Mysteries were founded. On the face of it, both fables seem intended to describe the death of vegetation, and its revival in spring. No doubt it may be argued that the belief had no other foundation, and only later was applied to the fairy captures of men, women, and children. But in the origin of *these* tales there must be a more human element. The fairies, who in one form or another people the traditions of almost all known races, are in one respect only ancestral ghosts, living in a blades which is neither heaven, hell, nor purgatory. Among Christian peoples, apparently, the old heathen belief in these shades existed, and, indeed, still exists, behind or beneath the Church's creed to the condition of the baptised dead. A dead man or woman or child usually goes to his own Christian place, but occasionally, oven in lifetime, is carried off by the fairies— that is, practically, the ancestors. But this mortuary character of the fairies is much obscured for us by the confusion of the shades with sportive pixies and little folk spirits unattached, who never were souls of mortals. The fairies of our fairy tales, again, who are generally rather moral and benevolent creatures, may be little older than the end of the seventeenth century, when they received their characteristics from the fancy of Perrault and Madame d'Aulnoy. A godmother of the Maid of Orleans had seen *Fées* beneath the *Beau Mai*, the old oaktree of Domremy. But of fairy godmothers like Cinderella's the children of Domremy probably never 'd. However, into our conceptions of fairies all these and other different classes of fanciful beings are now combined, and that is why we feel it is difficult to understand the most cruel and mournful Irish tragedy.

The unhappy peasants believed that the real woman was under fairy dominion, in fairy realms forlorn, that she would ride a grey horse in the fairy cavalcade, and might be rescued by friends wearing black-hilted knives. In exactly the same way, according to the legend of Aberfoyle, the minister, Mr. Kirk, might have been released had anyone thrown dirk over his head when ho once appeared at a christening party, after his capture by the People of Peace, two hundred years ago. In the old ballad, too, the captive Tamlane may be delivered by anyone who will tear him off the white horse which he rides among the elves. Mr. Kirk himself, in manuscript diary, admits that he is aware of methods by which a prisoner of the fays may be released, but he regards them "superstitions." also, in the same manuscript, speaks of a woman who, after two years' residence in fairyland, was restored to her husband. Gervase of Tilbury long before had recorded similar facts in his "Otia Imperialia." But while in the case of infants the fairies used to leave changeling brat behind, they did not do so when they stole grown-up people, or at least we do not hear of this belief in Scotland. Unluckily, events prove, the opposite belief does exist in Tipperary, and we know too well what came of it. The natural origin of a faith so monstrous is probably not very far to seek. We often talk of this or that person as "a changed man." The primitive explanation of a sudden revolution in character and habits —caused perhaps by disease, by a sunstroke, or other accidents— would be that the man really had been changed, that somebody else had been substituted for him. Thus we have the familiar Chinese tale of the stupid idle lad who suddenly became studious and got a high degree. Of course a friendly ghost had taken his place, say the Chinese, and the fairies who make captures in Ireland or Scotland are, at bottom, only ancestral ghosts. When healthy good-tempered child became peevish, insatiable, bag of skin and bones, clearly he was not the actual child in a decline, but a substituted fairy brat, who had better be roasted on a shovel.

This is intelligible enough, but in most countries men and women, when stolen by fairies, are *not* replaced by changelings. One may venture a guess as to what had really occurred in their case. Physicians, I believe, are not unacquainted with rare instances in which a secondary personality—hysterical, epileptic, or what not—is developed adults. The patient, forgetting who he is and assuming his new personality, is apt to wander away, and perhaps behaves sanely enough at a distance under a changed name and in a fresh occupation. One American case, of a minister (I think) who disappeared and became a tradesman in a remote place, has been published. But an acute American physician has observed that, on the day of his disappearance, this patient had a considerable sum of ready money in his possession! This assuredly does throw a grave doubt on the theory of unconscious and unpremeditated action on his part. The case of "Louis Y.," a man of about three distinct personalities, is familiar to students of morbid psychology. In each of his states he only remembers the prior events of the analogous condition: in one frame he is an atheistic Eadical, in another pious Tory, and he has certainly wandered a good deal in all senses. "If his *bona fides* are admitted" (to quote an author of scanty classical education), such a patient as "Louis Y." is probably the kind of person who gave rise to the belief in fairy captures of adults. He went off, was lost, was somebody else for while, and then he came back in his own familiar personality. Where had he been? *He* did not know — nobody knew; and the Good People were made responsible for that and doubtless for premeditated and conscious disappearances. The Highlander in Mr. Kirk's manuscript, who took back a wife "after two years in Fairyland" was easily satisfied by her explanation of her absence. We can say no more. In the recent Irish tragedy it is not unlikely that the unfortunate woman really had developed some hysterical change in character. But she did not wholly disappear into fairyland, therefore what was left in her place was a changeling. Catholics ought to have called in the aid of a clerical exorcist, when all would have been well. But "the priest is often the last to hear of these things," and recourse was had to the prescriptions of ancient folklore. Peasants are not alone here. As I write comes in the advertisement of book, "Demon Possession and Allied Themes," by Dr. Nevius, "for forty years missionary to the Chinese." "This book is based ... upon a large collection of thoroughly sifted and authenticated facts, showing that demon possession is a common experience of our own day." I cannot criticise a work which I have not read, but I wish that a form of Dr. Nevius's theory had not prevailed in Tipperary.

A FAIRY LEGEND [BY CROFTON CROKER]

It may be considered impertinent were I to explain what is meant by a changeling: both Shakspeare and Spencer have already done so; and who is there unacquainted with the *Midsummer Night's Dream* and the *Fairy Queen*?

Now Mrs. Sullivan fancied that her youngest child had been changed by "faries, theft," to use Spencer's words, and certainly appearances warranted such a conclusion; for in one night her healthy, blue-eyed boy, had become shrivelled up into almost nothing, and never ceased squalling and crying. This naturally made poor Mrs. Sullivan very unhappy; and all the neighbours, by way of comforting her, said that her own child was, beyond any kind of doubt, with the good people, and that one of themselves had been put in his place.

Mrs. Sullivan, of course, could not disbelieve what every one told her, but she did not wish to hurt the thing; for although its face was so withered and its body wasted away to a mere skeleton, it had still a strong resemblance to her own boy; she therefore could not find it in her heart to roast it alive on the griddle, or to burn his nose off with the red-hot tongs, or to throw it out in the snow in the road-side, notwithstanding these, and several like proceedings, were strongly recommended to her for the recovery of her child.

One day, who should Mrs. Sullivan meet but a cunning woman, well known about the country by the name of Ellen Leah (or Grey Ellen). She had the gift, however she got it, of telling where the dead were, and what was good for the rest of their souls; and could charm away warts and wens, and do a great many wonderful things of the same nature.

"You're in grief this morning, Mrs. Sullivan," were the first words of Ellen Leah to her.

"You may say that, Ellen," said Mrs. Sullivan; "and good cause I have to be in grief; for there was my own fine child whipped off from me out of his cradle, without as much as by your leave or ask your pardon, and an ugly dony bit of a shrivelled-up fairy put in his place. No wonder that you see me in grief, Ellen."

"Small blame to you, Mrs. Sullivan," said Ellen Leah; "but are you sure 'tis a fairy?"

"Sure!" echoed Mrs. Sullivan, "sure enough am I to my sorrow, and can I doubt my own two eyes? Every mother's soul must feel for me."

"Will you take an old woman's advice;" said Ellen Leah, fixing her wild and mysterious gaze upon the unhappy mother: and, after a pause, she added, "but may be you'll call it foolish?"

"Can you get me back my child — my own child, Ellen?" said Mrs. Sullivan with great energy.

"If you do as I bid you," returned Ellen Leah, "you'll know." Mrs. Sullivan was silent in expectation, and Ellen continued— "Put down the big pot, full of water, on the fire, and make it boil like mad; then get a dozen new-laid eggs, break them, and keep the shells, but throw away the rest; when that is done, put the shells in the pot of boiling water, and you will soon know whether it is your own boy or a fairy. If you find that it is a fairy in the cradle, take the red hot poker and cram it down his ugly throat; and you will not have much trouble with him after that I promise you."

Home went Mrs. Sullivan, and did as Ellen Leah desired. She put the pot on the fire, and plenty of turf under it, and set the water boiling at such a rate, that if ever water was red hot, it surely was.

The child was lying, for a wonder, quite easy and quiet in the cradle, every now and then cocking his eye, that would twinkle as keen as a star on a frosty night, over at the great fire, and the big pot upon it; and he looked on with great attention at Mrs. Sullivan breaking the eggs, and putting down the eggshells to boil. At last he asked, with the voice of a very old man, "What are you doing, mammy?"

Mrs. Sullivan's heart, as she said herself, was up in her mouth, ready to choke her, at hearing the child speak. But she contrived to put the poker in the fire, and to answer without making any wonder at the words, "I'm brewing, *a vick*" (my son).

"And what are you brewing mammy?" said the little imp:whose supernatural gift of speech now proved beyond question that he was a fairy substitute.

"I wish the poker was red," thought Mrs. Sullivan; but it was a large one, and took a long time heating; so she determined to keep him in talk until the poker was in a proper state to thrust down his throat, and therefore repeated the question.

"Is it what I'm brewing, *a vick*," said she "you want to know?"

"Yes, mammy: what are you brewing?" returned the fairy.

"Egg-shells , *a vick*," said Mrs. Sullivan.

"Oh!" shrieked the imp, starting up in the cradle, and clapping his hands together, "I'm fifteen hundred years in the world, and I never saw a brewery of egg-shells before!" The poker was by this time quite red, and Mrs. Sullivan seizing it, ran furiously towards the cradle; but somehow or other he foot slipped, and she fell flat on the floor, and the poker flew out of her hand to the other end of the house. However, she got up, sithout much loss of time, and went to the cradle intending to pitch the wicked thing that was in it into the pot of boiling-water; when there she saw her own child in a sweet sleep, one of his soft round arms rested upon the pillow: his features were as placid as if their repose had never been disturbed, save the rosy mouth which moved with a gentle and regular breathing.

Who can tell the feelings of a mother when she looks upon her sleeping child. Why should I, therefore, endeavour to describe those of Mrs. Sullivan at again beholding her long-lost boy? The fountain of her heart overflowed with the excess of joy, and she wept; tears trickled silently down ber cheeks, nor did she strive to check them — they were tears not of sorrow but of happiness.

Changelings. —Why are stunted and idiotical children called changelings? —Because was popularly believed that all the fairy children were a little backward of their tongue, and seemingly idiots, and that such children had been changed the fairies. Mr. Pennant, speaking of the fairy oak at Whiteford, relates that poor cottager, who lived near the oak, had a child which grew uncommonly peevish; the parents attributed this to the fairies, and imagined that was changeling. They took the child, put it in cradle, and left it all night beneath the tree, in hopes that the "tylwydd tag," or family of the fairy folk, would restore their own before morning. When morning came they found the child perfectly quiet, and so went away with it quite confirmed in their belief. *Knowledge for the People.*

The Putting Out of the Changeling.

Red John Solan of Killeaden told me of the putting out of the changeling. I also heard the story from another old man. The two men gave the same name to the godfather, and placed the scene of the exorcising in the neighbouring village of Treenbauntrigh.

A child was born there, whose godfather's name was Pat Walsh. Soon after it was born it began to ail, and as the years went on got no better, so that when it was six years old it was as small as a child of three. It was always hungry and very troublesome. At last it took to its bed, and lay there with the face of an old man. It was apparently dying, yet would not die. All the neighbours saw it was not a "right child," and the father and mother knew it as well. Each day people would come in to see it die, but each day it was there grinning at them. Word was brought to Pat Walsh of the state of affairs, and he went over to the house, and up to the bed, and looked at the child. "If you aren't out of this house by night," he said, "I'll put you out with a fork." And he made a mixture (the nature of which was told me), that if thrown on a changeling would make it go. When night came the bed was empty — the child had gone. Before it vanished Pat Walsh went home. He said he would be back in the morning to see if the child was still in the bed. He had a dog with him, a fierce fighter. It was dark when he left the house. When he had crossed two fields he came to a ditch; a thorn bush stood near it. He heard a noise in the ditch, and something jumped out of it at him. What shape it had he could not tell, but his dog rushed towards it and drove it off". It came again at him from the bush. It had no shape that he knew, but was like a big lump. It followed him all the way, jumping at him till he reached the river. Only for the dog it would have killed him. He crossed the river, and was safe. The thing could not come across the water.

The following changeling story was told me by Mary Carty of Drumkeeran, who stated that she had always heard it related as a fact : —

There was a girl living at Kilbride, three miles from Drumkeeran, and she went one day in harvest to mind a baby for a neighbour who was out getting hay, and she was there some time rocking the child. She got sick and cross that night, and she was that way for three years. She used to tell the people to come to her at sunset, and she would tell them about their people who were dead; and she said she could show them a certain priest who had died, riding about on a white horse; but the people were afraid to go and see the sight. There was a little boy to whom she took a great liking, and would have showed him more than anyone, only he was kept from her. At the end of three years she got very bad and sick one night, and said goodbye to the people, and said she had to be going to a place called Kilbride near Dublin, that there was a redhaired boy to be taken and she had to be there, and as she was going she would tell them how to get back their own. The mother was to go to a certain little byre upon a hill between twelve and one o'clock at night, to cut a drain round the byre with a black-hafted knife, to get a lot of hens' dirt and mix it up, and between twelve and one to stand inside the byre and throw three dashes of the dirt out of the door; and Avhen that was done she was to shout. The mother did this, and then came home; and in the morning it was their own daughter that got up and began to tell them about people who were dead. She asked for a drink; and when her mother gave it to her she forgot all about the three years and began to talk as of yesterday and minding the child.

Here is another changeling story : —

The Fairy Blacksmith.

There was a poor man in co. Leitrim, and he had a sickly son, who was a fine boy in the commencement till he was about three years of age, v.hen he got ill and donny; and and they couldn't know what was the cause. He remained so for four or five years more, and gave all sorts of annoyance to his poor mother and father, screeching and screaming for a thing to eat at all times.

One day his father went to the forge to get his loy irons laid with the smith. It happened that the smith did one iron remarkably well, and there was a flaw in the other, but the man never noticed it. When he came home with the irons, "Daddy," says the sickly little lad, "show me them irons." "What do you know about irons?" says the father. He still persevered to look at them; and to please him, his mother handed them to him. The lad looked at them: "Daddy," says he, "this is a good one, but that one is no good; did he throw those two irons on the ground when he did them?" "No" says the father; "he gave me this one in my hand, and he threw the other one on the floor." "The one he threw on the floor," says the little lad, "is a good one : but the one he gave you in your hand is cracked, and nearly broken; and that's the reason he handed it to you, because he knew it wouldn't sound clear on the floor. Go back with it now, and tell him it^s a bad iron, and to make it better for you."

The father went back again to the smith with the iron and said: "Why did you give me a broken iron, and didn't do it right for me?" "Who told you that?" says the smith. "A small little child I have of my own; and he said that because it was bad you handed it into my hand, and the good one you threw on the floor to me."

"Who told you that?" says the smith.

"Isn't it the case?" says he.

"Well," says the smith, "whoever told you that is as good a blacksmith as I am, and if I knew who told you, I would give you five pounds; because it is a league among all blacksmiths."

Says the man: "It's a sickly little child of my own."

"Well, if he is," says the smith, "he's as good a blacksmith as me."

So the man was not thankful to him to say his child would be a fairy.

"Well," says the smith, "stop here till it bees dark, and surely your wife will begin to scold you for stopping out so late. Tell them you could be home half-an-hour sooner, or an hour, but that you were surprised looking at the fort above the house on fire, and that it's all consumed."

So he went home : and the wife began: "What kept you out so late? You have your whole day spent with them two irons now." "I could be home sooner," says he; "but I was surprised to see the fort on fire, and now it's all consumed. I stood an hour looking at it."

"My word!" says the lad in the cradle, "my bellows and tools are all burnt," and out with him, and he never came back.

THE FAIRY CHANGELING.

One evening, a man was coming home late, and he passed a house where two women stood by a window, talking.

"I have left the dead child in the cradle as you bid me," said one woman, "and behold here is the other child, take it and let me go;" and she laid down an infant on a sheet by the window, who seemed in a secret sleep, and it was draped all in white.

"Wait," said the other, "till you have had some food, and then take it to the fairy queen, as I promised, in place of the dead child that we have laid in the cradle by the nurse. Wait also till the moon rises, and then you shall have the payment which I promised."

They then both turned from the window. Now the man saw that there was some devil's magic in it all. And when the women turned away he crept up close to the open window and put his hand in and seized the sleeping child and drew it out quietly without ever a sound. Then he made off as fast as he could to his own home, before the women could know anything about it, and handed the child to his mother's care. Now the mother was angry at first, but when he told her the story, she believed him, and put the baby to sleep — a lovely, beautiful boy with a face like an angeL

Next morning there was a great commotion in the village, for the news spread that the first-born son of the great lord of the place, a lovely, healthy child, died suddenly in the night, without ever having had a sign of sickness. When they looked at him in the morning, there he laid dead in his cradle, and he was shrunk and wizened like a little old man, and no beauty was seen on him any more. So great lamentation was heard on all sides, and the whole country gathered to the wake. Amongst them came the young man who had carried off the child, and when he looked on the little wizened thing in the cradle he laughed Now the parents were angry at his laughter, and wanted to turn him out.

But he said, "Wait, put down a good fire," and they did so.

Then he went over to the cradle and said to the hideous little creature, in a loud voice before all the people —

"If you don't rise up this minute and leave the place, I will burn you on the fire; for I know right well who you are, and where you came from."

At once the child sat up and began to grin at him; and made a rush to the door to get away; but the man caught hold of it and threw it on the fire. And the moment it felt the heat it turned into a black kitten, and flew up the chimney and was seen no more.

Then the man sent word to his mother to bring the other child, who was found to be the heir, the lord's own son. So there was great rejoicing, and the child grew up to be a great lord himself, and when his time came, he ruled well over the estate; and his descendants are living to this day, for all things prospered with him after he was •saved from the fairies.
