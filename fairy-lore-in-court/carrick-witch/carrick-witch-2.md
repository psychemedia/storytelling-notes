*VARIETIES.*

Cows and Witches.— The reason is plain why the plague of witches is by all accounts more severely felt in the dairy than in any other department of rural economy. The Ayran idea, that the rain clouds were cows, has been well preserved among the Northern nations. Hence it is a common superstition in Germany, that fire kindled by lighting can only be extinguished with cow's milk, cow's hair, or cow's dung. Read in its natural sense, the proposition is, that flames kindled by heavenly fire can only be quenched by the waters of heaven. It is also very common opinion, that rain and dew, the milk of heavenly cows, are capable of increasing the milk of earthly cows; hence a dewy May morning is welcomed as giving promise of a good dairy year. On such a morning witches go into the field, brush the dew from the grass, and collect it in linen cloths, which they squeeze into their milk churns, to the manifest increase of the butter. In North Germany it is customary when the cow* are driven out to pasture for the first time in spring, to tie green Maybush to the tail of the foremost cow, that she may gather up the dew with it and so yield plenty of milk. On the same occasion the farm wives in Aberdeenshire tie red thread round the cows tails, to preserve the animals from witchcraft; and German herdsmen lay a woman's red apron, or a brood axe covered with a woman's red stocking before the threshold of the cow house, and make the animal step over it. But it is no easy matter to guard against the secret practices of the witch. There was a farmer in Caseburg whose cows gave no milk, though he fed them ever so well; so that at last he sent for a wise man to see what he could do for them. The wise man went into the cow house, looked at the cows, and saw at once what was the matter. They were bewitched. So he went about the village to look for the witch, and at last he saw the neighbour's wife standing in her own cow house, at the wall nsarest to the farmer's. She had stuck a broom handle into the wall, with a bucket hanging from it, and was milking the broomstick, which gave milk like a natural udder. Thus, then, this witch was caught in the fact. The wise man threatened her terribly, and from that day forth the farmer had no cause to complain of his cows.— In Scotland, witches were supposed to have the power of supplying themselves with milk from their neighbours cattle by a very simple though insidious process. Procuring a small quantity of hair from the tail of every cow within her reach, the vile wretch twisted it up into a rope, on which she tied a knot for each cow. At this she tagged in the usual manner of milking a cow, pronouncing at the same time unhallowed incantations, at which tbh milk would stream abundantly into her pail.— *Kelly's Indo-European Tradition.*

CASE OF WITCHCRAFT. (FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDEMNT.)

Carricn-on-Suir, Thursday.— The usual fortnightly petty sessions was held today, before Samuel Hanna, R M, chairman, The Right Hon. the Earl of Busborough, Carberry Scully, T B Wilson, W D Despard, and T Lalor, D L.

THe following gentlemen occupied seats on the bench:— Dr Purcell, medical inspector, Dr Ryan, Rev Mr Ridgeway, Mr O'Donnell, chairman of the Town Commissioners, Mr R Fehon, and Mt John Bushe, son of the late Chief Justice Bushe.

The court house, a small building in that part of the town called Carrickmore, was densely crowded, in consequence of the investigation into the charges preferred against the woman, Mary Doheny, who was placed fa the dock for obtaining money under falee pretences.

She was represented by Mr Vowell.

The first witness called was Sub-Constable Reeves, who deposed that he was a member of the police force, and had been stationed in Carrick-on-Suir, where he became acquainted with the prisoner at the bar about fifteen months ago, when she came to treat a child of his who was suffering from fits. He knew William Mullins, his wife's father, who is dead for the past three years; he was aware of the fact from seeing his corpse at his own house, and seeing it taken away for interment at Rathcormack; he was told by the defendant Doheny that Mullins had come to life, and she asked him to come with her to Knockroe; he went before her, accompanied by his son; she was coming up to where they were standing, and, pointing in a particular direction, asked him if he saw anything; he said yes, he saw his father-in law, who was standing at about twenty yards' distance (great laughter); he was not frightened; he thought the case a rare and a curious one to come before a court of justice; he was acquainted with his father-in-law for sixteen years; at the time he saw him he was standing in the field with a stick in his hand; it was daylight when they went to the field, about eight o'clock in the evening; he did not speak to his father-in-law; he believed that he had now come to life; within the last four months food was sent to him, consisting of bread, batter, and tea, once in the twenty-four hours; never gave any clothing, either by Doheny or his wife's niece, but he believed some had been sent by his wife; on one occasion Doheny got a penny from him for tobacco for old Mullins (laughter); Doheny told him not to speak to the vision which he beheld; was satisfied that it was his father-in-law; his son William died in April, 1862; he was then about nine years of age; saw him about three months ago in a waste building belonging to a man named Duggan, opposite Mr Jepson's gate; Doheny told him to go there and that he would see some person' saw his sister-in-law, Margaret Power, standing next to the window in Duggan's house; she is dead; did not speak to her; got some letters by his son Terence and one also by Mrs. Duggan; his son is eight years of age; the letters he alluded to came from Captain James Power, who died ten years ago; never saw Captain Power, but believed he is in the other world; old Muillins had been in Captain Power's employment and the Captain was very fond of him; was told that Captain James is at present in the moat at Ballydile; walked in at Ballydile; went with his son to the moat; walked in before him and remained for about a quarter of an hour; had given him a letter addressed to Captain James Power; when his son came back from the moat he told him that he had a reply for him; the reply was folded in clean linen handkerchief; his son had it in his bosom, but said that he could not give it to him until they got back to the house; when he returned he handed him a letter; could not say if the letter produced in court is the same, as none of the letters had been dated; had been told or promised that he would get land in the County Waterford: but the particular locality was not mentioned; in one of the letters from Captain James Power he got a ring, which he believed to have been gold; hadn't it about him, but believed is was in his wife's possession; she never wore the ring; some of the food sent for the sustenance of the departed was returned, new potatoes being exchanged for old ones; at one time some eggs that he sent to his little boy were sent back as they were too strong for him.

When cross-examined by Mr Vowell, the witness reiterated the statement that he saw his father-in-law in the field, at Knockroe, and that he was quite satisifed he was alive or coming to life; he saw his sister-in-law, Margaret Power, and his deceased son standing at the window of Duggan's house, but did not address them; he went near the window, and observed that his son had grown considerably; he wore the same clothes, but they did not appear to be worn out.

Mr. Vowell— Do you men to say he wore the same clothes that he died in? 

Witness— He did.

Mr. Vowell— Why, did he die with his clothes on?

Mrs. Reeves—Lord help us! he did, he did.

Witness— Yes, he died in his chair; he was then only about seven years of age; when I saw him at the window, I thought he looked pale and sickly, but he was always a delicate child; I am sure Captain Power is not alive, but I believe he is in the moat; at Ballydile I believe my people in-law are with the "gentry," or, as we commonly call them, "the good people". I expect to get gold from them when they return to life; my son is dead three or four years; Margaret Power died seven years ago; she was dressed also; she did not speak to me; I was looking at her for full ten minutes; I believe she was alive at the time of her appearance; my son did not ask me to come with him.

Mrs. Reeves, wife of Constable Reeves, deposed that Mrs Doheny first came to her in reference to the curing of her child, who was suffering from fits; the father, she said, who died about three years ago, appeared to her at twelve o'clock at night in her own house, but she did not speak to him. He led her to believe that he would could to her again in perfection; she was in bed at the time, but not asleep; told the circumstance as is occurred, in the morning; did not speak to Mrs. Doheny in reference to any matter but the illness ot her child up to that period; when she became aware that her father was in life, she sent him a night dress and a pair of stockings; she also sent him some food through Mrs. Doheny, which consisted of bread, tea and new milk; the tea was not liked at first; heard her three sisters speaking to him; their names were Margaret, who died seven years ago, Ellen, who died eleven years ago, and Bridget, who died three and a half years ago; these were speaking to him at her door; it was at her suggestion that the food was sent; she merely asked Mrs Doheny what quality of food she should send, and she told her bread, butter, and such like.

To Mr. Wilson—I never got drinks or doses of any description from the defendent; she gave me some herbs in mil for my child; I never gave her a shilling for the dead people; never paid her for curing my child or attempting to cure her; the only money I ever gave her was a penny; I got several letters through my son, by Mrs Doheny, and by my niece; I kept the letters until last Wednesday week, when Mrs Doheny came to me and said they were required back by the family, but that she wou!d return them to me again at a proper time; she told me my sister was alive; at one time she said my son was too delicate to eat the new potatoes and eggs which hed been sent; I changed the diet next, and sent some tea; after a fortnight a quantity of tea was returned, to be replaced by fresh tea; she believed everything she was saying to be the truth; she also was shown Tom Sheehan, who when in the flesh had been a friend of her husband's.

Cross-examined by Mr. Vowell—Captain Power wrote the letters for my father who, did not know how to write himself. Captain Power is in the moate at Ballydile. Tom Sheehan gave the first letter that we got to my son. He died some time ago. Mrs. Doheny was present when my son brought the letter into the house. I did not open it, but I said—"Who can this letter be from?" Mrs. Doheny remarked that it must be from Captain James Power, because he was in the moate at Ballydile. I heard my sister Margaret speaking to me three times. I did not answer her. It was about nine o'clock at night. I believe she was then with the "gentry," or "good people." She is living with them now fm their own state. I knew my sister's voice. My son was talking to me for three quarters of an hour. I did not believe he was on earth as an earthly person, but that he was one of the "good people" or "gentry." I cannot tell why I did not ask him to come in. I believe my father is living now, and when the proper time comes round that he will come back to me.

James Hayes was sworn, and deposed that he had been a policeman, and was stationed in Carrick-on-Suir; he left the police force about two months ago, as he had become embarrassed, thinking he could pay his debts better by working at his trade; knows Mrs. Doheny, to whom he often gave charity; had heard of Tom Sheehan and and William Mullins, but did not know them personally; from the description he got of the former, he believes he saw him standing on a wall near Duggan's house (here the witness decribed very accurately the particular pose of the ghostly visitant); did know `[sic]` William Mullins or William Reeves, except according to the description given him by Mrs Doheny; went out to a field at the rere of the courthouse towards the railway, accompanied by Reeves and Mrs Doheny some months ago; could not say if Reeves or Doheny pointed out the direction to him, but whichever them directed his attention to it, he certainly saw the figure of a man in the field; he believed that man to have been William Mullins, but could only conjecture so from the description he got; gave Mrs Doheny food on more than one occasion; she never directly promised him that he would get land; believed he said something to that effect in his examination on Friday last, but it was a mistake; heard her alluding to the fact that Reeves would come in for land, and thinks she intimated that he would also.

To Mr, Heard, sub-inspector—I never got a bottle of medicine from the defendant; I never gave her a shilling for a bottle of any particular stuff; I made a copy of the letter produced at the request of Mary Doheny and Mrs Reeves; the original I believe was sent to Captain Power, and signed by sub-constable Reeves.

The letter alluded to was read by Hayes, but it was a perfectly unconnected fumble of mere nonsense.

On being cross-examined by Mr. Vowell—Hayes said that he considered he was clear in his senses, and that if he was ever "hesy" he was not aware of the fact; he saw a ghost before; it was that of a frined of his named Crowly, who resided in the county Cork; saw Sheehan, or a person whom he believed to have been Sheehan from a description he got of him, between the hours of 8 and 10 o'clock; he did not think that too early for a ghost to come out (great laughter); it was at 11 o'clock at night that he saw Crowly.

The informations of a young woman named Ellen Walsh were read to her, by which it appeared that she wrote the letters which were handed into court, and which letters purported to be from Captain Power and other deceased friends. She got fourpence a piece for the long letters, and twopence and threepence for the short ones.

Miss Doran, on being sworn, deposed that the woman Doheny came into her house and asked her sister to write a letter for her; her sister being busy, when she (Mrs Doheny) asked her to write it, which she did, not knowing for what or for whom it was intended.

Only a limited number of the witnesses were called, and Mr. Vowell briefly addressed the Bench for the prisoner. He described the whole thing from beginning to end as a wretched farce, which he was quite sure would not admit of reproduction, and in which he wished the curtain should fall immediately. He thought there was not a particle of evidence to prove that the woman had obtained the food and money under false pretences, they having been voluntarily tendered by the parties themselves, and on these grounds he would ask their worships to deal with the case summarily.

The magistrates, however, were unanimous in sending her for trial before the Chairman of the Quarter Sessions, at Clonmel, next month.

The prisoner, who listened attentively to the evidence adduced, fainted several times before the proceedings were brought to a close, and had to be removed from the dock by the constables. She had an infant in her arms. This evening she was brought up from Carrick, and safely lodged in *durance vile* in Clonmel gaol, where she will await her trial.

Carrick-on-Suir, Friday.— Sub-constable Reeves and ex-Constable Hayes, together with Mrs Reeves and the other parties still continue to their firm belief in all that the *soi disant* Mrs Mary Doheny, has either said or done during her intimacy with them. The prisoner is a low sized, small-featured, cunning-looking woman, and appears perfectly competent to dupe a dozen such confiding mortals as those she has had dealings with. The Captain Power whose name figures so prominently in the several depositions made before the magistrates is, or rather was when *in carne*, the grandfather or granduncle (we are not quite certain which) of the present Edward de la Poer, Esq, D L, of Gurteen. Mrs Doheny told Mr Jepson, one of the presiding justices at the first investigation, that she would raise the spirit of his deceased father if he would permit her; but Mr Jepson declined the pleasure of an interview under such circamstances. The Rev. Mr Power, one of the local clergymen, endeavoured to persuade the woman to abandon her foolish practices, but without avail. She offered him a small bottle containing some liquid to drink out of it, assuring him that if he drank some of it he would know just as much as Reeves! The moate alluded to in the evidence brought forwarded, appears to have been a sort of 'general post office' for the transmission of letters between the living and the dead, or rather to speak technically, the "gentry," or good people, who are not believed to be absolutely defunct, but inhabiting a sort of middle sphere. There was a kind of underground passage in this moate, tunnelled through the earth, and having openings at both ends. The letters addressed by Sub-constable Reeves and others, to the departed were shoved in at one end of this tunnel (we will call it, so far want of a better name), and the replies were produced in due time at the other end, Mrs D. acting as post mistress, extraordinary, sometimes delivering the answers in person to Reeves and co., at other times sending them by Reeves' young son. The whole affair forms the subject of extensive discussion in the neighbourhood of Carrick and Clonmel.

"WITCHCRAFT" AND ITS CONSEQUENCES

Extraordinary Scene In A Petty Sessions Court.

*(From our Special Reporter.)*

Carrick-on-Suir, Thursday.

The second part of this extraordinary drama was enacted in the petty sessions court-house at Carrick-on-Suir on this day, and it would seem that the public interest it excited at the outset has been gaining additional strength every day. At present, the story of the Enchantress and the bewitehed Policeman forms the chief topic of local gossip, and is discussed in the highest circles. The court-house, for hours before the arrival of the magistrates, was besieged by an immense throng of persons. The doors were kept closed until near the hour for opening the court. When they were unlocked, the rush of people inside was such that in a few minutes the gallery, the jurors' boxes, the hall, even the bench itself was thronged to suffocation. Magistrates and other gentlemen came from long distances to listen to this marvellous case, some—it must be confessed—impelled by curiosity to see the reputed "witch" herself! At eleven o'clock the court was formally opened. On the bench were the following—Samuel Hanna, Esq., R.M., presiding; the Right Hon. the Earl of Besborough, Thomas Lalor, Esq., D.L.; Thomas B. Wilson, Esq., J.P.; Carbry Scully, Esq., J.P., Wm. Despard, Esq., J.P., C. Sadleir, Esq., J.P. There were also, W. H. Hemsworth, Esq., County Inspector; A. W. H. Heard, Esq., S.I.; Dr. Purcell, P.L.I.; Mr. MacDonnell, Captain Purcell, L.I.V.; Dr. O'Ryan, J. M. Melville, Esq., John Bushe, Esq., Dublin, and several other gentlemen.

Mary Doheny, the prisoner, was placed in the dock. She wore, wrapped around her, a red shawl, and had in her arms an infant only a few months old. "There lave me alone, jintlemen, and never fear I'll go in quietly" she said, as the police were about to shove her into the grated enclosure as quickly as possible, as if they were afraid she would slip through their fingers, and vanish from their sight. But no, there she stood facing the crowd just like an ordinary mortal in a similar predicament. Strange that she, who professed to have the power of summoning spirits from the vasty deep, dragging them forth from their distant tombs, could be kept by a few planks of timber of one inch thickness.

Beside the witness table were seated the several persons who were said to be, and according to their own sworn testimony, have actually been under the bewitching influence of the prisoner, Mary Doheny. They presented a melancholy spectacle, and certainly no one can read the evidence we subjoin without becoming assured of the mischief which infatuation had already wrought. There were some features in the case excessively ludicrous. It was something very novel, indeed almost incredible, to find a police constable, a man of 22 years' service, who had lived through the callous matter-of-fact atmosphere of a barrack life, accustomed to look at things not as they seemed, and to reason with sagacious ingenuity—to find such a man confidentially informing the court of his interviews with relations restored to life, and of his visits to the dead-letter office in the Moate of Ballydine, where he dispatched letters to Captain James Power, and received replies from the other world. Well, Sub-Constable Joseph Reeves, his wife, his niece, his child, his friend Hayes (the ex-policeman), —bewitched as they all have been—are not, after all, objects of such wonderment. Home has moved amongst the Courtly, and one Imperial ear has listened to his messages from the other world. Aye, Rome itself thought it prudent—dreading, we suppose, *his* power—to politely, but still firmly, intimate its desire for his departure. Biology and Clairvoyance have had their successful run of mystery through the most learned circles; and even in Santiago has not a parallel been found for the establishment of a direct communication with the other world. We are, however, digressing from the proceedings connected with the trial.

Joseph Reeves, who was dressed in the ordinary uniform of the force, was, on being sworn, examined by Mr. Hanna, R.M. You are a sub-constable of police? Yes. Do you know the defendant, Mrs. Doheny? I do, your worship, that is she in the dock. How did you first become acquainted with her? About 18 months ago she began attending my child; I am not aware of the nature of her illness, but she was subject to fits, and used not to sleep before Mary Doheny gave her the medicine; now she is able to get some rest; the bottle which she took must, therefore, have done her good.

Do you know William Mullins? Yes; he is my wife's father; in May last three years he died in my house, and I buried him in Rathgormack; my wife attended the funeral; I did not; I saw him, however, lying dead, and conveyed out of the house.

Do you know anything of him now? I am told he came to life again.

Who told you that? Well she asked me——

Who is "she"? The prisoner, sir; she asked me and my son to go with her up to Knockroe; we went, and remained there ten minutes; she then asked me to look in some direction; I did so, and pointing down the field she asked me did I see anything; I said I see my father-in-law, William Mullins.

Now, do you really believe you saw him?—I do believe I saw him, for he was no more than twenty yards from me.

Were you frightened (laughter) when you saw the dead man rising?—I was not—(renewed laughter), in which the constable himself joined, adding—It is such a rare case to come before a court that it is no wonder people laugh; but, your worship, there are instances of the like occurring. Other people who died have come to life, but not to my own personal knowledge.

Perhaps you were deceived in this instance. How is it you are so sure that it was William Mullins you saw? I knew him, sir. I knew him well, and have been acquainted with him for about fifteen or sixteen years while he was first alive.

What became of the man—where did the apparition go to?

Mr. Vowell (who appeared for the prisoner's husband)—The man, your worship, not the apparition! (laughter).

Witness—I left him standing on the field; he had a stick in his hand.

What hour was this? It was about eight o'clock in the evening, and perfect daylight.

Did you ever send him anything since he died?—Not since he died, for the man is alive! I only heard that he died.

Are you not perfectly sure that Wm. Mullins died and was buried? I am.

Did you send him any food since you went to Knockroe? I did; about three or four months ago I sent him bread, butter, and tea?

Well, did he eat them? I can't swear to anything I didn't see, and I was not to the fore, when the food was given to him.

How often did you send the food? Once in the twenty-four hours regularly. It was sent by the woman in the dock, and by my wife's niece. I believe there was a pair of stockings sent to my people-in-law, and I gave her a penny for tobacco for Wm. Mullins (laughter).

Did anything ever happen about the potatoes?—They came back once; Mary Doheny said that neither my father-in-law nor my three sisters-in-law (who also died), nor my son (who died when he was seven years of age), could partake of them. My son William died in April, and I saw him in the waste house belonging to Mr. Duggan, and opposite Mr. Jephson's, the magistrate.

Who told you he had come to life?—Mrs. Doheny told me to go to this place and see whether I would find anyone there. I went and saw my son standing with one of my sisters-in-law, who died seven years ago, but is now alive. They came to the window, but I did not speak to them; I received some letters from my son, Terence Reeves, who is in court, and about eight years of age; they were from William Mullins, but I consider it was Captain James Power who wrote them; he died about ten years ago; the poor captain was very fond entirely of my father-in-law (laughter).

What world is Captain Power in? If he is not on this world he must be in the other world; I could not say whether *he* was ever seen alive on this earth after being buried; I was told to write to Capt. James, and when I wrote I brought the letter, accompanied by my son, and this woman, [Mary Doheny], in the direction of Ballydine moat; this little chap of mine went up to the moat, and came back in about ten minutes, and asked me for the letter I had; I gave it to him, and I saw him going into the fort, and coming out in about a quarter of an hour; he called me to come towards him, for I was at a little distance from the moat, and I did so; I asked him for the letter, but he said, "no, I can't give it to you until I go home; he had it rolled up in a handkerchief, and inside the breast of his coat; the letter I wrote was written in red ink, and the answer I got back was in black ink; the red letter I wrote upon a *sixpenny* stamped paper. Mrs. Doheny told me such was required; I paid sixpence for a stamp at the post-office, and put it on a sheet of paper; the stamp came back to me out of the moate, but the letter was kept.

Mr. Heard, S.I., here produced a large bundle of letters from *this* to the *other* world, and from the *other* world to *this*—written, some on "pink-edged," "wave-note," and embossed paper. Only one letter, strange to say, was written on *foolscap*! These letters were all found in the prisoner's box, tied up carefully in white cotton bags strung with leather. They had been handed into Mary Doheny's possession at the prisoner's own request. There was an attempt made to decipher some of this correspondence, but the constabulary failed, as it was nothing but the most incoherent nonsense. The following is one of those letters which the witness and his family believe came to them from the deceased, Captain James Power, together with the reply! Our readers surely would not desire to wade through fifty such:—

My dear frend—I am going to give you warning on this Night that you are not to speak to me on the journey. We expect untill you call to the Lodging where the family is for to deliver What We have for you there Both you And the Rest of the friends, and We Cannot mention to you What night of the week is that for that was my orders on this day by Captain James Power. But now I am letting you know all things is right, and we are to go on the old journey to-night on the strength of your sister-in-Law for the Return of Husband and Children, And that is all the delay on you When you shall blame an owner to your own Wishes. Let James know from me that he is not disappointed in What he is Wating for, that according to What i have said to him 'tis at an end now. My dear & kind friend get James Bourk to think on them that was in prison. At our Return he shall convey his friend William Mullins home to his own door, And that before the week is at an end, and not mention the day. My Dear And kind friend Eliza, i am thankful to you for your letter you bestowed on me, for i Receive it with great Rejoicement, and God will be your guide With What we are bestowing on you And on the kind widow, for she never will be forgot. few days in this week will put you to an end to be labouring for others. My dear and kind friend let Pat Fitzpatrick see to this that we are sending him our compliments for the belife he kept, and for what he had done. The exposing of What was said in the publick street at the hour of 10 o'clock took a little on us, When you were present; but thanks be to God We are able to Clear all that."

"Dear James—You were a great Burden on us through the means of a tossation. there were never A disappointment took Place but you were the instagation of it. And what you shall Require to so you shall se it yourself, And the young youth, tery, shall go three nigts to the old ground, And you shall meet me. in your mind you had an envy spite for the loyal And trye friend; but you thought you were a service to joe; but you were not, but a heavy disappointment to him; but Please the Lord i hope it twill be no more. for now we have Pardoned you. This in the 3rd offer the captain said that you disappointed the brave family. And what you done on yesterday was no more service to them while they were sitting, no more than if you did it. What we would not fear Belife it would be no service to us. now i hope you shall not Change no more in your mind, for from us great comfit you shall find in in the next to the chair your friend sat with Captain James. Now your pardon is Returned, hoping you never will be a cross again."

Examination resumed by the court—About this gold which was promised to you? I know nothing about it, but I was told that when my people-in-law would come they'd bring plenty with them; I had a promise of getting a tract of land.

Mr. Vowell—Part of the Marquis of Waterford's estate was it? I don't know but it might be there; the place was not named. [To the court].—Mrs. Doheny brought me a ring, which appears to be gold, and a letter; they were sent to me by Captain James Power, but I was told not to say anything about who they came from.

Where is that ring? My wife has it.

Mr. Vowell—I'll engage she is wearing it? Witness (impressively), no she never wears it, she was told not to do so; I remember, in reference to some eggs that were sent to my sister-in-law and child by Mrs. Doheny, that they objected to use them as they were too strong (laughter).

Mr. Vowell—I'm really sorry, and in sober sadness I say it, to find you in such a plight.

Witness—On what account?

How long have you been in the force? Twenty two years.

I am sorry you are so near leaving it! Well, sir, it will be no loss to the force (laughter).

Why did you not go to shake hands with your son, and your sister-in-law, when you met them in Duggan's? I did not because they were not alive then.

Not alive, did you not see them there? Yes.

Surely you have no doubt on your mind about their having come to life? They are alive now, but they were not then; I cannot say any more about them; my son and people-in-law are there confined in that waste house for three months, but they cannot come out.

Who sent them there?—The man who brought them to the surface, and that man, it is my sworn belief, is Captain James Power; and he will keep them there until the time is cut out for them to leave it.

Do you know where Captain James Power is?—I do; he is in the fort or moat of Ballydine.

How do you know that?—Well, did you not ever hear, sir, that there is a "Gentry" on earth.

Well, I hope there is! (laughter).—Witness: I mean a gentry that you cannot see!

You mean the "Good people"?—Well, call them whatever you like.

Is it to the good people you trust to get the crock of gold?—No; when my people-in-law come back, I am told they will bring gold with them. There are five of them who were buried now alive; of this I have not the slightest doubt.

Mr. Lalor, D.L.—What clothes had your son on when you saw him in Duggan's?—He was dressed in the clothes he always wore when alive.

Surely, he did not die suddenly, with his every-day clothes on?

Mrs. Reeves (from the body of the court)—He did! he did!

Witness—My wife will tell you; I know he died sitting in a chair by the kitchen fire. He was seven years of age when he died, and that is seven years ago. When I saw him he appeared to me to be a great deal taller.

In fact (said Mr. Vowell, resuming the cross-examination), the seven-years-old had become a ten-years-old. From what you say it would appear he was taken good care of where he was?—It appeared to me that he was! (laughter;) but still he had the same puny and delicate look he always wore.

What about the clothes; were they much worn?—They did not appear to have been worn at all.

Or brushed?—They were as well brushed as ever—a poor man's child is not expected to have well brushed clothes; he was bare-headed, the same as I am now. When we went towards the window where they were standing, my little son, Terry, saw him first, and said, "There he is, father—there he is!"

But what about this "Crock of Goold?" Would you take it if you got it?—Witness: I'll engage you would! aye, and close your fist on it, too, if any one were to give you four or five sovereigns; and so would any one.

To be sure they would. Now what about the dress your sister-in-law had on; had she a crinoline on?—No; they were not worn when she died! I was ten minutes looking at them when I came away with my son Terence. The little chap, when he brought the letters to the moat, told me that he used to put them on a shelf, and after a time he would see the hand reaching the answer back.

I am afraid it is the story of the Prodigal Son, "My son that was dead and is alive, was lost and is found," is running in your mind, Reeves?—No, that is quite a different thing.

To the Court—The letters produced have no date, nor are they addressed.

Mr. Vowell—Directions are not necessary upon letters going to the other world (laughter).

Mary Reeves, wife to the last witness, is next called and sworn. After describing how she became acquainted with the prisoner, she continued—Before this William Mullins, my father, came to me one night, he returned alive to the earth, about the hour of 12 o'clock, and said he would come back to this world in perfect form; he came in his own appearance to me in my own house; I was in bed at the time, but I was not asleep; this was about the time the child was curing; I had no conversation with Mrs. Doheny up to that time, but have often had since; I sent my father a night-dress and a pair of stockings; nothing else.

"Nothing else!" did you not send him something to eat? I did, of course! I gave the food to Mrs. Doheny for him; that is the woman standing in the dock; I sent bread, tea, and new milk to my father, my child and my three sisters, all of whom had died; Margaret Mullins died seven years ago, Ellen eleven years, and Bridget two years and a half since; I know they are alive, for I heard their voices, and Mrs. Doheny told me.

[This witness was asked repeatedly the question by Mr. Wilson, J.P.—"Did any one tell you to send the food to your father and sisters?" before she could be made to acknowledge that the prisoner had done so.—At first she stated that she heard a voice at night; again she stated that it came to her at night, and at last she admitted that Mary Doheny told her what food would be required].

The dead people took very little—said witness—at first. Whatever I gave was of my own free will and consent. My father told me to send the food; of course I knew he required it. The woman in the dock gave herbs to my child, but neither myself or my husband got anything from her; I never gave her any money except one penny. I kept all the letters (produced) until Mrs. Doheny told me they were required to go back to the people who sent them; she told me that my sisters were alive, and I believed her; it was mentioned in one of the notes that they would come back and bring their share with them, and I was also told that I was to get land when they would return to earth; Mrs. Doheny told me to send tea, bread, and new milk to them; no later than yesterday my child saw his uncle Tom Sheehan standing with my father, William Mullins.

Cross-examined by Mr. Vowell—I think my father is alive, and to the best of my belief it was Captain James Power who wrote these letters, for I have seen his writing before he died.

Is he dead now? He is, sir; but he is in the moat of Ballydine; his bones were buried in Rathgormack.

Who told you he was there? Mrs. Doheny, and my child got the letters from him there.

To Mr. Wilson—These eleven letters [marked] came, Mrs. Doheny told me, from Captain Power; Tom Sheehan gave the first letter to my son; he died some years ago; Captain Power is not on this earth in the flesh, but he is looking after the rest.

To Mr. Vowell—The Captain is now sitting at the moat, and if he called his hounds together they would come to him; I suppose I heard some of my sisters call me at my own door, "Mary! Mary! Mary!" three times by name; I did not answer; it was moonlight, and I knew they were with *the gentry* then; I have not the slightest doubt that they are alive now; my son William, who died, was talking to me lately at my own door for three quarters of an hour; I did not ask him inside; I would if I could; one of the good people called him away; it was sometime after my husband told me that my father was alive I sent the food to him; I asked Mrs. Doheny what sort of food would be good for them, and she said one cut of bread and butter; I gave it to her.

Witness, to Mr. Wilson—A note was brought to me by my son, telling me to send food to my relatives until their time for appearing would be up; I asked Mrs. Doheny what kind of food I should send, and she told me that at the outset I should not send any drink, and but little food; I sent some frequently by my niece, and a few times by Mrs. Doheny, and anything I sent I gave with my own free will and consent; my father required food; he told me himself that he would come back to me, and I knew he should get something when the Lord God sent him.

Mr. Vowell objected to what he designated a leading question from Mr. Wilson.

Mr. Wilson—I did not lead the witness.

Mr. Vowell—You asked her if Margaret Doheny told her to send the food.

Mr. Wilson—I did not.

Mr. Vowell—You did, sir.

Mr. Wilson—I say I did not.

Mr. Vowell—But I say, and I maintain you did, sir.

Mr. Despard—Mr. Wilson said no such thing, and I think that you, Mr. Vowell, should address the bench in a more respectful manner.

Mr. Vowell—I am not to be taught manners by a person of your description. I won't put up with such gross impertinence.

Mr. Despard—It is you who are grossly impertinent.

Mr. Vowell—It is not because I am a solicitor, and you a magistrate that I am to listen to such observations being addressed to me.

Mr. Hanna, R.M.—If order is not observed I certainly shall leave this place. When you contradict a magistrate you should do it, Mr. Vowell, courteously.

Mr. Vowell—And when a magistrate contradicts me, he also must do it courteously.

Witness, to Mr. Despard—I never got drinks or doses of any kind from the defendant, nor from any one else; she gave herbs to my child, who was foolish; I never gave the woman a shilling for the dead, nor did I ever pay her, nor did she ask payment for attending the child; all the money I ever gave her was one penny; Mrs. Doheny said my sisters and son were too delicate to eat new potatoes and eggs, and I changed the diet next night; some tea was sent back about two weeks ago; I gave fresh tea instead.

James Hayes sworn—I was in the constabulary, and resigned about two months ago; I became embarrassed in town on account of pecuniary difficulties, and the fact came to the knowledge of my officer, to whom some reports were made which grieved me very much; I resigned because I thought I could better pay my debts by working at my trade than if I remained in the force; I know the defendant; I heard of Tom Sheehan, and got a description of him; I was told he was dead; I believe from the description I got of him, that it was he I saw leaning on a wall near Duggan's house; he was pointed out to me by Mrs. Doheny; I did not know William Mullins or William Reeves; according to the description given me of the former by Mrs. Reeves, I saw him or his ghostly appearance; I believe he is dead, and that it was him I saw; I saw him in a field some distance behind this court-house; Reeves and Mrs. Doheny were with me at the time, and I can't say which of them pointed him out; I believe also that I saw Mrs. Reeves' child; it is about fifteen months ago since I first knew Mrs. Doheny; I sometimes gave her small sums in charity, and occasionally some meat and things that would be left after dinner; I never took a penny-worth of medicine in my life from her or any one else, except two pills, and some salts and senna; I gave her a coat and hat for her husband, who is a poor blind man; I very frequently gave charity to other poor people; I never remember that she made me any promises, and I never gave her the money for a special purpose.

Mr. Lalor—Did she promise to do anything for you? I never gave her any money to do anything for me.

Do you believe that you are to get land? I believe nothing till I see it.

Did you not believe that you were to come in for property? I believed it some time ago, but let me explain.

Did any one tell you that you were to get land. [No reply, and question repeated]—I believe Mrs. Doheny did tell me, but I don't undertake to swear it.

Did you ever state to a magistrate that she did? I did on Friday last, but she did not tell me what land I was to get. At one time I heard her say that when those persons of whom Mr. and Mrs. Reeves have spoken would return I was to get some land.

Did you ever give the prisoner more than 6d. in money?—Oh! I did, sir. Mrs. Doheny said the other day that I gave her 2d for a bottle, but I did not. [Witness here read the copy of a letter which was written by Reeves to Captain Power. This copy, the prisoner told him, was required for a person whom he had heard was dead, and whom he understood to be a gentleman named Captain James Power].

Cross-examined by Mr. Vowell—Are you quite clear in your mind now in reference to this matter?—I consider myself that I am.

Was there any haze over your mind when you wrote that letter?—I did not see any, nor did I feel it—(laughter).

You state that you saw William Mullins, a man who has been dead some years; was he alive when you saw him?—I could not say whether he was alive or dead, but my belief is that he was dead—that is he was in his ghostly form—the appearance that men wear after death.

How many ghosts have you ever seen? I never took a note of the number.

Did you see any? I did see one that I considered to be the ghost of a person who had just died—the ghost of a man named Crowley, who was a cousin of my own; it was far away from this; I saw Tom Sheehan's ghostly appearance at between eight and ten o'clock.

Mr. Vowell—That is early for ghosts to be out.

Witness—I don't think it was so; I saw a ghost before at 11 o'clock, p.m.

At this stage of the proceedings the prisoner fell into the arms of one of the Constabulary in a fit, and there was a burst of laughter from the gallery. It was evident that very few in that part of the court believed that she was really sick. The child was taken from the woman's arms, and she was removed outside, where she very quickly recovered and was brought back.

Ellen Walshe, the teacher of a National School, was next called, when the chairman read her informations as follows:—

A. W. H. Heard, complt., Mary Doheny, deft.
Petty Sessions, Carrick-on-Suir.
Co. Tipperary, S.R.

The information of Ellen Walshe, who saith on her oath that a woman who I believe to be Mary Doheny came to my lodgings in Grantown-street, in Carrick-on-Suir, several times, and asked me to write letters for her. I wrote letters often for about the last four months for her; the letters now produced, I wrote for the said Mary Doheny, writing down the words she told me. She asked me to change my handwriting—to write like a man. She paid me 3d for each letter; lately, she paid me 4d, and 2d for the small ones. She refused to tell me who the messages were from or to whom they were going. And the said informant binds herself to attend at Carrick-on-Suir Petty Sessions on the 8th September, 1864, to prosecute Mary Doheny, for said offence, or otherwise to forfeit to the crown the sum of
(Signed)                    Ellen Walsh.

Her supplementary information, sworn on the 6th September, was also read. It was merely identifying the prisoner as the person for whom she wrote the letters now produced in court.

Terence Reeves was next called. He appeared a very intelligent boy, aged between eight and ten years.

Mr. Hanna—Have you learned your catechism?—Yes, sir.

Do you know what an oath is?—No, sir.

Don't you know whether it is right or wrong to take a false oath?—I don't, sir.

Don't you know what would happen to you if you told a lie?—No, sir.

Mr. Lalor—Did any one tell you to say that?—No.

The boy was allowed to retire.

Sub-Constable Reeves—Your worship, the child is only twelve months going to school, and he does not know the nature of his catechism.

A young girl named Doran, the daughter of a respectable shopkeeper, was brought forward to prove that she, too, had written a letter for Mary Doheny. She did not know for whom it was intended, or anything whatsoever about it.

Mr. Vowell, the evidence having been closed, addressed his worship upon the defence, and said he was glad that upon the last scene—so far, at least, as that court was concerned—the curtain had fallen upon as gross a farce as ever was brought before any assembly. In rising to address them, he was baffled to know what language he should address to them; and first, he would ask, what was the charge preferred against the woman in the dock?

Chairman—That of receiving property under false pretences.

Mr. Vowell denied that one single sentence that had fallen from any of the witnesses was calculated to prove that the prisoner was guilty of such a crime. The evidence which had been given merely showed that those persons of their own free will, and not from any misrepresentation on the part of the defendant, had given the food and other articles. Those people had been labouring under the strangest delusions, and was their evidence of such a character as could be relied upon in any court of justice?—assuredly not. He was quite sure their worships would not send such a farcical case before the higher tribunals of the country. After some further observations, Mr. Vowell left the case in the hands of the bench, observing, in conclusion, that he regretted that any little ebullition of feeling should have occurred in the course of the trial, and which arose from some misunderstanding.

Chairman— The bench are unanimous in thinking that this case should be sent to quarter sessions for firther investigation.

The prisoner was removed in custody, and in the course of the evening transferred to Clonmel gaol.

Manchester Times - Saturday 17 September 1864

WITCHORAFT IN TIPPERARY. A case of this description came before the magistrates sitting on Thursday at Carrick-on-Suir. The reputed witch, Mary Doheny, was placed in the dock, and she had an infant, a few months old, in her arms. She is the wife of a blind man, and has been in the neighbourhood about fourteen months. Tho principal witnesses, a constable named Reeves, and his wife said that the prisoner lived with them "almost constantly, eating, drinking, and 'bewitching' Mrs. Reeves, until she has grown, who before had been a fine, handsome looking woman, pale and emaciated, with peculiarly lustrous but sunken eyes." The father of Mrs. Reeves was a man named Mullins, who died some years ago. The "witch," about two months since, brought Reeves and his wife to "an unoccupied house near the railway bridge, and at twelve at night—this they have actually sworn to— showed them the father and child of Mrs. Reeves and another relative, Tom Sheehan, actually alive!" Ever since, with extreme regularity, Reeves and his wife have prepared food and sent their niece with it to Mrs. Doheny, for the use of their relatives and the child who had "come to life." Mrs. Reeves swore her father "died about three years ago, and was buried in Carrick on-Suir: but he is now living in Carrick-on-Suir." When asked how she could say that, she answered, "Because I saw him. I had a whisper from him; his voice was heard by night, and afterwards Mrs. Doheny brought me and showed him to me. She also showed me Tom Sheehan, who was lame, and my own child. They were all alive. I sent them food regularly, and upon one occasion I sent my father my chemise to serve as a shirt for him!" Mrs. Reeves gave her evidience in a clear, collected, and positive manner. Her niece, who took the food to Tom Sheehan, swore positively that she gave the food to him and no one else. Hayes, a retired policeman, came forward, and as positively deposed on oath that he knew some of his own relatives brought to life. Prisoner showed Mullins to him. He believed in ghosts; "for," said he, "I saw one of the county Cork, standing outside the door where a cousin of mine was walking." "It is not so extraordinary," he added, "for persons to be raised from the dead." As the case proceeded the prisoner fainted, or pretended to do so. The people in court seemed to have very little sympathy for her, and many of them are said to have appeared awe-struck.— The magistrates committed her to the quarter sessions on a charge of having obtained money under false pretences.

Glasgow Saturday Post, and Paisley and Renfrewshire Reformer - Saturday 24 September 1864

Reprinted from *The Spectator* of Sept. 17, 1864.

THE TIPPERARY WITCH. There is something much more pleasant and touching about the Irish rustic superstitions than there is about the English. Superstition makes the English boor simply brutal and pitiless, while in the Irish peasant it excites the lively credulous imagination of a child. The belief in fairies or kindly preternatural agencies has wholly vanished from England, while the belief in demons or the black art still lingers to a considerable extent. How different the state of feeling is in Ireland the very curious examination of three or four "bewitched" people before the magistrates of Carrick-on-Suir,Tipperary, Thursday week will sufficiently show. The witch was one Mrs Mary Doheny, the wife of blind man, who appeared at Carrick-on-Suir about fourteen months ago with a reputation for preternatural powers which she soon began to sustain and increase. The charge against her was cheating certain persons afterwards examined in court, and who were evidently far from admitting that they had been cheated all, out of subsidies not in money but in food, on the false pretence that they were for the support of deceased relatives of the contributors recently restored to life—or sufficiently so to need food. The scene in the Court House of Carick-on-Suir was a very curious one. People of all ranks thronged from all sides to hear the examination, and even the most educated persons present were, it is said, in parts of the evidence visibly awestruck and confounded by the siomple faith and earnest testimony of more than one witness to the preternatural facts alleged. The witnesses called against Mrs Doheny certainly testified to the continuous stream of subsidies with which they had supplied her for their rather uncomfortably situated relatives—who appear to have *half* got back from the grave, but still to be, if we may so term it, spiritual invalids living on earth, but in mysterious seclusion amongst the "good people," and preparing on a mild diet of tea and other food generally known to the medical profession as "slops" for their more active return to life; but while they gave this evidence they not only imputed no falsehood to Mrs Doheny, but were even eager in their simple faith that the subsidies had actually been needed and consumed by their half-reanimated kinsmen, whom they had, they said, seen with their own eyes. There is something inexpressibly childlike about the whole story. In reading it we feel as if we were present at the birth of one of those Irish fairy legends related with much spirit by Mr Lover, in which humpbacks sleeping in haunted moats so please the "good people" as not only to get rid of their humps but have them transferred to the persons of their cruel enemies, or banshees flit round decaying mansions wailing forth the deathsong of some one of its inmates. There were no fewer apparently than five independent witnesses who asserted that they had seen the forms of relatives long dead restored life, always it appears in Mrs Doheny's presence, though she does not seem to have claimed any power in the matter. The first witness was "Sub-Constable Joseph Reeves," who stated that after Mrs Doheny's appearance at Carrick-on-Suir some fourteen months ago she began to doctor his child for him with herbs. The child was afflicted with epilepsy, and Mrs Doheny's remedies certainly gained it quieter sleep, he thought, that it had ever had before. But after this little experiment in the healing art, in which she does not appear have been strikingly successful, she seems to have diverted her energies into more exciting channels. We are told that one night at twelve o'clock, while Mrs Doheny's medical attentions were being directed to the child, Mrs Reeves, the wife of the sub-constable, had a vision when she was "in bed, but not asleep," of her deceased father Mr Mullins, who said "he would return home to me in perfection"—whatever that may have meant. Mrs Doheny "had not said anything to me of my father till I told her this circumstance," but the remark appears to have been carefully laid up in Mrs Doheny'a heart, and to have suggested the important change of her "base of operations" from administering physical sedatives to the child to administering spiritual stimulants to the parents. After the hint dropped by Mrs Reeves, that her father would return to her "in perfection," Mrs Doheny appears to have made statements the effect that he *had* returned to life, and would soon manifest himself to his daughter and her family. About four months or more ago "Sub-Constable Joseph Reeves" was asked by Mrs Doheny go with her Knockroe, where he would see his late father-in-law. The man, accompanied by his boy Terence, a child of eight years of age, started, but on getting to Knockroe appears to have seen nothing till Mrs Doheny came up ten minutes after him, when pointing in a particular direction she asked Reeves if he saw anything. I replied, 'Yes,' for I saw father in-Law William Mullins, who had been dead three years, about 20 yards distant from me." Asked by the magistrate whether he was frightened, Reeves replied simply. "I was not, sir; this rare case in a court of justice, and a laughable one to some people, but there have been instances of the kind before." He had known his father-in-law, he said, for 16 years, and "ought" to know him. "We remained looking at him for time; he was standing in the field with a stick in his hand; his side-face was turned towards me. There was good light at the time, about eight o'clock in the evening. I don't think William Mullins is dead now, but he *was* dead. I have been sending him food for the last four months since he came to life. I sent bread, butter, and tea once in each of the twenty-four hours, sometimes by the defendant and sometimes by my wife's niece. Defendant asked in my presence for the food, and as it was after I had seen William Mullins alive, I consented." Reeves further said that he had lost a son named William, who had died at seven years of age in 1860. Two months ago Mrs Doheny told him "to go Duggan's waste-house and I would see him." This he did, again with his son Terence, and he asserts that they both saw his late son William standing inside the window with his dead aunt (Margaret Power) who had died about seven years ago. "They came to the window and I walked up to it, —there was only the glass between us. . . The boy Terence remarked to me when they came to the window, 'There's Will and his aunt.'" We may casually note here the remarkably tenacious memory of the living boy Terence, who is only eight years old. His little brother had died when he was only four years old, and his aunt when he was only *one* year old; but he recognises them at once. The dead or risen boy was said to be in the same clothes in which he died. The magistrate, asking if the lad had had his clothes on when he died, his mother, who was sitting in court, cried out, "Oh, God help us! he had, he had!" and Reeves goes on, "Yes, he died in his chair; he appeared to me to have grown since he died; he did not look very badly, though he was delicate; he had no hat on." Of the aunt he says that she did not wear a crinoline, "they were not in fashion when she died," —but we are not assured whether she died in those clothes or has dressed *since*.There also appears to have been a separate manifestation of some of these deceased persons to Mrs Reeves. Mrs Doheny, she said, brought her father "and showed him me. She also showed me Tom Sheehan (a deceased relative of Reeves), who was lame, and my own child. They were all alive." The niece of Mrs Reeves, who is described as a "fine, intelligent girl," also swore positively that every night, —but "after dark," — she brought tea, milk, butter, bread, and other food, and gave them to her uncle Tom Sheehan, who was always standing under the wall of the old "waste-house." She swore positively that it was to her deceased uncle Tom Sheehan, and no one else, that she delivered the food. A fifth witness was ex-policeman, James Hayes, but as he had known none of the deceased parties in their lifetime except by description, his evidence only proved that he had seen persons whom he believed on his friends' word to be dead people restored to life. These persons still appear to in a very delicate state. The dead father Mullins indeed seems to be hearty, under the protection of the "good people," smokes, and can manage new potatoes and eggs. But "Mrs Doheny said my sisters and son were too delicate to eat new potatoes and eggs, and I changed the diet next night." Some tea was sent back as not good enough for the wards of the fairies, two months ago, and fresh tea of a better quality was substituted. William Mullins wanted clothes but once; and then he made shift with one of his daughter's *chemises* for a shirt. The promise held out by Mrs appears to be that ail these shadowy forms now undergoing their novitiate for a second earthly life in the deserted house near the moat of Ballydine will, after due assimilation respectively of new potatoes, eggs, and bread and milk by the harder men, and superior tea by the boy and women, be able to come back quite to life, and that whenever that occurs, they will "bring their living with them," —an event apparently much to be desired, as the intermediate state is rather expensive to relations who are still enjoying their *first* lease of life, and on whom it is rather hard to ask them to work so hard for relatives who are about to enjoy their second. However, when they *quite* return to life they are to bring not only money but "land in the county of Waterford"—or perhaps rather the *title* to it—with them, which is certainly a consolatory hope; only as the title can only have been gained by a conveyance effected in the other world, it must still be a haraasing doubt to the sub-constable whether earthly lawyers will recognize its validity.—*Spectator.*

[*The full article continues:* Indeed, we fear the wholesome efficay of the Encumbered Estates Act would soon be nutralized if this sort of lien upon land were admitted.

*And then closes with:* The whole story shows a wonderful Irishs *naïveté* and amiability with its marvellous credibility. The placid faith with which the sub-constable and his family accept the intermediate state, and send their tributes of new potatoes, eggs, milk, butter, and tea,to the unreal world, in the sanguine hope of a reversionary right to real property in Waterford in compensation for these pious labours, is quite touching in its simplicity. A whole family give dairy produce to ghosts or fairies and hope for a farm in Waterford as their reward! Was there ever confidence in imaginary powers so profound?]

TO DO

London Evening Standard - Thursday 15 September 1864

Among the peasantry of these islands, in former days, no belief was so common or so grotesque as that in witchcraft. To the imagination of every rustic wench, or village gossip, or frightened child, there was a weird fascination in the picture of night, half gloomy, half lurid, with a hideous figure, in a peaked hat, bestriding a broomstick, far up between the moon and the earth, or a beldame weaving spoils in her hut over a cauldron, seething with such materials aa the hags of Macbeth's blasted heath compounded, or moping over the embers with her owl and black cat, or roaming the woods and fields to smite with the evil eye. There were, too, witches of higher rank, malignant sorceresses, practising the arts of the Wicked One, dealing in wax figures, deadly pins and poisons. Indeed, the varietiee of this fated class were many, many were the victims of the cowardly creed. Poor suspected wretches—not so long ago but that living persons may remember them—were whipped, hunted, mutilated, hanged, burned, gnawed by dogs, and drowned, not by scores or hundreds, but by thousands; and, even in our times an occasional instance crops up in some remote agricultural district of England, or isolated valley of Wales, or Scottish glen, or among the bogs of Ireland. We see it often affirmed that the days of these superstitions have vanished. That, however, is assigning to civilisation too easy a task. If crime and poverty, sloth and filth, grow rank wherever a crowded city rises, ignorance, credulity, stupidity, and brutality linger long, and linger yet wherever the inhabitants, descended from rude forefathers, are left themselves to remain rude, dark, and childish. We have, at present, a most singular example before us of the extraordinary belief in witcheries still prevalent in numerous parts of Ireland. The Tipperary papers are teeming with accounts of the wild excitement raging in that county about a horrible old woman who pretends, by means of ghostly processes, mystic end involuntary, to hold intercourse with the dead. Certainly, no stranger story ever occupied a page, even in the tales of Irish simplicity. Mart Doheny, wife of a blind man at Carrick-on-Suir, is the person implicated, a fearful demonologist who has robbed many individuals, hitherto sane, of their senses, including a policeman. These dreadful arts she has practised during the last fourteen months, calling up in the houses of her friends the forms of the departed—not by Pepper's apparatus, we presume—and she has been—perhaps torn to pieces by the mob?—possibly made to walk over red-hot ploughshares? No, prosecuted by the Crown!—though we trust as a rogue and vagabond rather than in any way which might give an appearance of reality to the popular craze.

TO DO In the house of one Mrs. Reeves she lived, eating, drinking, and bewitching, until the wretched creature lost appetite and complexion, while her huaband lost his senses. Again, one night, at the witching hour when spectres walk in white, she took them both lonely empty house, and showed them three of their dead relatives alive, whereupon the impostor bargained for dally supplies of good food to keep them so—and the simpletons did not see through this fraud wreaked upon their infatuation by lazy and idle thief. Mrs. Reeves, however, eweats that she not only saw her buried father, but heard him more than once whispering In the dark; and, when it was suggested that the old gentleman, thus revisiting the glimpse* of the moon, might want shirt, Mary Doheny recommended her victim to send a woman's chemise, which would more awful —she did not add, to herself. The constable swore deliberately to similar effect. The three dead persona distinctly appeared before him. Their niece deposed, with the same solemnity, that every night she took abundant meal to her grandfather's corpse, at the ruined home, giving it to him and to none else. A second policeman, upon oath, affirmed that also had seen the dead restored to existence. Now, here » comment upon the intellectual progress of our century. What a combination of low craft and imbecile elupidity! Well-dressed penoua, not called as witnesses, affirmed their belief in the witch's hideous work, and the agitation the entire county la almoct alarming. No doubt the black art will be fashionable in Tipperary for a few weeks, and prophetical oatserery where regarded keen-eyed relatives of seen—will be held either in great abomination or in great respect, unless the modem, like some of the middle-age magicians, prefer the form of a ban that they may speed through the night more swiftly. Far and wide, howarer, in Ireland, especially in the loneliest and least populated tracts, this dim belief surTirea—among the villages In the deep glens of the Down in Antrim, in the Braid—and many tale is still listened to with unconcealed awe, of bags and crones burying lire children to keep their hidden trees ores sals; of Idiots cursed with the gift of prophecy; of half-human, half-diabolical creatures becoming risible for moment in the air and then ranishing amid the mountains and lakes. But it is positiraly asserted by the local journals, it was by the magistrates the bench during the extraordinary Investigation at Carrick-on-Suir, that the prisoner had imposed upon many above the lower ranks of society, and that they regarded Uanr Doheny evidently with species of religious dread. The tact must be explained, suppose, by the former universality of this twilight superstition. It is difficult to eradicate the last of creed once accepted by nearly all. Not a few of the Denes still put faith the famous and familiar hag of their mythology, and hundreds of these Pagan ideas wese imported, age after age, into Ireland from the far North. So powerful did their Influence become that legislation has frequently interfered to limit it, and enact prohibitions, with various penalties, Cram death to ducking attached. The circumstance we should witness amazing a spectacle In the yea* 1861 is, therefore, however startling, not Inexplicable. Yet why should we all of us look down superciliously upon the bewitched folk of Carrick-on-Suir and the Braid Do not some of convene with Homer, Shakespeare, and thousand others, '‘the dead and gone." Do we not make oracles of tables and prophets of chairs t Are not the Sibylline books occasionally quoted through the medium of blindfolded boy, who hears and sees about much the brownskinned apprentice of Egyptian quack hears and sees when the palm of his hand is full of inkf Second ngfat, spirit rapping, re'rolying hat*, inUrooor** with the past through mediums??," what reaped they deaorro morn than Lieutenant Mobisom's crystal sphere, gipatea* incantations, the vulgar chiromaneiea o( Epping Forest or the area atepa of London suburb, the oterman's boaat that oan only killed with bullet Our magician* weap dim and jKi'win* £, omi| whorea*; tM fia«ri*S bt former centuriea apparelled himself ao aa to raaemble aolomn pantaloon more than an ordinary mortal, while also making the midnight of his cell hideous with dead fish, cats, bate, crucibles, centers, zodiacal signs, and fantastic furnaces breathing coloured fire.

Be this as it may, revival witchcraft la anticipated in many Irish districts; but we must repeat there is this little more extraordinary than in the delusions which few years ago threatened to spread, furiously and fashionably—not in the Black Country or among the Cumberland ahepherds, but in metropolitan circles, wherein the witch wore the paraphernalia of Bond-street, and SiDBOPHn called his spirits from the vasty deep after tea-time, and before little music."

SUPERSTITION IN 1864

We wonder what success would attend the production of a farce on the stage in which the leading characters should be two policemen and their respective wives, and a witch who succeods in obtaining from the policemen an unlimited supply of money and food, in return for which she exhibits some deceased relatives to the eyes of the astonished constables, who are quite convinced of the identity of the mysterious figures without speaking to or examining them at all? Such a plot, presented to an audience of the very commonest intelligence, would no doubt receive a well-merited condemnation, as something too absurd to be even an ordinary exaggeration of anything which has occured in real life during the past century. Stranger things, however, have been brought to light in real life than what would meet with condemnation if written in a book or acted on a stage; and, in fact, the case which we have hypothetically described above is merely an outline, rather modified, of an which actually occurred a few days ago.

A certain Mrs. Mary Doheny seems to have enjoyed some popularity as a fortune-teller in the towns of Carrick-on-Suir, Clonmel, and Nenagh, and the adjoining districts of Ireland. It is, perhaps, to be scarcely wondered at that a woman dealing with the affairs of the other world should have a large number of adherents in in a remote part of a country amongst the humblest classes. But Mrs. Doheny reached the climax of her fame and fortune when she enlisted among her admirers sub-constables Reeves and Hayes, of the constabulary force, nd their respective spouses. The fact is rendered the more astonishing when we remember that the Irish constabulary are a picked body of men, remarkable for their good education, and more than ordinary intelligence. Mrs. Doheny's first dealings with the worthy constable's family arose from the illness of a child, for the preservation of whose life all her charms were tried, and tried in vain. The child died—but not so the constable's faith in the witch. He is consoled for the loss of his daughter by the assurance of Mrs. Doheny that a certain Sir James Power—some time since dead—has sent from the other world, per Mrs. Doheny, the title-deeds to some landed property which he meant to leave to Sub-constable Reeves. Mrs. Doheny produced, for the satisfaction of Mr. Reeves, letters from Sir J. Power upon the subject, and a correspondence ensued between the living sub-constable and the dead baronet—Mrs. Doheny acting as postmistress—to the extent of some letters on each side! The supposed benevolence of Sir James is rendered still more mysterious by the fact that however willing he might be to give the land, it was exactly that class of property which Sir. James never had it in his power to bestow. This, however, never suggested itself as a difficulty to the sub-constable's mind, and nothing very tangible seems to have resulted from this protracted correspondence. Mrs. Doheny next showed Mr. Reeves and his brother constable the dead father-in-law of the former in a field, one dark evening; and so much faith had Mr. Reeves and his intelligent friends in the honesty of Mrs. Doheny, that they never asked to speak to or examine the ghost, but took her word for it, that it really was his father-in-law. We do not make these statements at all at random. They were sworn to as facts by the two constabulary men in the court of justice where Mrs. Doheny was tried and received the reward of her mis-deeds.

While these performances were being carried on, Mrs. Doheny did not remain unrewarded by the gratified sub-constables. Meat, potatoes, and tea were supplied in abundance to the good woman for the support of her dead friends! it never suggesting itself to the policemen that dead men did not require food, and that therefore this was, to say the least of it, a rather exceptional proceeding. The ghosts were rather particular, and did not seem to have lost their appreciation of good food by their sojourn in another world; and so, when some new potatoes were bestowed upon them by Mrs. Reeves, she received them back from the ghost, who had requested Mrs. Doheny to state that "old ones would be preferred."

Now, if all this were merely a story, it might be very amusing and ridiculous; but when we remember it is real, actual fact, it becomes a very serious and melancholy matter indeed. Nor can we console ourselves with the thought that such occurrences are confined entirely to this one solitary instance. A short time since, at Sible Headingham, the villagers threw a poor old creature into a horsepond, because they believed that she had bewitched some cattle in the neighbourhood. Even in this town and district, we understand, there is a vast amount of superstition, many of the lower classes believing in witches, "white" wizards, signs, and ghosts. We had hoped, indeed, that all this absurdity had passed away with the bygone ages of ignorance; but when humbler folk hear from their superiors —who ought to set a better example—that a table has jumped about a room without human agency, and that some old stool has rapped out a new sonhet by Shakspeare, we cannot be so very much surprised that witches and soothsayers should find some little credence. It is a very lamentable thing that poor people should be robbed of their money and goods by the cunning and intrigue of witches; but surely they can blame nothing for it but their own folly. We have done our duty in calling attention to these wicked practices; and if any one who reads this sees fit to jump with eyes open into the meshes of such a net as the two Irish sub-constables were entangled in, it will be their own fault.

WITCHCRAFT IN IRELAND. (From the Correspondpent of *The Telegraph*.)

I learn from the *Clonmel Chronicle* that Tipperary is in a state of excitement—not, as of old, from agrarian outrage, or the harmless amusement of shooting landlords, their bailiffs and agents, but—would you believe it in this nineteenth century?—in a case of witchcraft. It is, nevertheless, positively true that several apparently sane people at Carrick-on-Suir, among whom is a policeman, have been bereft of their senses by an old woman who professes to be skilled in the ancient science of demonology.

Mrs. Mary Doheny, the wife of a blind man, appeared in that town some 14 months ago, and professed to able to reveal to the living the forms of those long since dead. One of her disciples was a Mrs. Reeves, in whose home she "lived most constantly, eating, and drinking, and 'bewitching' her. until Mrs. Reeves, who before had been a fine handsome-looking woman, grew pale and emaciated, with peculiarly lustrous but sunken eyes." Her husband, Reeves, himself a police-constable, shared in her infatuation. The father of Mrs. Reeves was a man named Mullins, who died some years ago. The "witch" about two months since, brought Reeves and his wife to an "unoccupied house near the railway bridge, and at twelve o'lock at night"—this they have actually sworn to—"showed them the father and child of Mrs. Reeves and another relative, Tom Sheehan, actually alive!" Ever since, with extreme regularity. Reeves and his wife have prepared food and sent their niece with it to Mrs. Doheny. for the use of their relatives and child who had "come to life." The following extract from the sworn informations of these people discloses the most extraordinary infatuation:—

Mr. Hanna, prosecutor for the crown, examined Mrs. Reeves. What is your name:—Mullins is my maiden-name, but Reeves by marriage.

Is your father dead—He died about three years ago, and was buried in Carrick-on-Suir; but he is now living in Carrick-on-Suir.

Living! How can you say that?—Because I saw him.

Under what circumstances:— I had a whisper from him: his voice was heard by night, and afterwards Mrs. Doheny (the prisoner) brought me and showed him to me. She also showed me Tom Sheehan, who was lame, and my own child. They were all alive (sensation in court). I sent them food regularly, and upon one occasion I sent my father my chemise to serve as a shirt for him (This witness gave her evidence in a clear, collected, and positive manner.)

Constable Reeves, a man of about 45 years of age, was next called, and he swore that he, too, saw the two persons and his little daughter whom he believed to be dead. There was no doubt whatever on his mind; there they were where the prisoner pointed them out, and, more than this, she had brought him to a field near the moat of Ballydine, and showed him William Mullins, with whom he had been well acquainted.

The niece was called, a fine intelligent girl she appeared to be, and in a clear voice and unhesitatingly she answered the questions put to her by the magistrates. Having been sworn she said that every night after dark she brought tea, milk, bread-and-bntter, and other food, and gave them to her uncle, Tom Sheehan, whom she always saw standing under the wall of the old house. The magistrates interrogated her closely, but she ihtsisted in swearing that it was to Tom Sheehan and no one else she gave the food.

Hayes, a retired policeman, positively deposed on oath that he knew some of his own relatives brought to light; prisoner showed Mullins to him; he believed in ghosts; "For," said he, "I saw one in the county of Cork, standing outside the door where a cousin of mine was waking." "It is not so extraordinary," he added, "for persons to be raised from the dead."

Singular, is it not, that in this enlightened age, a scene of this description should have occurred in a court of justice? And yet the "supernatural" was not confined to the persons who were produced against this modern Witch of Entlor. "The magistrate," adds *The Clonmel Chronicle*, "and a crowded audience were positively astounded from the remarks which were heard to proceed from several persons— some well dressed, and apparently in comfortable circumstances in life— in life—and also from the awe which was written upon the countenance of a still greater number, it appears that many beside the "bewitched" family believed in the power of the prisoner." From private sources I learn that nothing can exceed the excitement which pervades, I may say, the entire of Tipperary on this subject. The old memories of the past accelerate the infatuation. Witches were considered here, as in the northern nations, to have a peculiar affinity to cats—that sagacious animal being considered capable of seeing into futurity—and hence the skins of cats were worn by witches, and cats and witches were always represented as companions. Witches were also considered frequently to cnange themselves into hares, and thus run with marvellous rapidity on their mischievous errands; and there prevailed a belief among the common people of Ireland—in truth, I often heard it in the cabins of Ulster in my boyhood— that they were invulnerable to leaden bullets, and could be shot only by a sixpence or silver ball. In the same province the belief in witchcraft prevailed to a great extent in former times, and is not yet eradicated; in fact, I heard many tales of it this summer, up in the Braid, in Antrim, and among the Hills of Down, and it is a curious intellectual feature of a certain class of the people there that they will sit evening after evening at the blazing turf and bog oak fire, telling "thrilling tales," of witchcraft. The Evil Eye, called in Irish "Reim-Sul," signifying a "Stroke of the Eye." a belief connected with witchcraft, was in former times very prevalent in Ireland. I was a few years ago told an amusing story, connected with this superstition of the "evil eye," by a distinguished Irish member of parliament, now an equally distingnished judge, who has got a singular optical delusive organ—it recedes and becomes positively not a blank, but an unfathomable opaque, and he facetiously told the superstitious electors of the borough that he had his "evil eye" on them, and laughed heartily afterwards when saying that it served him considerably in his canvass.

Policemen Bewitched, or the Crafty Fortune-teller and the Credulous "Bobbies."—The early portion of the career of Mrs. Mary Doheny, "wise woman," in the towns of Carrlck-on-Suir, Clonmel, and Nenagh is nothing out of the common way. It is only what we may ca'l the natural order of things in a country district that a lady of skilful address, apt at intrigue, and probably a good hand at match-making, should make a comfortable living by selling love-phlltres to despairing swains and maidens. But the doings of tb's woman begin to te interesting from the time she took in hand a couple of members of the constabulary force. These men are, it must be recollected, far above the level of an ordinary English policeman for education and intelligence. They are picked men, and are highly paid according to the rate of remuneration in Ireland. Their occupation would naturally make them—one wonld think—utterly sceptical In reference to a ll fortune-tellers or witches, especially when once these people began to apply themselves to the most direct, constant, and exhausting attacks on their pockets. But sub-constables Reeves and Hayes seem to have resigned themselves like lambs to the process of plunder. One could quite understand that the wife even of a policeconstable might fly to a wise woman for a charm in the deadly illness of her child; and had the daughter of Reeves recovered after Mrs. Doheny's intervention had been invoked, the credulity of the father might have been to some extent explained. But it was after the daughter died that Mrs. Doheny's power over Mr. and Mrs. Reeves seems to have began. The man is misled by no overwrought feelings —by nothing at all, indeed, except by a greedy and avaricioas spirit—when he is induced to believe that a gentleman named Sir James Power, who died some years ago, had, for some inexplicable reason, taken an interest in the officer's affairs, and intended to give him some land. It seems odd that it did not ocour to a police-constable that, however generous might be the Intentions of the deceased baronet, land was about the only thing he could not well give him. He might, perhaps, have disolosed a hidden treasure of jewels or gold; but how he couM manufacture and send from the other world title-deeds to land—and to land, too, whioh at the time belonged to seme one else—ought to bave appeared something out of the range even of a ghost's power. But Reeves took it all in, and was even credulous enough to believe that Sir James Power had written to him through Mrs. Doheny. Through Mrs. Doheny he of course replied, and this strange correspondence was carried on to the extent of some twenty-five letters on each side. There seems to have been httle or no mystery about the manner in which this was done; the woman simply a''eged that some letters which she produced or caused to ba found in a ditoh or on a hill-side were from the dead man, and the living man forthwith believed her and acted upon her statements. But this was not enough for Mrs. Doheny. In order to confirm the power which she had in the first instance gained over these foolish people by means of the story about Sir James Power, she subsequently offered to show Reeves his deceased father-in-law. And no doubt he and his eon did, on a certain evening, in a field previously fixed upon by Mrs. Doheny see some one whom the man believed, and apparently stiM be ieves to have been bis dead relative. Inat be wsb not allowed to address the vision—that it did not address him—tbat he was not allowed to test in any wav earth y or spiritual, Its character—does not seem to have have inspired the faintest suspicion. The idea that he was the victim of a trick, played with the aid of a confederate, never crossed the mind of this astute policeman : when once he had placed faith in the appearance of his fatherin-law, it is not wonderful that he wes subsequently led to believe that he had also seen a sen who died some five or six years a 3 o. If indeed Reeves had stood alone in his credulity the matter might have passed for one of those extraordinaiy hallucinations to which individual minds are subject. But these delusions were shared not only by Mrs. Reeves, but by another constable, named Hayes, and his wife, all??? of whom appeared the otner day 2 "Constables B " o6 solemnly pledged their oaths to the fact that Mrs. Doheny had raised before them their deceased relatives 1 SUM even that does not exhaust the circumstanoes which make this about the most extraordinary ease of superstitious credulity with whioh w 0 ever met. The whole time the swindler was practising her arts, her object was as plain as the sun at noonday.

By such gross artifices Mr. Doheny lived a prosperous life at the expense of these policemen, and no doubt of other clients also. At last, however, the affair got to the ears of jifi Bub - ln8 P eotor of the district, and he determined, if possible, to bring Doheny's career to a close. On proceeding to her house, he found the letters which her dupe Reevea had addressed to Sir James Power.

But it is fact, nevertheless, and the grotesquely absurd cases suggest the queiy whether there really are any limits to superstition or any bounds whatever to credulity. If there are many officers like Reeves and Hayes in the force, it is not surprising we should hear so many complaints from Ireland that it is inefficient in detecting crime.—At the adjourned hearing the magistrates committed the "witch" Doheny for trial on the charge of obtaining money by false prei j tenoes.

Morning Post - Saturday 17 September 1864

The poetry of superstition has not yet departed from Ireland. The fairies have not taken offence at the progress of engineering science, nor has the banshee been banished by the formidable rivalry of the steam-whistle. That pot of gold which everybody knows is buried in the vaults below the ruined abbey is still dreamt of three nights in succession by imaginative peasants; and midnight excavations continue to be made, although the malevolent fates, in the shape of a dwarf or a leprachaun, invariably stand between the treasure and those who seek it. Every glen has its story of the "good people," and every lake is associated with some tale of wonder. Wise men very properly shake their heads, and deplore the fact that the Irish peasantry do not devote themselves to the practical business of life rather than to these exploded follies of the past. A little more knowledge of the power-loom, and a little less faith in cup-tossing, would no doubt be for the advantage of Mistress Erin, but still there is reason to believe science will have to make many a stride ere it drives the last of the fairies from their familiar haunts.

A case has just occurred in Carrick-on-Suir, in the Golden Vale of Tipperary, which, while it illustrates the prevalence of superstition in that part of Ireland, partakes rather of the nature of individual delusion. The fact, however, that the delusion was shared by three grown persons at least, of whom two were old members of the Irish constabulary force, shows that the popular mind on the banks of the picturesque Suir must have been prepared to receive almost any impression, however gross, provided it was associated with the supernatural. Joseph Reeves, it appears, has been a sub-constable in the Irish County Police for a period of twenty-two years. In the town of Carrick-on-Suir, where he was stationed, lived an old woman named Mary Doheny, whose husband is afflicted with loss of sight. The task of supporting him fell upon Mary, and she thought the most profitable business available was that of a witch. It required no capital but cunning, and, as witches are not burned in these days, police-office penalties were not likely to deter her from the pursuit. The sub-constable's child was subject to epileptic fits; and the parents sagely concluded that the fairies had meddled with it. So Mary Doheny was called in some twelve mouths since, and, by a judicious administration of herbs, she caused an improvement in the child's health. Mrs. Doheny, however, was an herbalist rather in the Shaksperian than in any other sense. "Culling of simples," or rather, gulling of simpletons, was her favourite occupation; and, having obtained a certain influence over the minds of the sub-constable and his wife, she proceeded at once to use it to her own advantage. The father of Mrs. Reeves, a man named William Mullins, had been dead and buried more than two years. Mrs. Reeves relates that after his death he appeared to her, and said he would soon return in perfection. This was, of course, narrated to Mrs. Doheny, who was not slow to act upon the hint it afforded. A few days afterwards Mary announced to the sub-constable that his father-in-law had come to life again. This was intelligence which would have startled most men, but Reeves did not presume to doubt it. She told him to meet her at a place called Knockroe. When they met she pointed in a particular direction, and asked him if he saw anything. He answered that he saw William Mullins, his father-in-law, whom he had known for sixteen years, standing within twenty yards of him. He was standing, he said, in the field with a stick in his hand, and his side-face turned towards him. When questioned in court he said he was not frightened, and that he believed the man to be now alive; and he solemnly rebuked those who laughed at him, reminding them that such things had happened before, though he admitted it was certainly a rare case to come before a court of justice.

Fully satisfied that William Mullins had returned to life, it became the duty of Reeves and his wife to supply the old fellow with creature comforts. Accordingly, every twenty-four hours a quantity of provisions was sent by the hands of Mrs. Doheny to regale Mr. Mullins; and as it was known that, when formerly in the flesh, he was rather fond of his pipe, tobacco was not forgotten by his dutiful children. This had been going on for some time, when Mary Doheny announced that tickets of leave had been granted to two other members of the family — one a sister of Mr. Reeves, the other a son, aged seven years, both of whom had long been dead. In the gloom of evening she pointed out the boy and his aunt standing at the window of a ruined house in which they had taken up their temporary abode. The visitors from the other side of the grave of course required refreshment, and additional quantities of food were daily sent by Mrs. Doheny. Now that company had arrived, moreover, it became necessary to look after their wardrobe, and a shirt and pair of stockings were forwarded to old Mullins, in which garments, no doubt, he made a very singular figure in celestial society.

It seems to have been considered by the Reeves's and their friends that all this time Mullins and the other ticket-of-leave people were in a transition state. Mrs. Doheny always held out the prospect of their being shortly able to appear in public, and said that when they came they would bring plenty of gold with them. "I expect to get gold when my people come back," said Reeves in answer to a question; and it was mentioned to Mrs. Reeves, in a note which she had received, as she thought, from the other world, that "they would bring their share when they "came." Of the absolute truth of all that Mary Doheny affirmed no shadow of doubt was ever entertained by her dupes.

But the most singular part of the transaction was that relating to a certain Captain James Power, who had been dead more than ten years. During his life he had known William Mullins; but in death they were doomed to be divided. For Mullins revisited the glimpses of the moon, but Captain Power remained buried in the moat of Ballydine. Still he was fortunately able to communicate, by letter, with his friends on earth; and the fact is worthy of the immediate attention of the Postmaster-General, that a sixpenny stamp served to bring a letter to and from this gentleman, who had been dead upwards of ten years. The rate certainly ought to be increased, for if a shilling be charged for a Transatlantic letter, sixpence must be far too little for the conveyance of a communication from the other side of the Styx. Reeves, at all events, was handed letters by Mary Doheny, which she affirmed she believed were written by Captain Power; and he was even fool enough to send answers back, always taking care to enclose in each a sixpenny stamp. The immediate object of the woman in carrying out this piece of deception did not appear; but, no doubt, her plans had not been perfected when some sensible persons, having heard of her proceedings, caused her to be brought before the bench of Magistrates. Like other clever people, she had overacted her part. The letters of Captain Power had been written for her by persons who have made depositions detailing the facts; but the extraordinary feature of the case is that Reeves and his wife, notwithstanding the exposure of the fraud, continued to place the most implicit credence in all that the woman declared. It is also worthy of note that a second man, named James Hayes, who had been also in the constabulary, waa equally satisfied of the fact that persons whom he knew to be dead had appeared, as if in life, before him, at the command of this modern Witch of Endor.

Had the delusion under which Reeves laboured affected but a single miud, the case would be hardly distinguishable from one of insanity. But several persons, apparently of average intelligence in the ordinary affairs of life, share the delusion, and have been alike victims of the arts of a cunning woman. This fact indicates that there is in the Irish bucolic mind a substructure of superstition which it is the duty of those entrusted with the education of the people to root out. There may indeed be things in heaven and earth too deep for our philosophy; but the cunning devices of an old woman living in a hut on the banks of the Suir ought not to be too much for the intellectual capacity of ordinary policemen. It would be better that the haze of poetry which hangs over an Irish glen or mountain lake were utterly dispelled than that persons, otherwise remarkable for shrewdness and common seuse, should be made the victims of such transparent imposture as that practised by Mary Doheny.

Glasgow Herald - Saturday 17 September 1864

The present age is generally supposed to be prosaic and practical above and beyond all other ages on record. We live in times of railways, steamboats, and telegraphs, and we have gradually come to regard ourselves as a hard-headed, matter-of-fact, and enlightened generation. We are philosophers after our kind, in short; and as a matter of course, therefore, we repudiate superstition, and profess to have no faith in popular illusions or delusions of any character or kind. We are getting wonderfully material in our notions of men and things; and the poetry of life, such as dreams, visions, fables, and romances, are evidently at as great a discount on this side of the sea as "green-backs" and "shin-plasters" are in Federal and Confederate America. We think so, at all events; and are we not a nation of thinkers, either superficial or profound? Are we not perpetually talking of the march of intellect, the spread of education, and the progress of civilisation, as if ignorance and superstition were nonentities in modern society? A very little consideration, however, will show that such ideas of intellectual progress are somewhat extravagant, and that we have not as yet shaken off the bonds of superstition. "Scratch a Russian," it is said, "and a Cossack appears;" and if the hide of any ordinary specimen of the British Lion is pulled off, ten to one we have nothing more than a superstitious ass. As a proof of this, we have only to look around us and mark the signs of the times. Have we not spirit-rappers, and numerous believers in spirit-rapping, among the learned and the great; and thousands, if not tens of thousands, who have an undoubted faith in demonology and witchcraft, among the lower and less educated orders?

Scarcely a week passes over our heads that we do not hear of fortune-tellers and other professors of the supernatural art being sent to prison for deceiving a credulous public, and for obtaining money on the most incredible pretences. Only a few months ago a wretched old man lost his life in the heart of England, because the wife of a publican considered herself bewitched through his cantrips. Her faith in the supernatural, and in the "evil eye" of the old man, was shared by the populace, and the result was a riot, a ducking of the supposed wizard, and ultimately a death. Scotland, in like manner, has her "spae-wives;" and witches too, for that matter, if we are to believe the elders and islanders of Gigha. Our readers cannot have forgotten the remarkable case which came before the Sheriff Court at Campbeltown some time ago, in consequence of a respectable married woman being called a witch and blamed for scouring the country in the likeness of a hare! Last, though not by any means least, we have Irelanld putting in her claims for a due share in the diabolical art, and we cannot do less than admit the fact, and thereby render simple justice to Ireland. The Irish case, in short, is the most extraordinary of the three, and therefore it deserves something more than a passing notice at our hands. The scene is laid in the celebrated county of Tipperary, and the particular locality is the town of Carrick-on-Suir. Here it was, if we may credit the evidence of police-men and other people, that a certain old woman, named Mary Doheny, made her appearance about 14 months ago. She was the wife of an old blind man; she was dressed in a red shawl; and after a time she took up her residence in the cabin of a police-constable named Reeves where she commenced to operate with herbs upon a sickly child, and to bewitch the wife of the Irish policeman. By and by the police constable himself became a firm believer in Mrs. Mary Doheny's supernatural powers, or, in other words, a sharer in his wife's infatuation; and the result, in the first instance, was that the "witch" lived at "heck and manger," eating, drinking, and making herself cosy and comfortable at the expense of this active and intelligent police officer. Now, it so happened that Mrs. Reeves had a son, a father, and some other relatives, who had been dead and buried for several years; and, as a return or compensation for her board and lodging, Mrs. Doheny undertook to restore the said relatives to life once more. How the weird woman set about the business is not stated, but about two months ago she took Mr. and Mrs. Reeves to an unoccupied house in the middle of the night, and there showed them the father, the son, and another relative of Mrs. Reeves, all apparently alive! They were certain of the fact, for they saw and knew the restored persons beyond any manner of doubt, and they have both repeated the story upon oath before the Justice Court of Carrick-on-Suir, and in presence of a large assemblage of awestricken spectators. A son and daughter of Reeves also saw the dead-alive relations at other times, and a retired policeman named Hayes was likewise a privileged and undoubting spectator of this remarkable resurrection.

Besides these revelations, the police constable Reeves was favoured with letters from the other world, written by a Captain Power, who had been in the grave for ten years. These commnuuications, as a matter of course, came through the hands of Mrs. Doheny, and they contained distinct promises that Reeves in a short time would become the owner of money and lands in Waterford. Reeves wrote replies in red ink, and the dead Captain wrote in black; but he (the Captain) omitted to pay the postage of his letters, and stamps were duly furnished by the credulous policeman. As the relations of the Reeves family were thus restored to life by Mrs. Doheny, they felt hungry after their long fast, and required something to eat. They could not return home somehow, and take their meals with the family, but Mrs. Doheny kindly volunteered to carry provisions to them at the empty house. This plan was agreed to, and the dead folks were nightly regaled with bread, butter, eggs, tea, milk, butcher meat, and potatoes, from the larder of Mrs. Reeves. They were not allowed drink at first, but the defunct father of Mrs. Reeves got some tobacco, a pair of stockings, and a chemise, belonging to his daughter, to serve him for a shirt! But although the royived relatives were boarded gratis, some of them were not easily pleased with the bill of fare. On one occasion the tea was returned because it was not fresh, and two of Mrs. Reeves' sisters and her son were too delicate to dine or sup on new potatoes and eggs, according to the story of Mrs. Doheny. This wretched farce went on for several weeks, until it came to the ears of the Crown authorities, when Mrs. Doheny was apprehended on a charge of wilful imposition; and, after a lengthened examination of witnesses, she has been fully committed for trial. Meanwhile, the entire county of Tipperary is said to be in a state of extraordinary excitement in consequence of these proceedings. The people seem smitten with the delusion, and there is no saying how or when the excitement will end. Duriug the preliminary examination last week at Carrick Court House was literally besieged by anxious crowds, and many people of high standing in the county travelled long distances for a simple sight of the "Tipperary Witch." When we reflect upon such matters we may well question our boasted civilisationA and ask ourselves if it is really true that "the school-master is abroad."

Bell's Weekly Messenger - Saturday 17 September 1864

WITCHCRAFT IN IRELAND.

(From the Correspondent of *The Telegraph*.)

I learn from the *Clonmel Chronicle* ... to be skilled the ancient science of demonology.

Before I relate the extraordinary facts which came out on investigation before the magistrates, allow me to remind you that witchcraft is an old institution in Ireland. The Irish borrowed the science from the Scandinavians. The Icelandic Saga gives a singular account of the "Danish hag" called Heida, living in Pagan times, who was famous for her skill in magic, divination and witchcraft—a right royal witch she was, for she went attended in state by thirty men-servants, and she was waited on by fifteen young women; and in the Rauga Saga an account is given of another celebrated witch named Thorbiorga, who, together with her nine sisters, were all professional witches, and famous for their prognostications and knowledge of futurity. THey frequented public assemblies and entertainments when invitod for purposes of divination. Thorkil, Danish earl, in order to know when famine and plague which prevailed would cease, sent for Thorbiorga to tell the time. On her arrival she was dressed in a gown of cloth, closely buttoned from top to bottom; about her neck was a string of glass beads, and her head was covered with the skin of a black lamb, lined with that of a white cat; her shoes were calfskin with the hair on, tied with thongs, and fastened with brass buttons; on her hands were gloves made of the skin of a white cat, with the fur inward; about her waist she wore a Hunlandic girdle, at which hung a bag containing her magical instruments; and she supported herself on a staff ornamented with many knobs of brass. This system of witchcraft so introduced into Ireland by the Danes assumed such proportions, that a special Act of Parliament was found necessary to put it down, and accordingly Queen Elizabeth, who was a "strong-minded woman," and had no nonsense or superstition about her, had an Act parsed (28 Eliz., chap. 2, Irish), which is so curious that perhaps you will excuse me for quoting a rather full abstract of it: "If any shall use, produce, or exercise any invocations or conjurations of evil or wicked spirits, to or for any intent or purpose, or shall use, practise, or exercise any witchcraft, enchantment, charm, or sorcery whereby any person shall happen to be killed," or "death ensue," the offender shall suffer death as a felon, without benefit of clergy; and it was further enacted that if any person so operated upon by witchcraft, &c., should be "wasted consumed, or lamed in their body and members" or "goods destroyed," the offender should suffer a year's imprisonment for the first offence, and once in every quarter of the year stand openly upon the pillory for six hours on a market-day, and openly confess the error or offence; and for the second offence should suffer death as a felon without benefit of clergy. It is a positive fact, which our criminal records attest, that so late as the early part of the last century women were tried in the county Antrim for witchcraft under this Act; and the corporation of Carrickfergus, not to be behindhand, and thinking scolds were a milder species of "witches," "ordered and agreede, that all manner of scolds, which shall be openly detected of scolding, or evil words in manner of scolding, and for the same shall condemned by Mr. Mayor and his brethern, shall be drawn at the stern of a boat in the water, from the end of the Weir round about the Queen's Majesty's Castle in the manner of ducking, and after when a cage shall be made, the party so condemned for a scold shall be therein punished at the discretion of the mayor." The "cage," or "ducking-stool," as it was called—an old relic of Carrickfergus. was, until very lately, existing; and in later times "witches" were mercifully adjudged to be "scolds" there, and subjected to the "ducking-stool" rather than to the severer penalties of the statute of Elizabeth.

The Carrick-on-Suir witchery case is certainly extraordinary. Mrs. Mary Doheny, the wife of a blind man, appeared in that town some 14 months ago, ...

Tipperary Free Press - Tuesday 20 September 1864

WITCHES AND CREDULOUS EDITORS.

That superstition prevails to a lamentable extent in England, and amongst the lower orders in portions of Ireland we do not seek to deny, but while it lingers amongst the educated classes of the former country, wo assert fearlessly that in Ireland it is simply regarded as a thing of the past, that has not now a shadow of existence in similar circles. But for the slander it levels against our country, we could laugh at the unwarrantable statements put forward by the editor of the *Daily Telegraph*, in an article which we find transferred to the columns of our local contemporary, statements completely and in every particular destitute of foundation. What will our Carrick friends say to their mental portraiture as delineated by the Editor of the Journal wo have mentioned. In alluding to the recent trial of the wretched imposter, Mary Doheny, at Carrick Sessions, the Editor remarks:—

"Were these cases exceptionable—were this wretched superstition confined to half-a-dozen uneducated Irishmen and Irishwomen—they would he no more worthy of attention than the recent discovery of couple of crazy old women who believed that they were the only living people in the world. But there is a new interest attached to the story, when we learn the effect which it produced upon the spectators in court, and the extent to which a belief in its truth prevails in Tipperary. Persons apparently belonging to the upper and middle classes of society turned pale as they heard the policeman's statement, and trembled at the power of the reputed witch." Throughout the county, it is said, the greatest excitement exists, Mrs. Mary Doheny, unless her case be taken in hand by some unimaginative and unimpressionable policeman who is less easily hoodwinked than Constable Reeves, bids fair to become a person of no little influence. Already we learn that a frenzy not unlike that excited in Ulster by the wild extravagences of what was called "Revivalism" is spreading in Tipperary."

All this is simply a creation of the writers imagination, or the result of a too implicit belief in the statements of certain people who grasp at every pretence to malign the Irish people. We were present during the trial in question, and are aware of the fact that the testimony of the infatuated witnesses elicited the laughter of one class and the pity of the other. That so far from feeling appalled, and trembling at the "reputed power of the witch." Mr. Wilson, a magistrate on the bench, pronounced the accused to be an abominable wretch, who by her *cunning* had unsettled the intellects of her victims, and we are satisfied that there was not a man in court, rich or poor, educated or illiterate, who did not fully agree with that gentleman. As for the frenzy like to that "excited in Ulster by the wild extravagances of what was called "Revivalism" spreading in Tipperary," that is all moonshine, and too preposterous to need contradiction. The Editor of the *Daily Telegraph* should be better informed before he blindly rushes into print, and publishes to the world such stupid and libellous statements.

The Witch Case— We thought it our duty to contradict the scribblings of some penny-a-liners, who, it appears have made some capital out of the trial of the unfortunate woman named Mary Doheny, on charge of taking money, &c., under false pretences. The character, or rather that which she had assumed, was not more stupidly false than the colouring some writers have been induced to give the proceeding. The woman in question was a stranger in Carrick-on-Suir, having only been resident the for about twelve months, and the people Carrick strongly repudiate the slur sought to cast upon their intelligence by the scribblers in question.

"Witchcraft" in Belgium.—  At Bergen-op Zoom, an old woman who had been for some time compelled to give her occupation of sick nurse because she was reputed to be a witch, was a few days ago suddenly attacked by a boisterous mob, who dragged her into a house where there was sick child. She was then accused of having bewitched the child, and was threatened to be burned alive if she did not immediately restore the child to health. Explanations and remonstrances on her part were unavailing, and a large fire was kindled, when those who were present were about to put their threat into execution, and would have done if the arrival of the police had not prevented them. Those who were implicated in this scandalous outrage have not yet been punished for their attack on this aged and defenceless woman.

MRS. DOHENY OF CARRICK. In reference to the necromancy case of Carrick-on-Suir, recently reported, and the strictures passed upon "Ireland's superstition" by certain of the press leaders of public feeling in England, it is right to inform the ignorant that during the entire course of the imposition but two families were its dupes, consisting of the immediate connections of two members of the Constabulary force, Reeves and Hayes, both of whom, with their connections have been but recently sent to Carrick-on-Suir. The simple but powerful truth in this imposture is, that the native residents of Carrick are wholly blameless, and they feel greatly and naturally indignant at being held up by prejudiced writers to the ridicule justly deserved by persons allowing themselves he made the dupes of such a sham. Before those censors of public morals indulged in their strictures, it would be well they adopted, in practice, the safe rule, "Seek for the Truth."

The popular naming of the story was also to change, with Mary Doheny's coming to be known as "the Carrick Witch", with a growing reputation alongisde what we might take to be her new trading name...

THE CARRICK WITCH.

"Tho' absent, ever dear," is the motto of the faithful Carrick people in regard to Mrs. Doheny, the witch. While she remains in durance vile at Clonmel, her influence appears to have increased at home. Some whose position and circumstances ought to give hope for better, are firm believers in her powers, and positively assert that at each midnight she revisits the scenes of her fame, the bolts, bars and padlocks of the gaol notwithstanding. Others, well-to do and somewhat intelligent people, who would fain laugh at superstition, have not courage to deny the "fairy woman," who needed only to skim with her charmed bowl St. Nicholas's well (Carrick), and so take all the butler belonging to him who was the object of her wrath. "Then," said our informant, "you might church till your hands would cling to the staff, and nothing would come but butter milk!" The supplying of food to the dead men still goes on, the niece of Reeves going regularly with her basket at nightfall to where the resurrectionists assemble, and it is curious that although many times watched by policemen and town watchmen, as also by others, neither the dead men, nor their impersonators can be seen, and yet the basket is always delivered. —*Clonmel Chronicle.*

Catholic Telegraph - Saturday 24 September 1864

THE ENGLISH PRESS IRISH WITCHES AND WITCHERY. The other day the press of all Cockaeydom with the small fry of the provinces followins; suit, was loud in its denunciations of the Papal Government because it refused to permit an itinerant spiritualist named Home to practise bis diablerie in the Eternal City. Bnt, recently when some three or lour weak-minded individuals were deluded by the impostures of the woman Djheny, the same consistent members of the British Fourth Estate were equally clamorous and inexhaustible on the vast amount of superstition, unenlightenment, and ignorance prevalent amongst the Romanists Ireland. Now, have no hesitation in asserting without the slightest fear of contradiction, that Carrick-on Suir, the place in which the peripatetic Mrs. Uoheny temporarily practised her charlatanism, contains far greater proportion of wellinstructed, well-informed, sod enlightened inhabitants than any town of its extent in model England. Nay, we venture to say that taking equal number of the deniztns of the Great Babylon of Britain, there will be found considerably larger portion of them on whom Mrs. Doheny or any other oi her craft would exercise her delusive ait more successfully than she could on the shrewd and quick-witted Romanists on the banks of the Suir. Nor we well see how it could possibly be otherwise. Living on the high road of communication between the principal cities and towns of the South of Ireland, possessing all the advantages which excellent schools, a zealous and highly educated clergy, tolerable trade, and frequent intercourse with the metropolis and the people of the most populous places in the country, the inhabitants of Carriek-on-Suir, considering its comparatively small extent, is far less liable to be witchridden than those mysterious quartiert of the British metropolis in which such seers and sages as Zadkiel, Home, and others of the Dobeny genus hold their brilliant levees of Right Rev. Fathers in God, Dukes and Dowagers, Princes and Peers, to say nothing of the humble gatherings round the fortune-telling bag on the high-ways or the gipsy Pythoness in the by-ways and places of the rural districts. The *Morning Post* ensconces itself in its dogmatic chair, and in the course of its homily on poetry, superstition, fairies, and leprechauns, lectures the Irish after the following grave fashion:—

Wise men very properly shake their heads, and deplore the fact that the Irish peasantry do not devote themselves to the practical business of life rather than to these exploded follies of the past. A little more knowledge of the power-loon *`[sic]`*, and a little less faith in cup-tossing would no doubt be for the advantage of Mistress Erin."
  
We may incidentally remark, in regard to the latter portion of the preceding paragraph, that, as in everything else calculated to prove beneficial to Ireland, England has done all she could to deprive her of any advantage she might derive from the profit which a knowledge of the power-loom might otherwise have afforded her. But as regarde the knowledge itself, it so happens that there is no town of its size in Ireland that has more seduloualy applied itself to industrial occupations—another reason why it cannot be charged with leaning to superstitious practices or a belief in the ridiculous mummeries and gross impostures of so palpable an empyric as the woman Doheny. It turns out, moreover, that all the parties that figure in the affair are comparatively strangers in the locality, not having resided in it more than a year or two. This latter fact adverted to in our editorial observations last week, and we think it due to the high characters which the inhabitants of Carrick-on-Suir have always enjoyed for intelligence as well for their progress with the spirit and enlightenment of the age, to remove any erroneous impression that may have been made regarding them by the various comments which have appeared on the absurd delusions which happened by mere chance to be practised by a raving impostor in their town, but for which its inhabitants are wholly unaccountable. It would be well if the English journalists were to apply their strictures more frequently and earnestly to the numberless cares of profound and stolid ignorance manifested by the masses, but also a very considerable number of the middle classes of their countrymen. Take, for instance, the recent case of Louis Gough, who, at the ripe age of sixty-two, aa the *Times* itself stated, "ignorant of the commonest forms of religion up to the time of his conviction for the barbarous murder of a woman with whom he had lived for years." But this hoary-headed sinner is only one of a number whose name is legion. The Court of Justice in England furnish instances daily of adult and juvenile criminals, whose profound ignorance on every ordinary subject, sacred and profane, has been one of the principle causes of their entering upon and pursuing till the close of their guilty career, a life of sin, crime, and depravity.

Tipperary Free Press - Friday 14 October 1864

WITCHCRAFT— We learn from Limerick, that a wierd sister of Mrs. Doheny the "Carrick witch" at present residing in our county gaol, has also come to grief in that locality. The case came on for heanng at the last Casticeonnell petty sessions, avd attracted a great deal of interest. A large number of magistrates attended, including the following: R. G. Gibbett, Eyre Lloyd, C. Powell, Helenus White, George Sampson, and E.G Bell, R.M. Esqrs. A woman named O'Grady, *alias* Sheridan *alias* Hogan, with an nfant in her arms, was brought up in custody on a charge of having obtained money under false pretences. From the evidence of several witnesses it would that the prisoner, who is a stranger, lately made her appearance in Castleconnell and immediately commenced her work of imposture on the credulons people of that locality. She first introduced herself to a Mr O'Brien, publican, into whose house she had gone for a drink, and represented to him that she was an agent between this and the spiritual world, and could foretell things to come. After some conversation with her, Mr O'Brien was induced to give her 13d, 1s of which she wrapped ina piece of paper, and pretended to cast into the fire as a votive offering to the inhabitants of the other world, through whom she feigned to derive her divine knowledge. It is unnecessary to say what she did with the shilling. When preliminaries had been accomplished she told him there were a great many enemies near him, and that she would be able to rid him of those unpleasant monsters. After succeeding in duping Mr. O'Brien out of another shilling and some whiskey she went on to give a history of his future prospects in life. The spirits she had taken appeared to have little or no relation with the dubious phantoms of the phantoms of the same name somewhere else, for instead of affording her assistance to complete her swindle, they completely deprived her of of her senses and consequently of her powers of whitchraft. Mr. O'Brien began to suspect her, and ultimately gave her into custody. It afterwards transpired that she had been successful on two occasions previously in vicitimising others in a similar manner. She went to the house of a pensioner named John Fanning and asked to be permitted to boil some water. This request was conceded to her, and in the meantime she became interested for the safety of Fanning. He was on the eve of a serious fit of illness, and she had means of obviating it. Fenning `[sic]` was much obliged for her forewarning, and tendered her some money, she in return pretended to sew within the lining of his trousers a piece of herb which was brought from Jerusalem and which he did not attempt to open lest the charm would lose its influence. For these and other acts of imposition the prisoner was brought before the court. The magistrates said the cases were clearly proved but as the money had been given to her voluntariy, they would not inflict that severe sentence which the aggravated nature of the offence deserved. She should be imprisoned for one month with hard labour.
