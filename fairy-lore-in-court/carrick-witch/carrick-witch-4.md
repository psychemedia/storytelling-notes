The child was admitted and a warrant issued for the apprehension of the mother.

GRIEVOUS ASSAULT — TEETH KNOCKED OUT.

A pensioner in the 19th Hussars named William O'Donnell, was charged with assaulting woman named Mary Doheny in New-street the 1st inst.

O'Donnell was also charged with assaulting a young girl named Margaret St. John, in the same house and on same occasion.

The defendant pleaded not guilty, and was defended by Mr. O'Donohoe.

The complainant in the previous case is the noborions Carrick witch, whose mediumistic manifestations with the spirit world, some four years ago on behalf of a police constable, who wished to hold communication with his deceased friends, were as wonderful and remarkable as those of the renowned Home.

Complainant deposed that on the night in question she was out picking water cresses and on her return to her home she found the defendant with a boy, named Lar O'Donnell drinking some beer which they had sent out for, at the fire. At about 10 o'clock when the beer was drank she said to O'Donnell that there was no person stopping in the house but two lone women and that he should get up and go to his lodgings. He then took hold of the girl St. John, and commenced taking improper liberties with her when she witness interfered he hit her with his fist and knocked out one of her teeth and loosened two more. Witness exhibited the gap occasioned in the front of her mouth by the loss of her tooth, and in further corroboration produced the displaced tooth rolled up in a piece paper. The two adjoining ones were quite loose and ready to fall out at any moment.

The witness was humourously examined by Mr. O'Donohue with reference to her commnnications with the spirit world and the Ballydine post-office at the Rath from which place she represented to the duped police constable that all her communications concerning his deceased friends were forwarded.

Complainant's husband a blind man who occupied a seat in the gallery loudly protested against the bench for allowing his consort to be badgered in such a manner about a by-gone transaction, and had to be removed from court.

Margaret St. John, on being sworn, stated O'Donnell, on the night in question attempted to take improper liberties with her, and on previous witness interfering he struck her in the mouth and knocked out one of her teeth. He then caught her by the hair of the head and struck her several times.

The defendant pleaded guilty to this assault.

For the offence he was sentenced pay £2 and 2s costs, or in default three months' imprisonment with hard labor. For the second assault he was sentenced 5s and costs or one week's imprisonment.

Gough, Alderman Kenny (Mayor), and Henry Moore, a policeman named Muldowney, Lisronagh station, was charged by Mary Doheny, the notorious Carrick witch, with assaulting her.

The case was dismissed.

And then a few years later on, she would also appear as a witness in another case of violence:

By 1875, Mary Doheny has taken on a role of child-carer, but the parents, it seems, have absconded.

Another case out of the ordinary groove was an application to have a child admitted to the house, and which was brought forward under the following circumstances:— Some few months ago the parents—a respectable, well-to-do farmer and his wife—left for England, and when leaving they handed over this child to the care of a woman named Mary Doheny, known as "the Carrick Witch," who has of late years, with her blind husband, taken up her abode in this town. She regularly paid for minding her little charge, but now that the woman had become sick, and could not mind the child, she sought to have the little one admitted to the workhouse.

Mr. O'Halloran said that he knew the father to be a most respectable farmer, and if the application were granted he was sure that they could recover, and would be paid for, the child's support.

Alderman Crean—Under the circumstances we must admit the child, but we will have a claim against the parents. —Agreed to.

A woman named Doheney applied to have a young child, which had been left her by Daniel Landy and Johanna Cleary, both of whom were now in England, admitted to the house. She stated she was to get a certain salary for rearing the child, and that she had no idea that the father and mother would desert it and leave her in charge of it.

Mr. Fitzgerald—Are you the Carrick witch?

Applicant— One of them, sir (laughter).

Mr. Fitagerald— If you are a witch, tell us where the father and mother are.

Applicant— I only know they are gone to England. I knew well, when coming here to-day, I would be humbugged and laughed at.

The child was subsequently admitted.

The last we hear of Mary Doheny, she is back on a charge herself, her reputation as "the Carrick Witch" still going before her.
