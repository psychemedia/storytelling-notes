# Aftermath

With Mary in gaol, and her family's source of income, even if not of the pecuniary kind, seriously curtailed, and her blind husband perhaps unable to look after their child himself, it seems that the child had been homed in the Colnmel Poor Union Poor House.

Alderman Hackett—Is he the husband of the celebrated witch?

Master— He is, sir.

Mr. Gordon— The father of the child is blind and the mother is in gaol.

But Mary Doheny's story does not quite end there, for we continue to find traces of her, typically identifed as the *Carrick Witch*, in several press reports over the following ten years or more.

From the first direcly report we have of her since her being sentenced to a year's imprisonment with hard labour, we learn that she must have been admitted to the Clonmel Poor House, for in July 1866, she is seeking to be discharged from there.

THE CARRICK WITCH.

Among the several persons who applied to be discharged with the view of getting employment, was the celebrated Mary Doheny, the Carrick witch, whose feats of necromancy, and pretended communication with the spirits of the dead, some two years ago, at Carrick, set some local folk by the ears, and afforded "original matter" for gullible penny a linearism.

The pseudo witch, on applying for permission to take her discharge, betrayed evident symptoms of uneasineness as some of the guardians began to put questions to her as to her previous residence, antecedents &c., and the suggestive word "Carrick," with its world of associations of the verdant and gullible, was stated by Mary as the last residence she occupied previous to her two years change of airin the Gaol.

She stated to the board that her husband, a blind man, earned his living by selling papers in Clonmel, and it will be remembered that the blind husband, in the days of Mary's acknowledged sway, not only over the living, but also over the dead, played an important part in the nefarious plot, so widely and successfully developed by the Carrick witch, by sitting in a waste house, dressed in sheet and shroud, and representing the ghost of some departed persons, whose anxious relatives were answered as many questions as they choose to put to the blind ghost, about the fate of their deceased friends and relatives. Food, money, and other material comforts usually required by the inhabitants of this "earth of ours" were said by the sheeted and shrouded blind ghost, to be as much needed in the "land of the leal," and forthwith, money, eggs, tea, and other creature comforts, which were supplied in abundance in a dressed state, had to be presented in a raw and unprepared state  at the fairy rath at Ballydine, as deceased got tired of this state of things, and wished, like ordinary mortals, for a change of diet, said change being much a better business in Mary's line than the prepared matters in the bills of gastromony. It is needless to say that the celebrated Mary Doheny was allowed to take her discharge.

The guardians, after transacting soma minor routine business adjourned.

Her reputation, or notoriety, as "the Carrick witch" seems hard for her to escape.

The Carrick Witch.—— Mary Doheny, the Carrick witch, having undergone her term of imprisonment for her necromancy, in Clonmel gaol, then took refuge in the poorhouse of that town, and on Thursday last she applied to the board to be discharged, to seek employment. She stated to the board that her husband, a blind man, earned his living by selling paper in Clonmel, and it will be remembered that the blind husband, in the days of Mary's acknowledged sway, not only over the living, but also over the dead, playing an important part in the nefarious plot, so widely and successfully developed by the Carrick witch, by sitting in a waste house, dressed in sheet and shroud, and representing the ghost of some departed persons, whose anxious relatives were answered as many questions as they choose to put to the blind ghost, about their deceased friends and relatives, in return for which the "blind ghost" was supplied by the gulled with money, eggs, tea, clothes, &c., which he represented to the credulous were needed by the "revived spirits."

On being discharged, she appears to have taken on work as a child minder. But when the mother apparently absconds, leaving Mary unpaid and unable to afford to look after the child, she returns to the Clonmel Union seeking admittance for the child into the poor house.

Tipperary Free Press - Friday 09 July 1869

GRIEVOUS ASSAULT — TEETH KNOCKED OUT.

A pensioner in the 19th Hussars named William O'Donnell, was charged with assaulting woman named Mary Doheny in New-street the 1st inst.

O'Donnell was also charged with assaulting a young girl named Margaret St. John, in the same house and on same occasion.

The defendant pleaded not guilty, and was defended by Mr. O'Donohoe.

The complainant in the previous case is the noborions Carrick witch, whose mediumistic manifestations with the spirit world, some four years ago on behalf of a police constable, who wished to hold communication with his deceased friends, were as wonderful and remarkable as those of the renowned Home.

Complainant deposed that on the night in question she was out picking water cresses and on her return to her home she found the defendant with a boy, named Lar O'Donnell drinking some beer which they had sent out for, at the fire. At about 10 o'clock when the beer was drank she said to O'Donnell that there was no person stopping in the house but two lone women and that he should get up and go to his lodgings. He then took hold of the girl St. John, and commenced taking improper liberties with her when she witness interfered he hit her with his fist and knocked out one of her teeth and loosened two more. Witness exhibited the gap occasioned in the front of her mouth by the loss of her tooth, and in further corroboration produced the displaced tooth rolled up in a piece paper. The two adjoining ones were quite loose and ready to fall out at any moment.

The witness was humourously examined by Mr. O'Donohue with reference to her commnnications with the spirit world and the Ballydine post-office at the Rath from which place she represented to the duped police constable that all her communications concerning his deceased friends were forwarded.

Complainant's husband a blind man who occupied a seat in the gallery loudly protested against the bench for allowing his consort to be badgered in such a manner about a by-gone transaction, and had to be removed from court.

Margaret St. John, on being sworn, stated O'Donnell, on the night in question attempted to take improper liberties with her, and on previous witness interfering he struck her in the mouth and knocked out one of her teeth. He then caught her by the hair of the head and struck her several times.

The defendant pleaded guilty to this assault.

For the offence he was sentenced pay £2 and 2s costs, or in default three months' imprisonment with hard labor. For the second assault he was sentenced 5s and costs or one week's imprisonment.
```

Notwithstanding that the accused was clearly guilty of assaulting Mary, knocking out three of her teeth, as well as breaking a considerable amount of her crockery, the defendant's solicitor sought to ridicule Mary as much as he could for her previous activities.

Clonmel Chronicle - Saturday 10 July 1869

Mary Doheny (*alias* the Witch) v. Wm. O'Donnell. The complainant is the Carrick celebrity, who a few years since was sentenced to 12 months' imprisonment by the late Sergeant Howley for keeping the "dead letter" post-office at the Moat of Ballydine.

Alderman Kenny—Mary, are you post-mistress yet? (laughter)

Complainant—Sure, yer honor, I gave my twelve months for that, and your Reverence wasn't a bad friend to me while I was in gaol.

Mary, on being sworn, said—I am a poor industrious woman, with a blind husband, and I earn my living by gathering watercresses; I have a little room in which I keep decent lodgers, and when I came home the other night, the defendant and another pensioner were drinking porter in my room; the other man I knew, and he said defendant was a friend of mine, but I did not know him; the other man went away, and at 11 o'clock I told this fellow to go to his lodgings, when he took off his coat, tucked up the sleeves of his shirt, and deliberately sat down on the stool; there was a young woman in the room, named Peggy St. John, to whom he used bad words, and I insisted on his going out, when he gave me a blow with his clenched fist, knocked out three of my front teeth [one of which witness handed up to the bench], and after beating me into a mummy he broke and smashed all my little cups, saucers, plates, and bowls, and then dragged Peggy around the room, by the hair. [Witness here produced a bag which contained the *debris* of her china-ware, which, on exhibiting to the court, she properly described as being smashed into *smithereens*].

Cross-examined by Mr. O'Donohoe:—I drank none of the beer; I wouldn't drink with you if you acted *on* decent (laughter); I lived honestly in Carrick; to be sure I got 12 months from Sergeant Howley for bringing letters from the dead to a policeman, but didn't I suffer for that? I was called "the witch," but what of that? I could tell you something about yourself, Mr. O'Donnell (laughter).

Alderman Kenny—Mary, that is Mr. O'Donohoe (laughter).

Witness—May be so, yer honor; but he has great talk, whoever he is. To be sure I gave defendant the door when I saw his badness, and when I did give him the door, faith he gave me his benediction (laughter). I know where the Moat of Ballydine is well, and I think I saw you there one night (laughter); I don't keep a post-office there; I don't know where the poor policeman now is, that his dead relations wrote to (laughter).

Margaret St. John, on being sworn, fully corroborated the evidence of complainant.

Alderman Kenny (to prisoner)—Are you a pensioner?

Prisoner—Yes, sir; I have 10d. per day, for two years, from the 19th Hussars.

Mayor—The bench is of opinion that this offence is clearly proved, and the sentence of the court is, that you be imprisoned, with hard labour, for three months, in default of payment of a penalty of £2 10s. and costs,—one-third of the penalty to be paid to the complainant.

The same defendant, in addition to the above sentence, was fined five shillings and costs, or one week's imprisonment, for an unprovoked assault upon Margaret St. John. The plaintiff complained to the court of the mode of cross-examination adopted towards her by the solicitor for defendant.

Mayor—That gentleman only acted according to his instructions, and merely did his duty; but you leave this court without the slightest imputation on your character.

The other magistrates concurred in the observations of his Worship.
```

On complaining about his behaviour, the response was essentially "no harm done" and Mary was told there was no stain on her character arising from his words.

But the public ridicule was to continue, to such an extent that the following year, Mary brought a charge against a policement who had been taunting her and encouraging others to do the same. The case was dismissed.

The case was dismissed.

Another case out of the ordinary groove was an application to have a child admitted to the house, and which was brought forward under the following circumstances:— Some few months ago the parents—a respectable, well-to-do farmer and his wife—left for England, and when leaving they handed over this child to the care of a woman named Mary Doheny, known as "the Carrick Witch," who has of late years, with her blind husband, taken up her abode in this town. She regularly paid for minding her little charge, but now that the woman had become sick, and could not mind the child, she sought to have the little one admitted to the workhouse.

Mr. O'Halloran said that he knew the father to be a most respectable farmer, and if the application were granted he was sure that they could recover, and would be paid for, the child's support.

Alderman Crean—Under the circumstances we must admit the child, but we will have a claim against the parents. —Agreed to.

Mr. Fitzgerald—Are you the Carrick witch?

Applicant— One of them, sir (laughter).

Mr. Fitagerald— If you are a witch, tell us where the father and mother are.

Applicant— I only know they are gone to England. I knew well, when coming here to-day, I would be humbugged and laughed at.

The child was subsequently admitted.
