MARY DOHENY,

THE TIPPERARY WITCH

Good people all I pray draw near,  
The truth to you I'm going to mention  
Some wonders I will let you hear,  
If you but only pay attention;  
Hobgoblins, ghosts and leprachauns,  
Those later days become the theory,  
And imposition on us powers,  
In the shape of a witch from Tipperary.  

CHORUS:-  
So ladies take my advice & be as wise as any  fairy,  
Or you'll be enchanted in a trice by the magical witch of Tipperary.

In Carrick-on-Suir the other day,  
Or near a churchyard convenient rather,  
She led a policeman so much astray,  
She made him believe a jack ass his father  
When the ass did bray sure he did pray,  
To be taken away to old Dunleary,  
The way that he no more could see,  
The ghosts of his friends in Tipperary

Soon after that near to Clonmel,  
An old maid that was nearly doating,  
Went off to try if her magic spell,  
Could get her the beau that she was courting  
Though she hadn't a sound tooth in her head,  
For a man she felt some way contrary,  
But the Witch delivered her purse instead,  
Of getting her married in Tipperary.

Then next morning as the day did dawn  
The Witch to Fethard she cut gutter,  
To a farmer that they call Shaun Baun,  
And told him she'd double his milk and batter  
He gave her a pound which was no joke,  
And she told him to enlarge his dairy,  
But she vanished next day like a blast of smoke  
With the price of his butter from Tipperary

But after all her magic spells,  
Poor Mary she was nabbed quite handy  
And locked up in the Clonmel cells,  
Where she'll get skilly instead of brandy  
Twelve months for to exert her skill,  
They gave unto this precious deary,  
To learn her how to tread the mill,  
For they're wide awake in Tipperary,

```
