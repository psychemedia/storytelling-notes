*The Carrick Witch.*— Mary Doheny, the old lady who set "Carrick and the country" in a blaze by her "witchcraft," was convicted at Clonmel quarter sessions on Wednesday, and sentenced to twelve months' imprisonment.

For the *Clare Journal and Ennis Advertiser*, the evidence as presented to the QUarter Session was substantially the same as had appeared before, and only the verdict, and Mary's response to it, merited much comment.

THE CARRICK WITCH CASE.

At the Clonmel Quarter Sessions, some days since, Mary Doheny was charged with fraudulently obtaining goods from Joseph and Mary Reeves, at Carrick-en-Suir, on the 1st June, 1864.

Evidence was given similar to that published at the police investigation, when

Mr Vowell addressed the jury for the defence, and contended that the witnesses must have been out of their senses, and that their evidence was not to be relied on.

Mr Serjeant Howley addressed the jury, who, after few moments' deliberation, handed in a verdict of "Guilty."

Court— You could not return more proper verdict. The party sitting on the chair, and those seen in the house and in the field, were, I am told, persons instructcd by the prisoner, and she had impressed her victims with the belief that they were their relatives.— One was shown in the dusk of tho evening; another was seen at night. Since the trial took place I have been speanking to Mr. Heard, S. I., and he informs me that the prisoner's husband, and a man who led him about, were the parties who personated those characters, and the imaginations of her dupes were so wrought that the imposture succeeded.

Prisoner— Oh! my lord, think of my poor blind man, and my two poor children.

Court—You are a terrible woman and a impostor. You must confined in jail for 12 months and kept to hard labour.
```

The trial itself was widely reported in the British, as well as Irish, press.

TRIAL OF THE CARRICK WITCH. A woman, named Mary Doheny, known as "the Carrick Witch," has been tried at the Clonmel Quarter Sessions for fraudulently obtaining goods from Joseph and Mary Reeves, at Carrick-on-Suir, on the 1st of June, 1864. Mary Beeves deposed that the prisoner had attempted to cure one of her children with herbs boiled in new milk, and continued attending the house for the purpose nearly every day during ten months. She said she used to see her dead father and other dead members of the witness's family in the Moate at Ballydine; and, as a proof, prisoner said that witness was to get a note from them, which Captain James Power was to write for them. Witness's child was sent for the note, and several letters were received purporting to come from the deceased relatives. The prisoner next said she wanted bread, butter, and tea for the people in the Moate, and these were daily supplied during four months. Witness also fancied that she saw her own deceased father. He was sitting in a chair opposite the door, quite near her, having on a blue a coat, knee breeches, and a hat. He said three times he was going, and that he would return with plenty; and the prisoner said he was going with "the gentry," but would return. The prisoner often asked the witness for wine and spirits. Since her arrest there was no appearance from the other world. The husband of this woman, Joseph Reeves, a sub-constable, now stationed at Kilmainham, near Dublin, was as great a dupe as his wife. He deposed that he saw and knew his father-in law, who was only 20 yards from him. He believed that the man had come to life, and thought he had a ghostly appearance. He never saw a dead man standing before. He saw his son also in an empty house where he was brought by the prisoner. He, too, had a ghostly appearance, and had not the shape of a living person, and the prisoner stated that it would take a considerable time for him to come to perfection. The jury found the prisoner "Guilty." Mr. Serjeant Howley, who presided on the Bench, stated that he had been informed by Mr. Beard, sub-inspector of constabulary, that the dead persons had been personated by the prisoner's blind husband, and a man who led them about. One of the apparitions was at dark, and the other in the night. The prisoner then cried, "Oh, my Lord, think of my poor blind man and my poor children!" The Court: You are a terrible woman and a dangerous impostor. You must be confined in gaol for twelve months, and kept to hard labour.

CRIMINAL BUSINESS — Wednesday

Mr Sergeant entered the Crown Conrt shortly after ten o'clock, when the following gentlemen wore sworn on the GRAND JURY.

His Lordship, addressing the grand jury, said— Gentlemen, the cases on the calendar to come before yon are very few, and there is no case of any particular significance connected with the peace of the county. The cases are of an ordinary nature, and you cannot have any difficulty in investigating the charges set forth in the different indictments. However, there is one case to come before you of rather an unusual character, in some respects, but in others, perhaps, not very extraordinary. That is the case of person charged with obtaining property under false pretences, and it would appear, from looking over the depositions, that the facts are follows:— The person charged represented that she was possessed of some extraordinary powers of communing with the spiritual world, and it seems that she went to a member of the police force, and to his wife, and stated to the man that she had seen his father and father-in-law, who were dead for some years; that they were now in the land of the living; and, with these pretences, gentlemen, she perfectly "possessed" this policeman, who is still in the force, and exercised a like influence over his wife also. The policeman appears to have been a person of good character —a steady, sober man —performing hia duty properly, with nothing about him to show that, upon any other, save in regard to the representations, of this woman, suffered any delusion of mind. At all events, her statements had such effect upon the man and his wife that they thoroughly believed what she told them, nnd were positive that the persons she asserted she called upon from the world of spirits were the parties she indicated—namely, the man's father and father-in-law. Upon these representations the woman obtained food and various other things for the use and benefit, as she alleged, of those who were now, according to her statements, capable of making use of material comforts of life. She got food and other matters under the pretence that she would take them to the father and father-in-law of Joseph Reeves, the policeman. Now, gentlemen, it does not affect the case, or justify the prisoner, that the policeman or his wife were perfectly satisfied that the persons whom she showed them were their relatives, long deceased; and, gentlemen, the law with regard to false pretences is that a man is indictable where he states, as an existing fact, what he knows to be false, and gets money or other property upon such representations. But no future promise will constitute a false pretence. Let me explain. Suppose the woman said, "give me some money or some food, and I'll bring it to your father-in-law," it does not declare any fact. But if she says, your father-in-law is living," though long since dead, then that would be the declaration of a fact that was false; and if, upon this representation, she solicited food for the deceased, then this would amount to a false pictence, provided that the woman herself was fully under the impression that what she stated was false. If, on the contrary, the woman was labouring nnder a false impression some such hallucination as that which seems to have possessed Reeves and his wife—if she believed that the dead had really come to life—then no indictment for false pretence could at law be established against her. With these general observations I will leave the case to you for investigation. You will see in the indictment that it is stated she said that Reeves' father and father-in-law are living, and she got food for them. If these facts are proved and that you believe that she knew stated what was false, you will be justified in finding true bill against her.

THE CARRICK WITCH.

Mary Doheny was charged with fraudulently obtaining goods from Joseph and Mary Reeves at Carrick-on-Suir on the 1st of June, 1864.

Mary Reeves sworn and examined by Mr. Bolton —I am the wife of Joseph Reeves, subconstable; he was stationed in Carrick-on-Suir on the 1st of June; my father's name was William Mullins; he was dead three years last May; I had three sisters, two of whom I knew to be dead, one over ten years and the other about seven years; I had a child, William, who died four years ago; I know the prisoner Mary Doheny; I had a conversation with her about my dead relatives in last June; I know her for more than twelve months; I first spoke to her about curing one of my children who gets weaknesses; she gave the child some herbs boiled on new milk several times; she commenced attending the child about ten months ago, and continued so for more than a month; she continued coming to my house after that nearly every day; I was one night after quenching the light in my house when I saw my father; it was before the month of May; had been speaking to the prisoner about my father before this; she drew down the conversation; she said she used to see my father and all the family in the moate at Ballydine; she told me so more than once; she told me afterwards that they were coming home from Ballydine moate; had told her before this that they were all dead; I said I'd hardly believe her, and she said I would get a note from them (suppressed laughter in court) ; she desired to have my child go to the moate at Ballydine, and that Captain James Power would write the note for my people; he is also dead, but she said he was in the moate; sent the child for the letter; Mary Doheny went with him; they came back together; the child had the note, and he gave it to me; the child told me he got the note from a man who dropped it to him in a field; got a great number of letters on the same day from Captain James and others; they were brought either by my child or the prisoner; the prisoner told me about the 5th of May to send some bread and butter, as my sister and sou had come home to this world to live here; they were coming one by one, as she said, and I increased the supply; the last came home the fair day of Glin; she told me to send the food for them to eat it; I gave her bread, butter, and tea, and she said she delivered it to them; was giving them to her for four months once every evening; some eggs were sent; she returned them, saying they did not agree with my child, who was coming home; would not have given her those things but that I thought she was giving them to my people; believed her at that time; she subsequently took the letters from me, but they were got with her by Mr Heard, S.I.

Cross-examined Mr. Vowell— I was examined in this case at Carrick-on-Suir; remember what I swore then; Mary Doheny lived near me and was in the habit of coming to my place; the first time I spoke to her was when she came to care my child; my child is foolish; she gets weaknesses and walks in her sleep; she said first that she would cure my child to perfection.

Court— There is no charge against the prisoner for not curing the child.

Mr Vowell— I only examine her to test her accuracy, my lord.

To Mr. Vowell—The child remained in bed at night for about a month after she gave her the first dose, but she did no good otherwise; I said in conversation to her that my father was dead; she told me after that my father and sisters had come home, and that he was in a house in Carrick, and that I should support him there until they were relieved out of Duggan's store; I saw my father one night at twelve o'clock; about two months after she told me he had come home; I was glad to hear people were coming back; I believed at the time he was coming; I once went to the gate leading to the store from which she said I would see them; it was on a Sunday; I did not see them; I did not there after; I was in bed about three quarters of an hour when I saw my father; I did see him; he was sitting on a chair in the kitchen, opposite the door; he was quite near me; my husband was in bed but was asleep; I did not speak to my father, nor did he to me; he spoke to me after that night between eleven and twelve; I know he was not alive when I saw him first; he had a blue coat, knee breeches, and hat on; he also had a stick in his hand; his voice came to the next door, and I heard him saying he was going three times, but that he would return.

At Mr Vowell'a request, Mr Dorney read the informations sworn to by witness at Carrick, in which it was alleged that her father spoke to her two nights before appeared to her.

To Mr Vowell—My father said three times that he was going but that he would return with plenty; I did not believe he was alive then, for she said he was going with the gentry; I heard a child's voice outside the door another night which I believed was my child's voice; I said in Carrick that I gave the things of own free-will, but when I did thought they were for my family; what I did not swear in Carrick I now say, that the prisoner often asked me for wine and spirits; I did not see or hear from my father since the prisoner was arrested.

To the Court—She asked me first to send them bread and butter, and I afterwards sent them freely.

Sub constable Joseph Reeves sworn.

Mr. Bolton said he would not examine him. He would only produce additional witnesses for crossexamination.

Examination Mr Vowell— I am a long time in the force; I was removed from Carrick to Clonmel, and am now stationed at Kilmanahan; I remember when the prisoner came to my house to cure my child; she said first that she would cure her, but afterwards that she could not do so entirely; I knew my fatherin-law well; he is dead over four years. I saw man about eight months ago at Knockroe which I believed was my father-in-law. He was about twenty yards from me. It was in the dusk of the evening. He had a black coat and trousers on him. I believed that he was dead at the time, but he came to life after. He seemed to have a ghostly appenrance. I never saw a dead man standing before (laughter.) He was leaning on a stick. I only saw him once. The prisoner told me after that he would come home and I believed he came to life. I had a son William. I know Duggan's store. I saw my son in an unoccupied house belonging to Duggan. The prisoner told me to go there and that I would see her. I went quite close to the window and I saw my son near it, inside; I was looking at him for five minutes. I saw him in a ghostly appearance inside. He was not in the shape of a living person, but the prisoner told me it would take a considerable time before they would come to perfection. I believed he was alive. I never saw Captain Power dead or alive or on horseback. I was present on about a dozen occasions when the food was sent. I heard Mrs Doheny ask for the food on the first occasion. I never told you when leaving the court-house in Carrick that the prisoner never asked for the food.

Mr Vowell, addressing the jury for the defence, said —Gentlemen of the jury—I am sure you will agree with me when I say this is as novel a case as was ever tried by twelve living men (laughter)—it certhinly is as curious a one as ever came within my knowledge.— This woman is charged with fraudulently obtaining food, but I don't think that you will say by your verdict that you believe the evidence of the two parties who have sworn to you that when they supplied the provisions they firmly believed that Mullins and the others mentioned were in the land of the living. If you believe that you must bring in a verdict of insanity against Reeves' wife, that both must have been out of their senses at that particular period— if you can't believe them in that regard, what becomes of their evidence to-day?— how can you give credence to it ?—the woman contradicts what she swore to on the 1st June; she then said it was of her own free will she sent the food; to-day she has changed her tactics and swear* that it was at the solicitations of the prisoner; you will I am sure be of opinion, that at the time those people were labouring under some hallucination, and that if would not be safe or just for you to consign my client to gaol upon such evidence; it is unnecessary that I should detain you further, but I must direct your attention to one point, it has not been proved that those people were dead, they may be in the land of the living and—

Mr. Bolton—Oh, it has been distinctly proved.

Mr. Vowell— The witnesses said so, but that is no proof, however, gentlemen, leave the case in your hands, satisfied that you will pronounce a just and impartial verdict.

His Lordship addressed the jury and said—Gentlemen, the case is a short one. Much matter has been introduced into it which could have nothing to do with the issue you have to try. All about the illness of the child, and the treatment to which she was subjected is extraneous and unnecessary evidence except that it may tend to show the manner in which the alleged fraud was brought about. The woman is charged with representing to Mrs. Reeves that persons long since dead were in progress to life again, at one time partially alive with the good people, and that they were "coming home" for the purpose of fraudulently obtaining food from her. He said if you believe the evidence that they were in a house in Carrick-on-Suir, and that they should be supported there until they became perfect in their bodies. If you believe she made those statements well knowing them to be false, and having succeeded in making an impression on Mrs. Reeeves, and that she induced her to give the food under the superstition that her relatives were living, and that they required sustenance that would amount to getting the food under false pretences. With the credulity of those people you have nothing to do; they appear to have been very credulous, and I believe that many persons of a condition in life much above theirs have faith in similar matters; but if believe that acting on the woman's statement and her requisition that Mrs. Reeves thought her relatives wanted food and gave it accordingly, that amounts to a state of facta which support the indictment, or if knowing they were not dead the prisoner got this food, and used it to herself, that would maintain the case. If in the first instance she told Mrs. Reeves that hee father was alive, and if without more said Mrs. Reeves gave her the food that would not amount to false pretences, there should be a request made for it. These are the facts of the case, gentlemen, and if you believe the evidence, gentlemen, it will be your duty to find the prisoner Guilty.

After few moments' deliberation, the jury handed in a verdict of guilty.

Court— You could not return a more proper verdict. The party sitting on the chair, and those seen in the house and in the field, were, I am told, persons instructed by the prisoner, and she had impressed her victims in the belief that they were their relatives. One was shown in the dusk of the evening; another was seen at night. Since the trial took place I have been speaking to Mr. Heard, S.I., and he informs me that the prisoner's husband, and a man who led him about, were the parties who personated those characters, and their imaginations were so wrought up that the imposture succeeded.

Prisoner—Oh, think of my poor blind man and two poor children.

Court— You are a terrible woman and a dangerous impostor, yon must confined in gaol for twelve months, and kept to hard labour.

There being no other cases to be disposed of, the court adjourned.

Clonmel Chronicle - Saturday 22 October 1864

CARRICK-ON-SUIR WITCHCRAFT CASE

Mary Doheney was called to plead to the following indictment:—"That she, on 1st June, 1864, at Carrick-on-Suir, in the county Tipperary, unlawfully, knowingly, and designedly, did falsely pretend to one Mary Reeves that Wm. Mullins, the father of the said Mary Reeves—a child of the said Mary Reeves, and three sisters of the said Mary Reeves— and which said Wm. Mullins, Wm. Reeves, and said three sisters of the said Mary Reeves, were all long previously dead— were all in life again in human form, and had from time to time appeared to and was seen by the said Mary Doheny, and that they ate and consumed food, by means of which false pretences said Mary Doheny did then unlawfully obtain from the said Mary Reeves certain goods and chattels—to wit, bread, tea, a nightdress, and one pair of stockings, with intent thereby to defraud; whereas, in truth and in fact, the said Wm. Mullins, Wm. Reeves, and said three sisters of said Mary Reeves were all then dead, and were not, nor were any one of them alive. Nor did they, the said Wm. Mullins, Wm. Reeves, and the said three sisters of the said Mary Reeves, nor either nor any of them, from time to time, nor at any time at all, appear or were seen by the said Mary Doheny; to the evil example of all others— in like case, offending against the form of the statute in such cases made and provided, and against the peace of our lady the Queen, her crown and dignity."

In a loud voice she pleaded "Not Guilty." A second indictment, equally length, was read, and to this also the same plea was made.

The prisoner was then given in charge.

Mary Reeves examined by Mr. Bolton — I am the wife of Sub-Constable Joseph Reeves; he was stationed at Carrick-on-Suir; my father's name was Wm. Mullins; he is dead three years last May; I had three sisters, who died; I did not hear of the third dying, but I heard of two of them dying; one of them is dead about ten years, and the other one six years; I had a child that died; his name was William Reeves; he is dead four years; I know the prisoner, Mary Doheny; had conversations with her about my father, sisters, and child.

Did she make any statement about these persons? She did.

Did you know her before? I did, over 12 months. At first she had a conversation with me about one of my children who is delicate. She came to cure her.

Did she give her anything? She did, sir; she gave her some herbs boiled on new milk. She gave the child these things several times; it is about ten or eleven months since she first attended my child; she was attending the child over a month; after that she gave over the child, but continued coming to my place; I was not in the barracks with my husband; she came every day to my house, and was coming for some months.

How did you come to talk about the father? I was one night in my house before May, and shortly after quenching the light, I saw my father.

Had you any conversation with the prisoner about your father before that night? I had.

How long before that night? I could not tell.

Who drew down the conversation? She commenced it. I had more than one conversation with her; she told me she used to see my father; she told me so in my my own house.

Did she tell you when and where you had seen him? Yes, she stated she had seen all my family in the moate at Ballydine. She told me that more than once.

Did she say anything more at that time? She did not for a while after.

What did she tell you? She told me that they were coming home.

From where? From Ballydine moate.

Had you told her anything about whether they were alive or dead? I told her that they were dead, and she knew from me that they were. I told her then, my lord, that I would hardly believe her, and she said I would get a note from them (laughter in court).

Did she tell you how you would get the letter? She did, sir; she told me that my child would get it.

From whom? From Captain Power, who was to write for them.

Is Captain Power dead? He is, sir, and she told me that he would write for my family; that he was in the moate of Ballydine (laughter).

Did you send your child for the letter? I did, sir.

Did any one go with him? The prisoner did. They returned, and the child handed me a note in the prisoner's presence.

Did the child tell you where he got it, in the presence of the prisoner? He did. He said that a man dropped it in a field.

Did you get many letters? I did, in the same way from Captain Power, who wrote for my dead relatives. Some were conveyed by the prisoner and others by the child; when by the latter, the prisoner was generally in his company.

Was there anything said by the prisoner about sending them eatables? There was. About the fifth of May the first bit was sent to them. She told me to send them some food, that my sister and son were come home to this earth.

That they came back to this world? Yes, sir. That they were coming to live here again. They were then coming home, one by one, until she said all had come back. There was about a week from the time the first of my family came home until the last came. When they were all at home, I commenced to send bread.

Why did you send them bread? She told me.

For what purpose? For to eat it. I gave her bread and butter and tea, which she told me she delivered to my family.

Did you give her those things more than once? I was giving them to her every night for four months. The prisoner always told me she was giving it to my family. There were some eggs sent.

Did the prisoner say anything about the eggs? She returned them once, saying that my child that had died, but had come home, had turned against them. I would not have given those things to the prisoner but that I thought she was delivering them to my people.

Did you believe her statement that your people were alive? I did at that time, and that was the reason I gave her food.

Did you give the letters you got to Mr. Heard? I got them from Mrs. Doheny and my son, but she took them back again, and they were found with her.

To Mr. Vowell—I was examined on this subject at Carrick-on-Suir; I recollect what I swore on that occasion; I know Mary Doheny twelve months before this.

What was the reason she came so often to your house? To cure my child. She came to tell me that she would cure my child, who was foolish and took weaknesses six or seven times a day.

Did she not tell you that she would only keep her quiet at night, but could not do anything else? She did not; she said that she would cure her as well as myself.

Did she do any good to the child? She did not, but she kept her quiet for a month in bed, after whatever she gave her.

Is not that doing her good? Yes.

Why did she not continue it? My husband said she had done the child some good, but I did not; I used to say in conversation with her, that my father was dead; she told me, after that, that my father was in a house in Carrick, but had to remain a length of time there before coming home, and that I should support him there.

Court—Where was your father to come home to? To me.

Mr. Vowell—Did she tell you what house they were in? She did, sir.

What house? In Mr. Duggan's store; that store is a waste one.

You say you saw your father one night about twelve o'clock? Yes, sir.

How long before you saw him did the prisoner say he was in that house of Duggan's? About two months.

I suppose you were very glad to hear that your poor father was coming back? Well, I was, sir.

Did you believe at that time that he was coming back? I did at that time, while I was getting the letters.

Did you go to see them and welcome them home? She told me I would see them through the windows, and I went one Sunday, but I could not see them.

Well you swear they were not in the store? I will not; but if they were there I would see them.

Were you in bed when you saw your father? I was, about three quarters of an hour.

Did you see him? I did.

Where was he? Sitting on a chair in the kitchen from me; he was sitting down opposite the door, quite near me; my husband was in bed at the time; he was not awake.

Did you welcome your father back? I spoke nothing to him, nor he to me that time.

Did he speak at all that night? He did not, but he spoke to me after that night, between eleven and twelve o'clock.

How long did he remain in the chair? He disappeared at once.

Was he dead or alive? I could not say.

Had you any doubt but that it was your father? I believe it was. He was dressed in a blue body-coat and knee-breeches, with a stick in his had and his hat on. After that he came to the door and spoke to me, and said that he would come three times and go away; I did not see him after that.

The informations of the witness were here read. They stated that it was previous to seeing her father that she spoke to him. The depositions we have already published.

Now, as you say *after* instead of before, seeing your father, that he spoke to you, what did he say? He said he was going three times, but would return again.

Did you believe your father was alive when you saw him? I did not. He told me that he was going with the gentry; I also heard my child's voice after; the previous night she told me that they would be there.

Did you not swear at Carrick that anything you gave was freely given, and that Mrs. Doheny did not ask for it? I freely gave it after she told me that my people wanted it, and—what I did not swear at all to—she often asked me for meat and wine.

Upon your oath, did you not say that whatever you gave to Mrs. Doheny you gave her freely, and she did not ask you? I did, and often asked her if they (witness's dead relatives) would like those things, when I would be giving her bread and butter, and she would answer that she thought they would.

Did you not swear that Mrs. Doheny did not ask you for these things? I always gave them freely when she told me she was bringing them to her family; she often asked me for bread and butter before May.

Did you say at Carrick that you believed your father was alive? I did.

And how do you know that he is not alive now?—Because I did not hear from him since; if I did, I would believe he was alive.

To the Court—Prisoner asked me for bread and butter for my dead son, that he was come home, and I gave those things freely.

This concluded the witness's examination, and Mr. Bolton, S.C.S., said he would not examine the other witnesses, but would call them to be questioned by Mr. Vowell.

Sub-Constable Reeves examined by Mr. Yovell—I am still in the police force, and am stationed at Kilmanahan; I recollect the time prisoner attended my child; I knew her some time before; the child is unwell still; she used to get out of bed every night; Deheny gave her some herbs.

What effect did the herbs produce? They had the effect, for a short time, of making the child sleep quietly, and she did not go "romancing" about as she used. Mrs. Deheny said she would cure her at the commencement, and after about two months she said she could not cure her effectually.

Did you know your father-in-law? I did for about three years before I was married.

How long is he dead? I believe something about four years.

Did you see your father-in-law since he died? I saw a man whom I thought was my father-in-law.

Did you see a man whom you were perfectly sure was your father-in-law? I did. I saw him about seven months ago in a place called Knockroe; I saw him in a field convenient to a ditch about twenty yards from me. He wore a black coat and trousers and a hat. It was dusk at the time; the man was standing.

Did you believe your father-in-law was dead; now, answer properly? If you let me, I will answer everything; I have no desire to have Mrs. Doheny punished. When I saw the man in the field at Knockroe I did not believe he was alive, but I afterwards did.

Did you believe he was dead? I did.

And he was standing in a field? Yes; he appeared to me in his ghostly appearance.

Did you ever see a dead man standing in a field looking at you? I did not until that occasion; the man I saw was stooped, and had a stick in his hand; I did not see him after that.

Did you believe that they were alive subsequently? I did, on the prisoner's statement. I had a son named William (now dead); I know Duggan's store; I saw my son through a window standing in a waste house belonging to the store.

Court—Why did you go there? Prisoner told me to do so, and that I would see my son.

Mr. Yovell—Did you go close to the window? I did, quite close, and saw him within a yard of the window.

Did you remain long looking at him? I did, about five minutes.

Was he dead or alive? He was dead, but the prisoner told me he was after returning to this world. I said at Carrick that I believed him to be alive. He was not in shape or appearance the same as a living person. I saw him in his ghostly appearance, and, according to the prisoner's statement, it would be a considerable time before he would come to perfection.

Was it not from the evidence of your own senses, looking at your son through the window, that you believed him to be alive?—No.

Have you any senses? I have.

Did you not state at Carrick that you believed your son to be alive? I did, but he had not his proper appearance.

Did you ever see the poor captain—Captain Power? Never, to my knowledge, dead or alive, or on horseback, as the saying is.

Now, about the bread and butter given to Doheny.—Upon you oath, were they not the free offering of your wife, and not at the solicitation of Mrs. Deheny? Well, I don't know.

Did you ever hear Mrs. Deheny ask for those things? I did in the beginning.

Did you not state at Carrick that they were the free offering of your wife, and that Mrs. Deheny never asked for them? I did not state that she never asked for food.

Mr. Yovell then addressed the jury for the defence. He said—Gentlemen, this case is the most extraordinary one that, I believe, has ever been brought before a court of justice, to be tried by twelve sensible and, I hope, living men (laughter). You are called on to state whether the unfortunate woman in the dock received from Mrs. Reeves this property—viz., bread, butter, tea, and clothing—under false pretences; and I don't think you will be prepared, upon your oaths, to say by your verdict that you believe the evidence of Reeves and his wife, who swore to you that they believed that Mullins and their child were in the land of the living. If you believe that, you must find a verdict against Reeves and his wife of insanity—that they must be mad and out of their senses at the time they saw Mullins and their child. If you do not believe that they saw their dead relatives alive, then how can you believe the remainder of the evidence; and I may say the wife's evidence is very different from that given by her at Carrick. What becomes of the evidence of her when she says that on many occasions she sent food to those whom she knew were dead some years, but whom she thought then alive. Can you, gentlemen, believe the evidence of such idiotic people, who believed the dead to be alive, and capable of using food. You will not, I am sure, gentlemen, do any such thing, but you will scout the idea of sending the unfortunate prisoner to gaol for, perhaps, a long period, upon such testimony. But, by-the-bye, the crown has not proved that Mullins and the others were dead, for I take it that the evidence of Reeves and his wife goes for nothing. I now leave the case in your hands, certain that your verdict will prove that you have same opinion as the public at large have on this matter.

His Lordship, in addressing the jury, said that the charge against the prisoner was of a very simple nature—viz., that, upon representing to Mrs. Reeves that persons long since dead were in progress of life, and capable of using food, she got, on this false representation, tea, bread, &c. If the jury believed that the prisoner did make use of those statements, well knowing them to be false, and upon such representations obtained food, &c., from Mrs. Reeves, then the indictment was sustained. The credulity of Reeves and his wife had nothing whatever to do with the matter.

The jury found the prisoner GUILTY.

His Lordship said that it struck him at once that in all the places mentioned by the witnesses as where they saw their dead relatives, there must have been real people, dressed in a peculiar way, put there by the prisoner for her own purposes. He had just been informed by Mr. Heard, S.I., that her husband acted on those occasions. However, it was a clever piece of imposture.

Prisoner–Oh, think of my blind man and three children. Mr. Gough, I throw myself in your hands, sir.

Court——this, I find, prisoner, is not your first offense. You are a clever woman–a most clever impostor.

Prisoner– Oh––

Court– You must go to gaol for twelve months, and be kept to hard labour.
```

As well as reporting on the court proceedings, the *Clonmel Chronicle* sought to identify what might have given Mary Doheny the idea to perpetrate such a fraud, suggesting it might well have been a case she would have heard when acting as a witness in another case, at Dungarvan, several years before.

Clonmel Chronicle - Saturday 22 October 1864

THE CARRICK-ON-SUIR WITCHCRAFT CASE.

This case, tried at our Quarter Sessions, naturally excited considerable interest, and a crowded court leaned as it were anxiously forward, to catch a glimpse of the woman whose influence had wrought a spell over a police constable of thirty years' standing, over his entire family, and several other persons besides. When she was put forward in the dock Molly Doheny — for this was the very unromantic name which the Sybil possessed — bowed to the learned sergeant and to their worships — and dawdling an infant in her arms, she stood most unconcernedly while the Deputy Clerk of the Peace, Mr. Thomas Derney, was reading through the voluminous indictments, which covered several sheets of parchment, and bristled with as many counts as a porcupine has quills! Those indictments indeed ingeniously prepared to meet the legal difficulties which at first presented themselves to the able Sessional Crown Solicitor for this county, owing to the rather imperfect nature of the evidence; and even as it was, there seemed, up to the very evening preceding the trial, but little chance of the crown succeeding against the prisoner; while it was feared that a clever, and a heartless imposter, would be acquitted of the charge preferred against ber, and that she would be once more let loose unpunished upon society, to play her pranks, and trade upon the ridiculous credulity, of not only policemen and their wives, but also upon the dairy women of the country, from whom she has coaxed many a five pound note to bring back milk to their cows when dry. Sub-Constable Reeves and his wife have been brought very much to their senses. The hallucination has worn off; it has been chased away in some measure through the ingenuity of the police officer, Mr Heard, who made the woman send the food, as heretofore, to her deceased relatives. When Mrs. Reeves found that the "shadowy hand" was no longer pushed out from the supposed resting place of embodied spirits— namely, from the hole in the wall at Duggan's old store — when she saw the bread, butter, and tea, brought back unconsumed, the poor woman very naturally began to think that Mary Doheny's imprisonment in gaol had something to do with the return of the food. A glimmering of light broke in upon the bewitched family, and while in this frame of mind the sub-inspector found little difficulty in procuring such conclusive evidence of the prisoner having solicited and obtained money under false pretences, as to lay the foundation of a second case against her at a future time should the present indictment break down. Mrs. Reeves, on Tuesday evening last, freely confessed that "the witch" asked her three times for *eleven* pence—a larger or a smaller sum would break the charm—to be used in providing a certain medicine necessary for the purpose of raising her friends from the dead. Having then implicit faith in the power of the sorceress she gave the money. Here was an unquestionable offence against the law, but the report of the case as tried before the court on Wednesday last, and which report will be found in another column, will show that there was sufficient testimony already to convict the prisoner, and she was convicted, and sentenced to twelve months' imprisonment and hard labour.

WITCHCRAFT IN DUNGARVAN.

We think we have found the source from Mary Doheny, "the Carrick Witch," derived her inspiration. About ten years ago she was present in court at the Dungarvan Quarter Sessions, when a notorious character, who had bewitched several ignorant country people, was brought to trial on charge of false pretence, and robbery from the dwelling where she had been entertained. The history of this case and its belongings is strange—nay, absolutely ludicrous—and it may not be out of place to refer to its leading features. There lived near Abbeyside an humble man named Crow, half-fisherman, half farmer, several members of whose family had emigrated. His cottage was about three miles distant from one of those old castles which speak eloquently, though silently, of the feudal past. One evening while the fisherman was applying himself to ply is arduous calling, a strolling beggar woman, accompanied by her little daughter, tapped at his cottage door, and was admitted by his wife. She made herself at home, and, by her frequent reference to the woman's relatives, the vagrant rapidly gained upon the affections of Crow's wife. The mysterious visitor then began to speak of the "good people" — the fairies—and into the ear of her over credulous listener she poured the most extravagant stories as to the boundless wealth to which *she* knew Crow's relatives were heirs! The fisherman returned, and his wife introduced to him this strange woman who had told her all about their distant people, and the poor man received, as eagerly as his widfe had done, the tales of the splendid fortunes which lay in store for them. The accurate description of his absent relatives by the wandering gipsey gained for her most extravagant stories implicit confidence, and for several weeks the woman and her daughter were fed on the daintiest food until poor Crow found himself very much a loser. As the stranger promised to make him one day, and that very soon, a wealthy man, Crow willingly plunged himself and his family still more deeply into debt. At length the time came for him to be raised from comparative poverty to enormous wealth, and Crow was enriched after the following manner!— We have already stated that an old castle stood not very remote from the old man's cottage. It was the fabled repository of long-hidden treasures; and, though many people had sought in vain to disinter the gold which was secreted there, as tradition stated, it remained for the poor fisherman of Dungarvan bay to break the spell, and discver the wealth buried 'neath the crumbling ruin! Norry, "the fairy doctor," acting as the enchantress. The plan of operation was that, before the witching hour of night, Crow and his son and herself were to proceed to the old castle, the young man carrying a new travelling bag; they were to utter not a word on the way, and, having gained their destination, the two men were to dig in a certain spot she would point out. It was a dark and dismal night when they left on their strange journey, and in breathless silence they reached the old castle, where Norry began jumbling her mysterious incantations, gesticulating violently. In the darkest corner of the ruin she pointed out the spot where the gold was to be dug for, and there they set to work, and toiled on with only the light of a farthing candle, until they got about six feet down, when Norry beckoned them to stop immediately, and retire outside the castle. They obeyed her, and while they were absent she lifted into the travelling bag — for which poor Crow had paid four shillings and sixpence at Mr. Orr's hardware establishment in Dungarvan — a large lump of "goold?" She closed the bag, locked it, and flung away the key. The Crow's were then bidden inside, and, with strict caution that the bag should not be opened until the young man brought it to Dublin, she commissioned him to forthwith proceed to that city to convert the treasure into sovereigns at the Bank. The poor dupe had to beg and borrow in order to raise the price of the fare to the metropolis; and at last he scraped sufficient together, went to Dublin, and waited upon the governor or chief cashier. The story seems incredible, but it has all formed a chapter of real life, and stands recorded in the annals of the quarter sessions for the county of Waterford! The young man entered the office (if we are to believe his own letter, produced in court), and whispered to the bank official that he had a lump of gold, which he wished to convert into cash.The gentleman thus addressed looked at the boy, and, suspecting it was some treasuretrove, asked him to produce the bullion. Crow carefully closed the door and cut open the bag; when, lo! there was a great lump of a stone!! The imagimnation must paint the scene!—The manager naturally thought he was in the presence of a madman, and sent for the police;—a warrant was obtained, and we believe Crow was conveyed to a lunatic asylum, to repent his folly at his leisure. The story was noised abroad, and it reached the ears of a medical gentleman, a resident of Dungarvan, then staying with a friend in Dublin. Knowing the poor fisherman of Abbeyside and his family well, he enquired further into the matter, had an interview with the supposed lunatic, learned how he had been duped, and ultimately contrived his release from the asylum. Crow would not return home, fearing the ridicule that certainly awaited him, and but he wrote to his father, described all his adventures, and, amongst other matters, told him that "the *thing* he knew was a paving-stone!" This letter was read, as we have stated, in open court, at the witch's subsequent trial, and it convulsed the jury, and the entire assemblage with laughter. The recollection of that scene has been revivied by the extraordinary revelations at the trial, on Wednesday, of the Carrick Witch, who seems to have learned her craft from this audacious imposter, who, we should mention, was also sentenced to a year's imprisonment and hard labour. Mary Doheny was present in court all through that trial, and was there in charge of Coustable Goulden, of this town, as a witness in a prosecution brought against a prisoner for stealing a firkin of butter from Mr. Mulcahy, J.P.,of Ballymakee.

```

Thus far, I have only found a single report of that case, which had perhaps become somewhet embellished in the way it was (mis)remembered in the decade since it had occurred.

DUNGARVAN QUARTER SESSIONS

EXTRAORDINARY CASE — GOLD DIGGING.

Margaret and Sarah Murphy were charged John Crowe of Abbey side, Dungarvan, with feloniously taking one pair of shoes, one pair of stockings, and several other articles of wearing apparel belonging to his daughter, on the 22d Sept. last.

Mr. Barron brought before the court, in a facetious manner, that this case was linked with one of the most extraordinary acts, he might say of necromancy or magic, which has ever occurred in the county Waterford, or perhaps in Ireland. It appears that this ingenious piece of imposition had been practised and carried out effectually by the prisoners at the bar, and so far worked their part on the simplicity and credulity of John Crowe and family that they actually believed the statement to be quite correct. Some time since prisoners called to the house of Crowe and informed him that there had been some hidden treasures at the Abbeyside old castle, which was destined for no other persons except Crowe's family (great laughter). From this information Crowe and his son-in-law seemed to be captivated in pondering over the crocks of gold they were in a short time to possess (laughter). The prisoners then accompanied the old Crowe and the young goose (the son-in-law being a tailor) to the wished-for spot, and of course commenced operations to seek for that much admired metal (laughter). They found it, and carefully rolled it up in a white cloth, placed it in a travelling bag purchased in town for the purpose, and given to Crowe's son-in-law, who was fully commissioned to make sale of it in Dublin (laughter). On his arrival in Dublin to make sale of the gold, I believe it would be morally impossible to describe his joy in thinking of his easily acquired wealth and independence; but when he examined the contents of the bag he found about 30lbs weight of a stone (roars of laughter). Now gentlemen I shall read for you the communication which has been received from him to his father-in-law, John Crowe, and it is then for you to judge for yourselves:

[At the reading of this classic production it is impossible to describe with any sort of accuracy the side-splitting laughter which pervaded the whole court during the time Mr. Barron was stating the case. The following is verbatim copy of the letter:

"Dublin, September 25, 1853  
"Dear Sir— This is to inform you that we arrived here on saturday Night about 10 o'clock I am sorry to inform you that we were disapiointed in what you no. i was surprised on Sunday Morning when i opened me Bag and found nothing but a large stone i was surprised when i looked at it Mary an I were Near Dropping in the room when we saw it here we are now in a Bad state Don't know what to do in the wide world we are also fretting A Bout ye not nowing But ye would Be Robbed of all ye have in the house what will we do at all we are going to Liverpool tomorrow with a Bear pocket and trouble mind But there is No help for it — keep up your courage it is No use to Be fretting no more at present from JOHN CRANAGE Read this yourself  
"To Mr John Crowe, Abbeyside.

Mr. John Crowe was called to state his complaint against the prisoners—he was sworn, and stated that the prisoner Margaret Murphy called into his house and told him and his son-in-law, John Crannage, that there was great riches for them Abbeyside Old Castle (great laughter).

Court—Did yon go there with the party?

Witness—Begor I did so gintlemen (great laughter)

Court—Why did you go?

Witness—O, to be sure to get the money (laughter).

Court— Did she promise you the gold was there?

Witness—Begor she did and no mistake (great laughter). Though I went there with them, I knew there was none, but went to please the party (great laughter).

Court—You must be a silly man to be guided by such a person?

Witness—Begor I was the sufferer myself, I gave £1 19s. 4d. to my son-in-law, to carry him to Dublin, to sell the gold, but since I got the letter from him, it turned out to be 30lb of a large stone —(roars of laughter)—and in addition, she stole shoes and stockings, and my daughter's clothes (great laughter).

Court—Did you think that you would be very rich?

Witness—No, because we got letter it was a stone (laughter).

Here the witness entered into minute details, how the prisoner and her daughter effected the robbery, and was most laughable, which commanded the attention of the court for some time.

Sarah Crannage was next called as witness—Stated that the prisoner called into her house on the 22nd September, and told her that there was a great treasure hidden in Abbeyside Old Castle, which would raise her and her whole family, if she would keep secret (great laughter).

Witness—I said would there be any harm in going for it?

Prisoner said not at all, it would worse to have it hid there in such bad times, and so many wanting it (great laughter).

Witness—I believed she was telling the truth, as she (the prisoner) said it was for the family of the Crowes, and no other person could get it.

Court—Did you suppose that you would be very rich in the course of a short time after hearing such intelligence?

Witness—I did think so until I go f the letter from my husband (John Crannage), from Dublin, and then I knew the gold was a large stone (roars of laughter).

Court—So your fancied riches at once changed into a stone?

Witness—indeed it did, for which I am sorry —(great laughter)— my husband went to Dublin to sell it, and my sister too.

Court—Did they sell the gold?

Witness—O no, it turned out to be a stone (roars of laughter.)

Court—Did the prisoner effect the robbery with which you charge her?

Witness—I lent them the shawl, the frock, the apron, &c., &c., to appear someway decent to go to mass, but instead of that they ran away towards Waterford, and my poor old father aged about 60 years, had to strip off his shoes and hat and follow them through the country with a red handkerchief on his head, crying out stop the thief, but the people thought he was cracked (roars of laughter).

Father—Yes, I paid shilling to boy to follow them when I got tired myself—(roars of laughter) and when he brought them back I knew them right well, and so I ought, they destroyed and killed me (great laughter).

Witness—The prisoner (Margaret Murphy), also stole 7s. 6d. in my house, from us at the time they went off with my clothes.

The Constable produced the property stolen which was identified by the witness.

His Worship after recapitulating the most extraordinary acts of the imposter sentenced Margaret Murphy to 4 years penal imprisonment, and her young daughter the other prisoner at the bar to 12 months imprisonment. Here the laughable scene closed.

Mary Doheny's case also attracted some commentary from a wider cultural perspective.

The *Morning News* referring to the conviction of Mary Doheny for witchcraft at Carrick-on-Suir says: "We will not say that Mrs. Mary Doheny did not deserve the punishment to which Mr. Sergeant Howley has condemned her. She was decidedly behind the age. It is too late in the day now to talk of bestowing creature comforts on "spirits." Public taste or public credulity tends in a different direction. To shy a guitar at a man's head, to knot and unloosen a rope, to rap on a table, or draw a person up by his hair, are the sort of manifestations which it is correct to believe in at present. Spirits may do all these things, but they never eat, nor do they ever return to their former friends to look for second hand clothing. Mrs Doheny was but a stupid practitioner, and she deserves the full force of her sentence, if it were only for ignorance of the received notions of spiritualism."

WITCHCRAFT

(From the *Globe*)

When we read that Mary Doheny, "Carrick Witch," is told from the Bench that she "is a terrible woman and a dangerous impostor," and sentenced to twelve months' imprisonment with hard labour, we are almost led to think what might be the best means of treating the Brothers Davenport, and the whole herd of spiritualist impostors with their impudent and mendacious *chaperons*. It is impossible to deny that Mary Doheny has some reason to complain, for during the long period for which she destined to suffer confinement, with poor diet and hard work, numberless *seances* will no doubt be given, at which the British Folly will be more or less numerously represented, and for which the British sovereign will be liberally poured forth to the aggrandizement of the spiritualists, and possibly with no disadvantage to those upon whose respectable recommendation the public gives them audience. Mary Doheny aimed at bringing the dead to life again, not merely in their spiritual essence, but to all appearances corporeally and in the shape in which they had their material being. What is more, she succeeded to the satisfaction of at least some of her audience. One woman, who was examined as a witness against her, swore that she used to see her dead father, and other dead members of her family in the moat at Ballydine, and several letters were received purporting to come from the deceased relatives.—The prisoner said she wanted bread, butter, and tea for the people in the moat, and these were daily supplied during four months. The witness also fancied that she saw her own deceased father. "He was sitting in a chair opposite the door—quite near her, having on a blue coat, knee-breeches, and a hat. He said three times he was going, and that he would return with plenty; and the prisoner said he was going with 'the gentry,' but would return." Since her arrest there was no appearance from the other world. The husband of this woman, a sub-constable, also deposed that he saw and knew his father-in-law, who was only twenty yards from him. "He believed that the man had come to life, and thought he had a ghostly appearance. He never saw a dead man standing before. He saw his son also in an empty house where he was brought by the prisoner. He, too, had a ghostly appearance, and had not the shape of a living person, and the prisoner stated that it would take a considerable time for him to come to perfection." If, instead of having to account for these things before Sergeant Howley and a Clonmel jury, on a charge of fraudently obtaining goods, Mary Doheny could perform her tricks in a London drawingroom before a number of gentlemen, distinguished or not distinguished, she would probably have a good prosperous season, and an ample supply of palpable bottled spirits above proof, instead of twelve months' hard labour in Clonmel gaol.

LETTER NDON London, Monday Night. ... 

THE SPIRITS AND THE CONJURORS

But as for excitement, what can you hope for from "educated and intelligent" people who are still going crazy about the "spiritual" manifestations of the Davenport Brothers. Proclamations and challenges of Messrs. Tolmaque and Anderson, the two great conjurers, instead of damning the clever Yankees, have only increased the excitement about them. And it was only natural, as I will show. Tolmaque performs most clever tricks with the ropes. Now, utterly as I disbelieve in "spiritualism," I must frankly tell you that Tolmaque's feat of legerdemain exhibits no real resemblance to the things done by the Brothers Davenport. It is always better to know the full truth. Tolmaque is tied firmly with a rope, hands and feet, and then, slipping behind a screen, suddenly and cleverly disengages himself, and then as suddenly and cleverly ties himself again. This is confessedly sleight-of-hand.— Now, what happens in the case of the Brothers Davenport is this: they are tied hands and feet most carefully, until it seems impossible for them to move hand or foot. They hold, if desired, flour in their clenched hands, and the knots of the ropes are sealed with wax and a signet ring. Yet instruments laid beside them are made to play, or are flung about the room by some invisible propelling power; naked hands and arms are seen in the air, and locks and fastenings are burst open. Again, when they sit round a table, so tied, and held firmly by gentlemen at either side, the ropes suddealy uncoil, and are flung to a distance—in one instance actually dropped round a gentleman's neck at the opposite side of the table—whilst rings are whipped off a spectator's fingers and forced on those of the mediums; and all this time musical instruments float through the air, and invisible hands touch people's knees. Again, when one of the brothers is tied, his coat is drawn off him by some mysterious means; and, when the light is suddenly put on, he is found bound in his shirt-sleeves the same as before, whilst the flour in his hands is unspilled. How all this is done, I don't know; but I know it is done; and, to say the very least, the thing is astoundingly clever. The tricks of Tolmaque and Anderson are not one-thousandth part as clever; and until they can equal these "manifestations," their challenges and denunciations only increase the excitement about the Yankee mediums. In the meantime, a Mr. Palmer, who curiously calls himself "Manager of the Brothers Davenport," offers to pay down one hundred pounds if either Tolmaque or Andereox will come and do what the Davenports have done. It is significant that the challenge is declined.

But do not fancy for a moment that this Davenport business is the only "spiritual" exhibition in London. There are hundreds of private and respectable families here in which table turning and spirit-rapping are constantly indulged in, and hundreds of unfortunate persons, male and female (some of them not undistinguished in literature), believe—poor demented souls—that they are in constant communication with "the departed spirits of the mighty dead." To this length of mental imbecility have people progressed in the nineteenth century, and in the greatest city in the world.— Yet, Mrs. Doheny, the Tipperary "witch," has got twelve months' imprisonment for being more clever even than the Davenports. This is hardly even justice.

HOW DIFFERENT IMPOSTORS ARE TREATED.

Dublin, Saturday.— Mr. Serjeant Howley, the Chairman of Tipperary, has sentenced Mrs. Doheny, "the Carrick-on-Suir witch," to twelve months' imprisonment and hard labour, and yet the Davenport Brothers—Fay and Ferguson—are at in London! The "manifestations" of the witch are evidently not in sccord with the spirit of the day or the civilisation of the century; and yet I think that, for a rustic or whatever else you like to call it, her tricks were as good—nay, much better—and far more wonderful, than those I see reported as having been performed at the *séances* of the confraternity I have mentioned. Yet, such is the state of the law in the two countries — such is the injustice with which this integral portion of the British empire is governed and lawed, that English-made law metes out to the Irish manifestationist twleve months' imprisonment, accompanied and varied with "hard labour" while in England the "profession" is not only tolerated and patronised, but the law is such that to designate the Davepport company humbugs would be libellous and defamatory, and subject the libeller to severe pains and penalties. Mrs. Doheny's, of the two, were the cleverer "manifestations". In an open field—not in a drawing reom with reduced lights and a specially contrived and constructed cabinet—she invoked, not sounds and invisible assistance from the "other world," but real *bonâ fide* personages, so far unspiritualised as to have capital appetites and capricious and fastidious tastes and fancies. She used NO spirit impalpable hand to blow her own trumpet or sound her tambourine; but she "manifested," before the representatives of the authorities, their long lost, dead-and-buried friends; and for this grand, scientific, philanthropic "manifestation" she is ruthlessly tried, condemned, and sentenced to an ignoble and vulgar penalty that would more befit one who obtained money under false pretences.— But Mrs. Doheny's great mistake—the rock on which she was wrecked—was the "witals" anddainty nourishment she insisted on supplying to her "manifestations." Had she not so to provide for their creature comforts she would, perhaps, be to-day as free as Davenport of Fay.— Had she, like them, confined her "unaccountable operations" to the appearance of the mystic soft, delicate looking hand— to causing her broomstick to fly round the room—to drawing the body of a police constable, not to an adjoining field, but up to the ceiling by the head's hair, or to the production of an uneuphonious concert between the pots and pans, the kettle and tongs, of her humble hovel—her phenomena would have supplied worthy subject for the investigations of Charles Dunup, the "special correspondent" of the "unblushing *Recorder*," and "milo'd" know-nothing. But, alas, Mrs. Doheny, your country was your cure! You were "mere Irish," and you have been crushed out by the laws of the stranger. You have been tried, convicted, and imprisoned, while your would-be rivals and imitators, Davenport, Fay, & Co. are free. But they are in England and you are in Ireland, and that's the difference.— Yes; *we* punish such audacious humbugs, *they* encourage and cultivate them — *Dublin Correspondent of Morning Star*.

CREDULITY IN HIGH AND LOW PLACES.—Last week a woman was tried in Ireland, and sentenced to imprisonment and hard labour, for obtaining goods by false and fraudulent pretences—a not uncommon offence, but made remarkable in this case by the extraordinary nature of the pretences used. The woman had the art to persuade several persons that their deceased relatives had returned to life, and found them sufficiently credulous to believe that they saw the deceased persons at a place to which she took them for the purpose. Acting upon this belief, they were easily induced to give bread, butter, tea, and other articles of food to the impostor for the use of their relations, who, they were made to believe were living with the "good people," or fairies, and who appear to have been personated by the woman's husband. 

TO DO Her dupes seem to have given their evidence reluctantly, and to still cherish their strange belief in her supernatural powers. This Tipperary witch may consider herself fortunate in having been born in the nineteenth century, instead of in the seventeenth, when she would have been likely to have suffered drowning or hanging after being subjected to torture. But what shall we say of those who were so easily made her dupes? The common nostrum for such cases is a farther diffusion of education; but the history of human credulity teaches us that the educated are as liable to delusion as the illiterate. It was not the poor and ignorant classes of French society who attended the *seances* of the impostor self-styled Count Cagliostro, at which he pretended to raise the dead, and put the living in communication with their long deceased friends and relatives. But that, it may be said, was a long while ago; and science has since illuminated the human mind to such an extent that instances of such credulity are now confined to the least educated portion of the people. Is this so? The question is sufficiently answered by reference to the so-called "spiritual manifestations," of which so much has been heard of late years, and which have lately derived additional prominence from the performances of the Brothers Davenport.

It is to be observed that the distinction between the so-called spiritual phenomena exhibited by Mr. Forster, Mr. Home, and the Brothers Davenport, and the conjuring tricks of M. Robin, Herr Frikell, and Mr. Anderson, is, that while the latter acknowledge their feats to be performed by *legerdemain*, or by scientific agency, the former declare themselves involuntary agents, through whom a supernatural power is exercised independently, and without any knowledge on their parts of the mode of operation. There seems no difference, therefore, between the case of the self-styled "spiritual mediums" and that of the humbler professor of the black art whose essays in necromancy have just led to her incarceration in the county gaol of Tipperary. It was Mary Doheny's misfortune, not her fault, that she lived in a hut in Tipperary, and had only the ignorant peasantry around her to practice upon; while the Brothers Davenport, heralded by reports of their marvellous performances in America, are able to gather at their seances the rank, the wealth, and the intellect of Britain. How many of their patrons really believe their assertions that they are involuntary agents in the knot-untying, phantom-hand exhibiting and musical acrobatic business, we know not; but there is evidently a credulous as well as an incredulous section of the gatherings at Mr. Boucicault's and the Hanover-square Rooms. This is quite evident from the letters which have appeared in the metropolitan journals from persons who do not attempt to conceal their belief, or half-belief, that the "manifestations" are something different to, and far above, the tricks of the professional conjuror.

The cause of this extraordinary credulity of educated men and women may perhaps be found, strange as it may seem, in the great progress which science has made during the last quarter of a century. Science enters so little into the system of education pursued at the universities and public schools, that what is called the popularization of science applies as much to minds that receive the highest development which teaching can produce, as to those of the less educated classes. The wonders of modern science, of chemistry, of electricity, of optics, are known; but the knowledge of them seldom extends beyond effects, while of the causes of scientific phenomena, of what the learned call the laws by which they are produced, there are few unprofessional persons who know anything. The sentiment of wonder is appealed to so strongly and so frequently in the present day, at one time by some new application of electricity, at another by an improvement in photography, or some great discovery in acoustics, that the mind, in the state of partial illumination which must be the condition of most persons, is ready to give credence to the most extraordinary things that may be presented to it. The marvels of electro-biology, of clairvoyance, of table-turning, spirit-rapping, the spurious phenomena of phantom hands and guitar-strumning by invisible fingers, do not seem more impossible to minds in this condition than the electric telegraph or photographic portraiture. The majority of those who reject the latter description of marvels may not be better informed than those who believe in their reality, but their minds are differently constituted. Phrenologists would say that the sceptics have the organ of wonder very slightly developed; they are disposed to refer marvels, spurious or genuine, to natural causes, even though they may not understand them. The believers in spiritualism—that is, the spurious spiritualism of the Forsters, Homes, and Davenports —are inclined, on the other hand, to credit the assertion that the marvels which they do not understand are produced by supernatural agency. The more real marvels science produces, the more they are disposed to give credence to the tricks which the charlatan achieves under the mask of the philosopher.
