# The Three Heads of the Well

When we first started going to stories 25 years or so ago, this is one of tales I remember being frquently told, and one of my favourites to listen to, perhaps becuase of that, perhaps becuase of the repeated refrain, with each teller having their own variant, perhaps because of the comic potential. I first starting telling it for the 'Tis Tales "Spring Tales" set, in Spring, 2023.

The Three Heads of the Well

LONG before Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table, there reigned in the eastern part of England a king who kept his Court at Colchester. In the midst of all his glory, his queen died, leaving behind her an only daughter, about fifteen years of age, who for her beauty and kindness was the wonder of all that knew her. But the king hearing of a lady who had likewise an only daughter, had a mind to marry her for the sake of her riches, though she was old, ugly, hook nosed, and hump-backed. Her daughter was a yellow dowdy, full of envy and ill-nature; and, in short, was much of the same mould as her mother. But in a few weeks the king, attended by the nobility and gentry, brought his deformed bride to the palace, where the marriage rites were performed. They had not been long in the Court before they set the king against his own beautiful daughter by false reports. The young princess having lost her father's love, grew weary of the Court, and one day, meeting with her father in the garden, she begged him, with tears in her eyes, to let her go and seek her fortune ; to which the king consented, and ordered her mother-in-law to give her what she pleased. She went to the queen, who gave her a canvas bag of brown bread and hard cheese, with a bottle of beer ; though this was but a pitiful dowry for a king's daughter. She took it, with thanks, and proceeded on her journey, passing through groves, woods, and valleys, till at length she saw an old man sitting on a stone at the mouth of a cave, who said : " Good morrow, fair maiden, whither away so fast?"

" Aged father," says she, " I am going to seek my fortune."

" What have you got in your bag and bottle ?"

" In my bag I have got bread and cheese, and in my bottle good small beer. Would you like to have some ?"

" Yes," said he, " with all my heart."

With that the lady pulled out her provisions, and bade him eat and welcome. He did so, and gave her many thanks, and said : " There is a thick thorny hedge before you, which you cannot get through, but take this wand in your hand, strike it three times, and say, " Pray, hedge, let me come through," and it will open immediately ; then, a little further, you will find a well ; sit down on the brink of it, and there will come up three golden heads, which will speak; and whatever they require, that do." Promising she would, she took her leave of him. Coming to the hedge and using the old man's wand, it divided, and let her through ; then, coming to the well, she had no sooner sat down than a golden head came up singing :

" Wash me, and comb me,  
And lay me down softly.  
And lay me on a bank to dry,  
That I may look pretty.  
When somebody passes by."

"Yes," said she, and taking it in her lap combed it with a silver comb, and then placed it upon a primrose bank. Then up came a second and a third head, saying the same as the former. So she did the same for them, and then, pulling out her provisions, sat down to eat her dinner.

Then said the heads one to another : " What shall we weird for this damsel who has used us so kindly?"

The first said : " I weird her to be so beautiful that she shall charm the most powerful prince in the world."

The second said: "I weird her such a sweet voice that shall far exceed the nightingale."

The third said : " My gift shall be none of the least, as she is a king's daughter, I'll weird her so fortunate that she shall become queen to the greatest prince that reigns."

She then let them down into the well again, and so went on her journey. She had not travelled long before she saw a king hunting in the park with his nobles. She would have avoided him, but the king, having caught a sight of her, approached, and what with her beauty and sweet voice, fell desperately in love with her, and soon induced her to marry him.

This king finding that she was the King of Colchester's daughter, ordered some chariots to be got ready, that he might pay the king, his father-in-law, a visit. The chariot in which the king and queen rode was adorned with rich gems of gold. The king, her father, was at first astonished that his daughter had been so fortunate, till the young king let him know of all that had happened. Great was the joy at Court amongst all, with the exception of the queen and her club-footed daughter, who were ready to burst with envy. The rejoicings, with feasting and dancing, continued many days. Then at length they returned home with the dowry her father gave her.

The hump-backed princess, perceiving that her sister had been so lucky in seeking her fortune, wanted to do the same ; so she told her mother, and all preparations were made, and she was furnished with rich dresses, and with sugar, almonds, and sweetmeats, in great quantities, and a large bottle of Malaga sack. With these she went the same road as her sister ; and coming near the cave, the old man said : " Young woman, whither so fast?"

" What's that to you ? " said she.

" Then," said he, " what have you in your bag and bottle ? "

She answered : " Good things, which you shall not be troubled with."

"Won't you give me some?" said he.

" No, not a bit, nor a drop, unless it would choke you."

The old man frowned, saying : " Evil fortune attend ye!"

Going on, she came to the hedge, through which she espied a gap, and thought to pass through it ; but the hedge closed, and the thorns ran into her flesh, so that it was with great difficulty that she got through. Being now all over blood, she searched for water to wash herself, and looking round, she saw the well. She sat down on thw brink of it, and one of the heads came up, saying : " Wash me, comb me, and lay me down softly," as before, but she banged it with her bottle, saying, "Take that for your washing." So the second and third heads came up, and met with no better treatment than the first. Whereupom the heads consulted among themselves what evils to plague her with for such usage.

The first said : " Let her be struck with leprosy in her face."

The second : " Let her voice be as harsh as a corn-crake's."

The third said : " Let her have for husband but a poor country cobbler."

Well, she goes on till she came to a town, and it being market-day, the people looked at her, and, seeing such a mangy face, and hearing such a squeaky voice, all fled but a poor country cobbler. Now he not long before had mended the shoes of an old hermit, who, having no money, gave him a box of ointment for the cure of the leprosy, and a bottle of spirits for a harsh voice. So the cobbler having a mind to do an act of charity, was induced to go up to her and ask her who she was.

" I am," said she, " the King of Colchester's daughter-in-law."

"Well," said the cobbler, "if I restore you to your natural complexion, and make a sound cure both in face and voice, will you in reward take me for a husband?"

"Yes, friend," replied she, "with all my heart!"

With this the cobbler applied the remedies, and they made her well in a few weeks ; after which they were married, and so set forward for the Court at Colchester, When the queen found that her daughter had married nothing but a poor cobbler, she hanged herself in wrath. The death of the queen so pleased the king, who was glad to get rid of her so soon, that he gave the cobbler a hundred pounds to quit the Court with his lady, and take to a remote part of the kingdom, where he lived many years mending shoes, his wife spinning the thread for him. 

NOTES:

XLIII. THE THREE HEADS OF THE WELL. 

Source, — Halliwell, p. 158. The second wish has been somewhat euphemised. 

Parallels, — The story forms part of Peele's Old Wives' Tales where the rhyme was 

*A Head rises in the well*,  
Fair maiden, white and red,  
Stroke me smooth and comb my head,  
And thou shalt have some cockell-bread.

It is also in Chambers, *l.c.*, [Popular Rhymes of Scotland], 105, where the well is at the World's End (cf. No. xli.). The contrasted fates of two step-sisters, is the Frau Holle (Grimm, No. 24) type of Folk-tale studied by Cosquin, i. 250, seq.  Kate Crackernuts" (No. xxxvii.) is a pleasant contrast to this.

THE WAL AT THE WARLD's END (Fife).

There was a king and a queen, and the king had a dochter, and the queen had a dochter. And the king's dochter was bonnie and guid-natured, and a'body liket her ; and the queen's dochter was ugly and ill-natured, and naebody liket her. And the queen didna like the king's dochter, and she wanted her awa'. Sae she sent her to the wal at the warld's end, to get a bottle o' water, thinking she would never come back. Weel, she took her bottle, and she gaed and gaed or [ere] she cam to a pownie that was tethered, and the pownie said to her :

' Flit me, flit me, my bonnie May, For I haena been flitted this seven year and a day.'

And the king's dochter said : ' Ay will I, my bonnie pownie, I 'll flit ye.' Sae the pownie ga'e her a ride owre the muir o' hecklepins.

Weel, she gaed far and far and farer nor I can tell, or she cam to the wal at the warld's end ; and when she cam to the wal, it was awfu' deep, and she couldna get her bottle dippit And as she was lookin' doon, thinkin' hoo to do, there lookit up to her three scaud men's heads, and they said to her :

' Wash me, wash me, my bonnie May, And dry me wi' yer clean linen apron.'

And she said : ' Ay will I ; I'll wash ye.' Sae she washed the three scaud men's heads, and dried them wi' her clean linen, apron ; and syne they took and dippit her bottle for her. And the scaud men's heads said the tane to the tither :

' Weird, brother, weird, what'll ye weird?'

And the first ane said : ' I weird that if she was bonnie afore , she'll be ten times bonnier.' And the second ane said: 'I weird that ilka time she speaks, there'll a diamond and a ruby and a pearl drap oot o' her mouth. And the third ane said : ' I weird that ilka time she kaims her head, she'll get a peck o' gould and a peck o' siller oot o' it.'

Weel, she cam hame to the king's coort again, and if she was bonnie afore, she was ten times bonnier; and ilka time she opened her lips to speak, there was a diamond and a ruby and a pearl drappit oot o' her mouth ; and ilka time she kaimed her head, she gat a peck o' gould and a peck o' silver oot o't. And the queen was that vext, she didna ken what to do, but she thocht she wad send her ain dochter to see if she could fa' in wi' the same luck. Sae she ga'e her a bottle, and tell't her to gang awa' to the wal at the warid's end, and get a bottle o' water.

Weel, the queen's dochter gaed and gaed or she cam to the pownie, an' the pownie said :

' Flit me, flit me, my bonnie May, For I haeria been flitted this seven year and a day.'

And the queen's dochter said : ' Ou ye nasty beast, do ye think I'll flit ye ? Do ye ken wha ye 're speakin' till ? I 'm a queen's dochter.' Sae she wadna flit the pownie, and the pownie wadna gie her a ride owre the muir o' hecklepins. And she had to gang on her bare feet, and the hecklepins cuttit a' her feet, and she could hardly gang ava.

Weel, she gaed far and far and farer nor I can tell, or she cam to the wal at the warld's end. And the wal was deep, and she couldna get her bottle dippit ; and as she was lookin' doon, thinkin' hoo to do, there lookit up to her three scaud men's heads, and they said till her :

' Wash me, wash me, my bonnie May, And dry me wi' yer clean linen apron.'

And she said : ' Ou ye nasty dirty beasts, div ye think I 'm gaunie wash ye ? Div ye ken wha ye 're speakin' till ? I 'm a queen's dochter.' Sae she wadna wash them, and they wadna dip her bottle for her.

And the scaud men's heads said the tane to the tither :

' Weird, brother, weird, what'll ye weird ? '

And the first ane said : ' I weird that if she was ugly afore, she'll be ten times uglier.' And the second said : ' I weird that ilka time she speaks, there'll a puddock and a taid loup oot o' her mouth.' And the third ane said : ' And I weird that ilka time she kaims her head, she'll get a peck o' lice and a peck o' flechs oot o't.' Sae she gaed awa hame again, and if she was ugly afore, she was ten times uglier; and ilka time (&c.). Sae they had to send her awa' fra the king's coort. And there was a bonnie young prince cam and married the king's dochter ; and the queen's dochter had to put up wi' an auld cobbler, and he lickit her ilka day wi' a leather strap. Sae ye see, bairns, &c.

[This peculiarly weird tale, in some of its features, reminds us of the common fairy stories; and yet it probably is of great antiquity. A tale of the *Wolf of the Warldis End* (wolf being doubtless a misprint for well) is mentioned in the Complaynt of Scotland, 1548.]

XIX. The Tale of the Wolf of the Warldis End, is likewise lost, as no MS. copy has been preserved. The romance, for the convenience of singing or narration, has probably been melted down by tradition into detached fragments, from which songs and nursery tales have been formed. I have heard fragments of songs repeated, in which the " well of the warldis end is mentioned," and denominated " the well Absalom, " and " the *cald well* sae weary. " According to the popular tale, a lady is sent by her stepmother to draw water from the well of the world's end. " She arrives at the well, after encountering many dangers ; but soon perceives that her adventures have not reached a conclusion. A frog emerges from the well, and, before it suffers her to draw water, obliges her to betrothe herself to the monster, under the penalty of being torn to pieces. The lady returns safe ; but at midnight the frog-lov trs at the door, and demands entrance, according to promise, to the great consternation of the lady and her nurse.

" Open the door, my hinny, my hart,  
Open the door, mine ain wee thing ;  
And mind the words that you & I spak  
Down in the meadow, at the well-spring. "

The frog is admitted, and addresses her —

" Take me up on your knee, my dearie,  
Take me up on your knee, my dearie ;  
And mind the words that you & I spak  
At the cauld well sac weary. "

The frog is finally disenchanted, and appears as a prince, in his original form.

In the romance of Roswall and Lilian, it is said, that

" The knight that kept the Pavent well,  
Was not so fair as Roswall. "

Whether these circumstances have any relation to this romance, I cannot determine.

THE THREE HEADS OF THE WELL.

`[This story is abridged from the old chap-book of the Three Kings of Colchester. The incident of the heads rising out of the well is very similar to one introduced in Peele’s Old Wives T'ale, 1595, and the verse is also of a similar character.]`

Long before Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table, there reigned in the eastern part of England a king who kept his court at Colchester. He was witty, strong, and valiant, by which means he subdued his enemies abroad, and secured peace among his subjects at home. Nevertheless, in the midst of his glory, his queen died, leaving behind her an only daughter, about fifteen years of age. This lady, from her courtly carriage, beauty, and affability, was the wonder of all that knew her ; but, as covetousness is said to be the root of all evil, so it happened in this instance. The king hearing of a lady who had likewise an only daughter, for the sake of her riches had a mind to marry; though she was old, ugly, hook-nosed, and humpbacked, yet all this could not deter him from marrying her. Her daughter, also, was a yellow dowdy, full of envy and illnature; and, in short, was much of the same mould as her mother. This signified nothing, for in a few weeks the king, attended by the nobility and gentry, brought his intended bride to his palace, where the marriage rites were performed. They had not been long in the court before they set the king against his own beautiful daughter, which was done by false reports and accusations. The young princess, having lost her father’s love, grew weary of the court, and one day meeting with her father in the garden, she desired him, with tears in her eyes, to give her a small subsistence, and she would go and seek her fortune; to which the king consented, and ordered her mother-in-law to make up a small sum according to her discretion. She went to the queen, who gave her a canvass bag of brown bread and hard cheese, with a bottle of beer; though this was but a very pitiful dowry for a king’s daughter. She took it, returned thanks, and proceeded on her journey, passing through groves, woods, and valleys, till at length she saw an old man sitting on a stone at the mouth of a cave, who said, "Good morrow, fair maiden, whither away so fast?" "Aged father," says she, "I am going to seek my fortune." " What has thou in thy bag and bottle ?" "In my bag I have got bread and cheese, and in my bottle good small beer; will you please to partake of either?" ‘Yes," said he, "with all my heart." With that the lady pulled out her provisions, and bid him eat and welcome. He did so, and gave her many thanks, saying thus: "There is a thick thorny hedge before you, which will appear impassable, but take this wand in your hand, strike three times, and say, ' Pray, hedge, let me come through,’ and it will open immediately ; then, a little further, you will find a well; sit down on the brink of it, and there will come up three golden heads, which will speak : pray do whatever they require." Promising she would follow his directions, she took her leave of him. Arriving at the hedge, and pursuing the old man’s directions, it divided, and gave her a passage; then, going to the well, she had no sooner sat down than a golden head came up singing—

Wash me, and comb me,  
And lay me down softly,  
And lay me on a bank to dry,  
That I may look pretty,  
When somebody comes by.

" Yes," said she, and putting forth her hand, with a silver comb performed the office, placing it upon a primrose bank. Then came up a second and a third head, making the same request, which she complied with. She then pulled out her provisions and ate her dinner. Then said the heads one to another, " What shall we do for this lady who hath used us so kindly ?" The first said, "I will cause such addition to her beauty as shall charm the most powerful prince in the world." The second said, "I will endow her with such perfume, both in body and breath, as shall far exceed the sweetest flowers." The third said, "My gift shall be none of the least, for, as she is a king’s daughter, I’ll make her so fortunate that she shall become queen to the greatest prince that reigns." This done, at their request she let them down into the well again, and so proceeded on her journey. She had not travelled long before she saw a king hunting: in the park with his nobles; she would have avoided him, but the king having caught a sight of her, approached, and what with her beauty and perfumed breath, was so powerfully smitten, that he was not able to subdue his passion, but commenced his courtship immediately, and was so successful that he gained her love, and, conducting her to his palace, he caused her to be clothed in the most magnificent manner.

This being ended, and the king finding that she was the king of Colchester’s daughter, ordered some chariots to be got ready, that he might pay the king a visit. The chariot in which the king and queen rode was adorned with rich ornamental gems of gold. The king, her father, was at first astonished that his daughter had been so fortunate as she was, till the young king made him sensible of all that happened. Great was the joy at court amongst all, with the exception of the queen and her club-footed daughter, who were ready to burst with malice, and envied her happiness; and the greater was their madness because she was now above them all. Great rejoicings, with feasting and dancing, continued many days. Then at length, with the dowry her father gave her they returned home.

The deformed daughter perceiving that her sister had been so happy in seeking her fortune, would needs do the same; so disclosing her mind to her mother, all preparations were made, and she was furnished not only with rich apparel, but sweetmeats, sugar, almonds, &c., in great quantities, and a large bottle of Malaga sack. Thus provided, she went the same road as her sister, and coming near the cave, the old man said, " Young woman, whither so- fast?" "What is that to you," said she, "Then," said he, "what have you in your bag and bottle?’ She answered, ‘‘Good things, which you shall not be troubled with." "Won’t you give me some?" said he. ‘No, not a bit, nora drop, unless it would choke you... The old man frowned, saying, "Evil fortune attend thee." Going on, she came to the hedge, through which she espied a gap, and thought to pass through it, but, going in, the hedge closed, and the thorns run into her flesh, so that it was with great difficulty that she got out. Being now in a painful condition, she searched for water to wash herself, and, looking round, she saw the well; she sat down on the brink of it, and one of the heads came up, saying, "Wash me, comb me, and lay me down softly, &c." but she banged it with her bottle, saying, "Take this for your washing." So the second and third heads came up, and met with no better treatment than the first ; whereupon the heads consulted among themselves what evils to plague her with for such usage. The first said, "Let her be struck with leprosy in her face." The second, " Let an additional smell be added to her breath." The third bestowed on her a husband, though but a poor country cobler. This done, she goes on till she came to a town, and it being market day, the people looked at her, and seeing such an evil face fled out of her sight, all but a poor cobler (who not long before had mended the shoes of an old hermit, who having no money, gave him a box of ointment for the cure of the leprosy, and a bottle of spirits for a stinking breath). Now the cobler having a mind to do an act of charity, was induced to go up to her and ask her who she was. "I am," said she, "the king of Colchester’s daughterin-law." " Well," said the cobler, "if I restore you to your natural complexion, and make a sound cure both in face and breath, will you in reward take me for a husband?" "Yes, friend," replied she, "with all my heart." With this the cobler applied the remedies, and they worked the effect in a few weeks, and then they were married, and after a few days they set forward for the court at Colchester. When the queen understood she had married a poor cobler, she fell into distraction, and hanged herself for vexation. The death of the queen was not a source of sorrow to the king, who had only married her for her fortune, and bore her no affection; and shortly afterwards he gave the cobler a hundred pounds to take the daughter to a remote part of the kingdom, where he lived many years mending shoes, while his wife assisted the housekeeping by spinning, and selling the results of her labours at the country market.
