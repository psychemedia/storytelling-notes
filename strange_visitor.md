# The Strange Visitor

I first heard this from Hugh Lupton on the *Barefoot Books Podcast*, who frames the tale with opening and a closing settings, simplifies the body parts and the actions associated with them, and uses the refrains "*And still she sat, and still she sewed, and still she wished for company"* and *"Too much water, too little meat"*.

XXXII. THE STRANGE VISITOR

*Source.* — From Chambers, *l.c.* 64, much Anglicised. I have retained "Aih-late-wee-moul," though I candidly confess I have not the slightest idea what it means; judging other children by myself, I do not think that makes the response less effective. The prosaic-minded may substitute "Up-late-and-little-food."

*Parallels.* — The man made by instalments, occurs in the Grimms' No. 4, and something like it in an English folk-tale. *The Golden Ball*. *ap.* Henderson, *l.c.*, p. 333.

Chambers cited is 1870 version though the book dates back further at least two earlier editions (1847 and 1858), and the rhyme can be found in each

[The figure is meant for that of Death. The dialogue, towards the end, is managed in a low and drawling manner, so as to rivet the attention, and awaken an undefined awe in the juvenile audience. Thus wrought up, the concluding words come upon them with such effect as generally to cause a scream of alarm.]

THE OLD WOMAN AND HER COMPANY

Once there was an Old "Woman, and she lived all alone.

One night she sat by the fire spinning, and as she spun she said to herself, "I wish I had some one to talk to."

Just as she said these words two big, big feet came flying through the window,  
and stood by the fireplace.  
And still she sat.  
And still she spun.  
And still she wished for company.

In came two fat, fat legs,  
and fixed themselves at once on the big, big feet.  
And still she sat.  
And still she spun.  
And still she wished for company.

In came a wee, wee waist,  
and quick as a wink  
fixed itself on the fat, fat legs.  
And still she sat,  
And still she spun,  
And still she wished For company.

In came two broad, broad shoulders, and in the twinkling of an eye  
they were on the wee, wee waist.

And still she sat.  
And still she spun.  
And still she wished For company.

In came a big, big head, and in a flash settled down on the broad, broad shoulders.  
And there by the fire stood an Old, Old Man.  
The Old Woman stopped spinning, and looked at the Old Man.

"Where did you get such big feet?" she asked.

"Walking, walking, walking," said the Old Man.

"How did you get such fat legs?" asked the Old Woman.

"Climbing, climbing, climbing," said the Old Man.

"How did you get such a wee waist?" asked the Old Woman.

"Stretching, stretching, stretching," said the Old Man.

"How did you get such broad shoulders ?" asked the Old Woman.

"Carrying wood, carrying wood, carrying wood," said the Old Man.

"How did you get such a big head ?"  

asked the Old Woman.

![https://archive.org/details/progressiveroadt0000unse/page/30/mode/2up , 1912](images/progressive_strange_visitor2a.png)

"Thinking, thinking, thinking," said the Old Man.

"What did you come for?" asked the Old Woman.

"To have a good time," said the Old Man.  
And he jumped up, and began to dance with the broomstick.

The Old Woman jumped up, too, and began to dance with the fire shovel. And they danced and danced, and danced and danced, till they couldn't dance any more.

And it is said that the Old Woman was never lonesome afterward.
