2. General Character of the Work.

After a proem in which is lamented the slight value attached to wit and learning, the author announces his determination to present a supplication to the devil (161), and describes his search for a suitable messenger (162). He finds a 'knight of the post' who will undertake to deliver it, and hands him the supplication to read (164). The petition itself, that Pierce may be granted the fees which he deserves and that gold be set at liberty from the strong-boxes of the rich, occupies but a page (165-6), and the work then becomes a general attack upon abuses of all kinds. The chief subjects are Greediness, or Avarice (166) — Niggardize (167) — Pride (168) — An attack on Antiquaries (182)— Envy (183)— Murder (186)— Wrath (187)— The enemies of poetry (192) — An attack on Richard Harvey (195) — Gluttony (199)— Drunkenness (204)— Sloth (208)— A defence of plays (212)— Lechery (216). The supplication is followed by a discussion of the nature of hell and of devils (217-39), in which is inserted a tale, apparently allegorical, of a bear, a lion, and other animals (221-6). The work closes with an address to the reader (239) and a eulogy of 'Amyntas' (243).
