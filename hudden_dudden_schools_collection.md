There was once three men - Hudden Dudden and Donol O'Leary. They owned three farms. Hudden and Dudden became jealous of O'Leary and they said they would drown him. Hudden and Dudden went to O'Leary's house, seized him, put him in a sack and carried him to a lake nearby to drown him.

Just at that moment a hare jumped out, Hudden and Dudden dropped O'Leary and made after the Hare. In the meantime O'Leary heard a noise coming along the road:- "How, How, How." It was a driver with a herd of cattle. O'Leary began to sing:- Diddley-di, Diddley De. The herdsman said:- "You are very happy in there". "I sure am Sir, and if you were in my place you would be happy too." I am going to heaven in a few minutes". Is that so, said the herdsman if you will let me in your place I will give you my fifty herd of cattle and the hundred pounds I have in my pocket but you will have to loosen the sack and tie me up again. Hudden and Dudden came back and found the herdsman tied up in the sack and thinking it was O'Leary they picked him up and threw him into the lake.

When they came home they were surprised to see O'Leary with fifty herd of cattle and a hundred pounds in his pocket. Hudden and Dudden were talking between themselves how this thing came to pass. They at once went to O'Leary and asked him how he became so wealthy. O'Leary told them he said when ye fired me into the lake I went to the bottom and when I came up again the water was bubblin; I was calling for help and if I could get enough of drivers I could get twice as much cattle. Hudden and Dudden said:- "O' Will you show us where the place is, we would like to go down and get some cattle". "Right O" said O'Leary come along with me and I will show you where to jump in. When they came to the lake they were saying to each other:- "which of us will go in first". Hudden jumped in first, he came up snuffling the water. O'Leary said to Dudden "He is calling for help, Dudden jumped in, they both were drowned and Donol O'Leary had all the property. so:-

Put down the kettle and make the tay and if he doesn't be happy that we may.

Once upon a time there lived three men near each other. Each of them had a bullock and they used to do all their own work with them and they used to do work for other people in the district as well. Hudden and Dudden were the best of friends but they did not like Dan O'Neill at all for he used to get more work to do than them and they got jealous of him. Each of them lived with his mother.

One night Hudden and Dudden made up their minds and they killed Dan's bullock. The next morning when Dan went out to feed his bullock he found him and he was terrible vexed. He did not know what to do now when his bullock was killed for he would not have him to do his work or to earn money. Anyhow Dan made up his mind to sell the skin of the bullock. So one money he packed up the skin and put it on his shoulder and set off for the town. On his way a magpie came and sat on his shoulder and Dan put up his hand and caught him and what did he do but put the magpie into the skin and continued on his journey. When he came as far as the town he went into a public-house to have a "drop" for it was a cold wet morning. The publican filled out the whiskey and Dan lit his pipe and the magpie began chittering in the skin.

"What's that you have on your back," says the publican. "Oh," says Dan, "It's only a bullock's skin" and Dan put his ear to the skin pretending he was listening to what the skin was saying. "And what making the noise," says the publican. "Oh," says Dan, "That's only the skin talking." "And what is it saying now," says the publican. "It is saying that that whiskey is not good," says Dan. So the publican took back the whiskey and filled the glass from another bottle. "And what is it saying now," says the publican. "It is saying," says Dan, "That that's better whiskey," and Dan emptied the glass and was about to go away. "And do you intend to sell that skin," says the publican. "In deed I do not," says Dan. "Here take fifty pounds for it." "Well," says Dan, "As you bid me so much I will give it to you, but I never intended to sell it but maybe I may be able to get as good a one some other time."

That night when Dan went home Hudden and Dudden came in to ceilidhe with him to hear what Dan had to say about his bullock being killed. They said it was too bad about his bullock but Dan said how he got the fifty pounds for it and that if he had asked twice as much he would have got it as handy. That night when Hudden and Dudden when home they made up their minds to kill their bullocks and they did so. Next morning they set off for the town but when they got the length there was not one to ask them where they were going or what they had. When they had no bullocks and no money, so now they made up their minds to kill Dan's mother.

One night they came along and when Dan was out they killed his mother. When Dan came home and found his mother killed he was terrible vexed after her for he had nobody now to cook or wash for him but bad as it was he said he would set off with her to the town on his back. When he came near the town he went into a farmer's house to get something to eat. When the dinner was ready he told the farmer's daughter to go out and call in his mother for she was standing abroad at the well. "If she does not hear you, shout loud at her for she is a bit hard of hearing," says Dan. The girl went out and called and called but the old woman whom Dan had propped up at the well did not hear her. Then the girl went over and shook her and what did she do but throw Dan's mother into the well. The girl came in roaring and crying saying that the old woman fell into the well. The old farmer was in a terrible way and he offered to give Dan one hundred pounds and to say nothing about it. Dan said the case was bad but it could not be mended and he took the hundred pounds and set off for home.

That night Hudden and Dudden came to Dan to hear what he had to say about his mother. They said that it was a bad story about his mother. "Oh," says Dan, "It's nothing, I got a hundred pounds for her to-day," taking out the gold sovereigns and counting it on his hand before them. Says he, "If she was a young one, there is no knowing what I would be getting for her."

When Hudden and Dudden were going home they said that they would kill their mothers. So they did so and set off with them on their backs to the town. But when they reached the town they were arrested and put in goal and they were very nearly being hanged. Anyhow when they came home they were so angry with Dan that they made up their minds to kill him some night and get all the money.

So one day they came and took Dan with them in a bit bag and were carrying him off to a lake to drown him. When they were on their way to the lough they saw a hare and she appeared to be very lame and she was going very slowly. The two boys left down the bag and began to follow the hare but every time they thought to leave their hands on the hare she would jump away from them. Well, when they were away who comes along up a very big wealthy farmer with a bit drove of bullocks. When the farmer saw the bag he came over to it to see what was in it and Dan began to sing the finest ever you heard. The farmer was surprised and he asked Dan where he was going or what was wrong with him and Dan said he was going to heaven. Says the farmer, "I will exchange places with you," but Dan said he did not know as he might not get the chance again. But at length Dan came out and the farmer went into the bag and Dan set off home with the big drove of bullocks. When Hudden and Dudden came back they took the bag up on their shoulders to haul it into the lough. It was terrible bit heavy man and they had a bit load to carry. So when they reached the lough they threw him in. That night they went over to get Dan's money but they could not get near the house with all the cattle that were near the house. And when they saw Dan, they asked him how did he came by all the bullocks and Dan dais he got them in the lough but that if he had anyone to "cop" them he would have twice as many.

So Hudden and Dudden made up their minds to go into the bag the next day. Dan set off with them to the lough and threw them in and that was the last hat was seen of them. Dan came home and had money and cattle all and he lived happy and content from that day to this.
