# The Carrick Witch

As with the tragedy surrounding the death of Bridget Cleary, also reported from Clonmel almost thirty years later, the headline writers reporting on the case against Mary Dohenyin 1864 were quick to label this story as a case of "witchcraft".

In the case of Bridget Cleary, it was fairy supersitition, and more speciifically, the idea of fairy *changelings*, that was invoked to justify the behaviour of the defendants. For the Carrick witch, it was a fairy supersition regarding the ghosts of the dead walking once again, escorted by the "gentry" or"good people", that seems to explain the behaviour of the chief witnesses against the accused. As with the Cleary case, the tale was presented as an example of the prevalence of ancient supersition amongst the Irish peasantry, and received in court, in part at least, with laughter.

The tale begins with reports of a magisterial investigation:

A WITCH—MARVELLOUS REVELATION! Carrick-on-Suir, Saturday.— If Mrs. Mary Doheny lived in the "merrie olden times," she would just now be in imminent danger of having her body constituted materials for an *auto-da-fe*. Her achievements in the "black art" have been the theme of horror and wonderment amongst the good folk of Carrick-on-Suir, and a magisterial investigation has but tended to add fuel to the flame of consternation which the announcement of her powers had given existence to. For years past she has lived in affluent circumstances by selling love potions to romantic and foolish girls, while she occasionally netted respectable sums amongst farmers' wives with whom things were not going altogether smoothly. But she surpassed herself when she succeeded in enrolling two steady members of the constabulary force on the list of her votaries, and enmeshing, one of them at least, in debt to a considerable amount in supplying her extraordinary demands upon him. Sub-Constable Joseph Reeves has outlived the first buddings of youthful enthusiasm; he is a married man, of some five and forty years of age, and the father of a family. Some time ago his eldest daughter became ill, and hearing of the curative powers of Mrs. Doheny, his wife engaged ber services and the child improved somewhat. Henceforward, Mrs. Doheny became a frequent guest at the tea-table of the constable, and time she predicted that ere long he would be in affluent circumstances, inasmuch as some of his relatives and connections who had been dead for years had come to life, and would soon be permitted to show themselves upon the earth. He was also led to believe that Sir James Power, who died some ten years ago, took a deep interest in his well-being, and purposed giving him some landed property, and the result was that a correspondence was carried on between them, and the constable received no less than twenty-five letters and a gold ring from the occupant of the grave, the missives in question being regularly forwarded by Mrs. Doheny, and the replies occasionally came through her, and were sometimes found in an old moat on the hiil-side. To attest her powers still further, she made an assignation with the constable to meet him in a certain field at a particular hour, and there she revealed to him the person of his father-in-law, William Mullins, standing at a few yards' distance, dressed in a blue coat with brass buttons, a knee breeches, coarse stockings and shoes; he was not allowed to address the vision, which was beheld by his son, a boy about nine years of age, at the same time. She also showed him others of his friends, &c., who had been dead; amongst others, his son William, who departed this life some five or six years ago. This the constable deposed to on oath before the magistrates on Saturday, and as regarded her power in this respect, he was corroborated on oath by his wife. Mr. Hanna, who, with Messrs. Jephson and Wilson, presided, asked him if he had been drinking at the time, and the man replied that he had not tasted spirituous liquors for the past twenty-two years. This appears strange, to be sure, but then there is further testimony. Sub-constable Hayes is brought forward, and he deposes on oath that the woman has brought up before him several of his friends and connections who had been dead for years, and in this statement he is also corroborated by his wife. For weeks after, Mrs. Doheny is supplied with meal, for the sustenance of the potatoes, tea, &c. &c., for the sustenance of the dead who have come to life, and on more than one occasion, some tobacco was sent to old Mullens, who, it appears, was in his lifetime a great smoker. To meet these demands Constable Reeves got into debt, but the promise of gold and landed property induced him to resort to extensive credits to furnish supplies. New potatoes were at one time returned to him, with a request from the dead that they should be exchanged for old, and on one occasion some eggs were sent back with word that they had not agreed with the dead son William. Mr. Heard, the energetic and most intelligent sub-inspector, at length got intelligence of what was going on, and he determined to make inquiries in reference thereto; Reeves was removed to Clonmel in conseqnence of the debts he had contracted, and learning the cause thereof, he proceeded to Mrs. Doheny's house, where he found the letters (twenty five), from Sir James Power, which she had when the thing got noised abroad. He also got three bottles containing tea, cream, and milk, made up in a clean white handkerchief, and which Mrs. Doheny acknowledged were to have been forwarded to some of her defunct clients on the same evening. The house was otherwise comfortably furnished, and the dame appeared to live well on the credulity of the people. She was, of course, arrested, and the present proceedings were instituted. It was a strange thing to witness in a public court of justice—a number of intelligent people apparently in their senses deposing to such things on oath in the presene of magistrates. Whatever spell she may have wrought, there is no question of doubt but that the policemen named and their families still place implicit faith in her, for when being removed to the dock, Reeves shook her by the hand, and asserted such, and in reply to one of the magistrates, said, "Sir, if you had seen as much as I have you would be of the same opinion." After taking down in writing Reeves' evidence, and he having signed same, the magistrates were about to adjourn when Mr. Wilson, addressing Doheny, said, "Have you anything to say, now that you have heard this statement?" The woman coolly replied, "He wanted te see his dead relatives, and, dead or alive, or on horseback, I showed them to him. Mr. Heard had the woman's husband —a blind (?) man—arrested on Friday evening. He travels through the country led along by a "dark" guide, and on heing questioned he acknowledged that his worst day's receipts for some time past was 2s. 9 1/2d., while occasionally they realized six or seven shilllngs in a day. We learned that some time ago the female prisoner gave a neighbouring woman an awful beating, and yet nobody could be got to prosecute her, fearing that she might bewitch themselves or their children. So stand the and the case at present, Mrs. Doheny is remanded, and the investigation stands adjourned until Monday. The prisoner is apparently about 40 years of age, with a good-looking face, though somewhat *passe*, and a mouth particularly expressive of cunning and intelligence.

On yesterday the magistrates decided upon having a full investigation of the charges preferred against Mrs. Doheny at the petty sessions on Thursday. Mr. Heard, S.I., has unravelled some of the dame's mysteries since Saturday, and has found out the *dead* letter office. *Tipperary Free Press.*

A STRANGE CASE OF WITCHERY IN TIPPERARY.

It would appear from recent revelations in Carrick-on-Suir that witchery has not been exorcised there. A remarkable case of its power to unseat rationality has just been brought under the judicial cognisance of the local magistracy, through the energy of Mr. Heard, S.I, and the police. No fewer than seven individuals, two of them members of the Constabulary force of the conntry—are found to be completely subject to the "black art." But we cannot wonder that even the matter-of fact community of our Irish police are not proof against the power of a village enchantress, when modern revelations have shown that no circle has been found too distinguished—no society too learned or too literary— to be drawn within the *spiritual* influence of the world-renowned home, or of the possessor of the famous "Crystal Bull," even in the heart of London, and in this the nineteenth century. Some fourteen months ago, a woman named Mary Doheny, the wife of a blind man, appeared in the town of Carrick-on-Suir, professing to be able to reveal to the living the forms of those supposed to be long ago dead, and among her dupes were two policemen, who, strange to say, implicitly believed in her power, and scrupulously obeyed her behests, It is stated that she has "drugged" her victims, but, be this as it may, they are now entirely under her influence, and have been so completely so, that she had but to command the most ridiculous services, for obedience to follow. The sub-inspector deemed it necessary, from what transpired, to place the woman under arrest, and to obtain the sworn informations of her constabulary dupes. One man, Hayes, a sub-constable, resigned, being convinced, it is stated, that he is shortly to come in for an extensive estate in the neighborhood of Carrick. The other policeman, Reeves, is a married man, and lived with his wife and family out of barracks. These were the partics who, through the activity of Mr. Heard, and we should also mention of Constable Prendergast, were brought before the resident magistrate, Mr. Hanna, Mr. Briscoe, J.P., Mr. Jephson, J.P., and Mr. Wilson, J.P., to detail what they knew of the case. As there was, on Thursday last, but a preliminary examination, we will not enter ctupon any lengthened detail of the three hours' investigation which then took place, but will merely give a general outline of what transpired upon oath, The woman Doheny obtained admission into Reeves's family circle nearly twelve months ago, under the pretence that she could cure a little child who was then dying. She gave it herbs; but despite her skill, the little one died, and, strange to say, from that moment, such was the confidence she had won, she lived almost constantly at Reeves's house, ing, drinking, and "bewitching" poor Mrs. Reeves, until the latter, who before had been a fine handsome looking woman, grew pale and emaciated, with peculiarly lustrous but sunken eyes, plainly indicating the infatuation she was under, and in which her husband also shared. It would seem that Mrs. Reeves's father, Wm. Mullins, was buried some years ago, and at a later period, another relative, nemed Tom Sheelham, of Mothill, also died; and Mary Doheny asked her would she wish to see those persons and her own child. Mrs. Reeves said she would, and, accordingly, about two months ago, the old woman brought her and her husband to an unoccupied house near the railway bridge, and at twelve o'clock at night— this they have actually sworn — showed them the three persons *alive*, whom they supposed to be dead. Ever since, with extreme regularity, Reeves and his wife have prepared food, and sent their niece with it to Mrs. Doheny, for the use of their relatives and child who had "come to life." To show the extremity of this infatuation, we will give an extract from the sworn testimony of one of the principal witnesses against the prisoner Doheny, whom the crown is prosecuting:—

Mr. Hanna (to Mrs. Reeves)— What is your name? Mullins is my maiden name, but Reeves by marriage.

Is your father dead? He died about three years ago, and was buried in Carrick-on-Suir, but he is now living in Carrick-on-Suir!

Living! How can you say that? Because I saw him!

Under what circumstances? I had a whisper from him; his voice was heard by night, and afterwards Mrs. Doheny (the prisoner) brought me and showed him to me. She also showed me Tom Sheehan, who was lame, and my own child. They were all alive (sensation in court). I sent them food regularly, and upon one occasion I sent my father my chemise to serve as a shirt for him! (This witness gave her evidence in a clear, collected, and positive manner).

Constable Reeves, a man of about forty-five years of age, was next called, and he swore that he, too, saw the two persons and his little daughter, whom he believed to be dead. There was no doubt whatever upon his mind; there they were where the prisoner pointed them out, and, more than this, she had brought him to a field near the moat of Ballydine, and showed him William Mullins, with whom he had been well acquainted!

The niece was called — a fine intelligent girl she appeared to be — and in a clear voice and unhesitatingly she answered the questions put to her by the magistrates. Having been sworn, she said that every night after dark, she brought tea, milk, bread, and butter and other food, and gave them to her uncle, Tom Sheehan, who she always saw standing under the wall of the old house. The magistrates interrogated her closely, but she persisted in swearing that it was to Tom Sheehan and no one else she gave the food.

Hayes, the retired policeman, came forward, and as positively deposed on oath that he knew some of his own relatives brought to life. Prisoner showed Mullins to him. He believed in ghosts, "For," said he, "I saw one in the County Cork, standing outside the door where a cousin of mine was 'waking.' It is not so extraordinary," he added, "for persons to be raised from the dead."

It is marvellous that in this enlightened age a scene such as we are describing could he found to occur in a court of justice. The magistrates and a crowded audience were positively astounded, and from the remarks which were heard to proceed from several persons—some well dressed and apparently in comfortable circumstances in life—and also from the awe which was written upon the countenances of a still greater number, it appears that many beside the "bewitched" family believe in the supernatural power of the prisoner—this modern Witch of Endor! Mr. Heard, we should have mentioned, brought into court the prisoner's box, found in her house, and it contained three bags filled with letters. Some of these she said she had received from the other world, and her father (who never could write), and some from Captain James Power, of Ballydine, who died some years ago; Captain Power she believed to be really dead. Those letters promised her husband money and a large quantity of land. One of them, from Captain Power, contained a *gold* ring (produced in court). Those letters were sent to Mrs. Doheny, according to arrangement, after being read! This accounts for their being found in the prisoner's box. The prisoner was remanded until to-morrow, when the case will, it is expected, be finally heard so far as the magistrates are concerned. Before the old woman left the dock to be conducted back to prison Constable Reeves advanced towards her and, grasping her by the hand, said, "Never mind, Mary, no matter what they say, I believe what you told me and what I have seen."

Mr Heard, anxious to sift this case to the utmost, with a view to obtain, if possible, evidence sufficient to bring the prisoner to trial—for witchcraft cannot now-a-days be summarily disposed of — is exerting all his ingenuity to secure fresh evidence for the adjourned investigation to-morrow, and some very material facts he has since elicited. It is stated that a very respectable and wealthy farmer, the wife of a shopkeeper, and a milk-woman, are among the infatuated. This case has naturally excited extraordinary interest, and a densely crowded court is expected on Thursday. The most remarkabie part of the story remains to he added. This Constable Reeves may now be seen in the streets of Clonmel — whither he has been transferred‚ walking about with his baton under his arm as one of the preservers of the public peace!!

Reeves, we should observe, is upon every way, except this strange hallucination excedingly collected and sensible, but here reason seems quite unseated. The woman Doheny made up draughts for himself and family, and certainly, since partaking of those potations, they have become more and more infatuated.

We have just received copies of the sworn informations in this extraordinary case. The evidence seems to be sufficiently complete to warrant the committal of the prisoner for trial, and we learn that still further disclosures have been brought to light, through the energy of the constabulary. Mrs. Doheny is also a cow doctress, and during the dry Summer reaped quite a golden harvest of "consolation fees" for miles around. The farmers came, it is said, to her for herbs and charms, to bring back a full supply of milk to their stock. One dairywomen gave her it is asserted, no less than £5, and this liberality she thinks was the means of bringing the rain. This woman, says our correspondent, has duped so many persons, that the Rev. Mr. Power, C.C., convened a of the rnral population, against allowing strangers into their houses or families:

2d September, 1864—Mary Reeves sworn—1864. The defendant, Mrs. Doheny, attended my child when it was sick. She made up bottles for it. The child was not getting better. My father died some years ago—three years ago — and was buried in Rathcormack. His name was William Mullins, of Ross, County Wexford. I saw him in my house in Carrick-on-Suir about two months ago, at about twelve at night. A few nights before that he spoke to me, and said he would return home to me and let me know more. After he appeared to me I sent him a shirt by the defendant, Mrs. Doheny. I also sent hima pair of stockings and food, bread and tea, about forty times. I sent all the things to my father by defendant, Mrs. Doheny. My husband was not present when I sent those things. I told him I had done so. I sent tea and new milk boiled to my father, my child, and my other sisters, who are now all in life in human form. Mary Doheny told me that my sisters and child are alive. About four months ago she told me so. My husband was present and heard her. She also said that when they came they would bring their living with them—that they would bring gold, and that they would have a quantity of land—Dr. Purcell's William Power's, and a great many other poople's. (Signed) MARY REEVES

Mrs. Reeves re-examined—The shirt I sent to my father was made of a night dress of my own. It was my own night dress we altered. It was pierced on the elbow. It had a collar and edging. it myself. My mother spun and knitted the stockings herself. They were long stockings, and woollen; grey woolled. My father sent me the letters now produced, and I gave them to defendant to give back to my father.

2d September, Anastatia Power sworn —I am niece to Mrs. Reeves. She sent me last night, the 1st September, 1864, to a house near the corner of the Green, Carrick-on-Suir, to her father, William Mullins, with bread, butter, and tea. I gave those things to Tom Sheehan. On the night before that I also brought provisions, and gave them to Tom Sheehan at the same place.

James Hayes—Mrs. Doheny pointed out to me Tom Sheehan—who I heard died some years ago— some night last week, leaning on a wall at Duggan's field. I saw Mrs. Mullin and Terence Reeves, as known to me by description given me by Mrs. Reeves. Mrs. Doheny told me the family of Reeves would get property. Defendant told me that I would get land. I heard that William Mullins and Terence Reeves died, and I do believe that I have seen those persons since they died, but I can't say whether they were dead or alive when I did see them. I have seen the ghost of my cousin Crowly many years ago.

3rd September, 1864.—Joseph Reeves—I first became acquainted with the defendant twelve months ago, when she attended my child. She rendered the child great benefit. My father-in-law, William Mullins, died in my house in Carrick-on-Suir last May three years. About three months ago defendant told me to go with her, and that she would show me my father-in-law. I went with her to Green-hill, near Mr. Pierce Power's place. In Michael Gaul's grass field I saw my father-in-law standing in the field. He was within twenty yards of me. I did not speak. I am not sure whether defendant prevented me or not. My son Wm., aged about seven years, died on the 13th April, 1860. About two months ago defendant told me to go to William Duggan's waste house and that I would see him. I did go, with my son Terence, eight years of age. I saw my child William, who died and was buried, standing inside the window. Margaret Power was standing with the child William. She was my sister-in-law, and died about seven years ago. I did not speak to either of them. Mrs. Doheny, the defendant, told me I would see them on a certain night she named. My wife sent bread, butter, tea, meat, and a few potatoes to her father, son, and sister. She gave them into defendant's hands with my consent and approval. Defendant asked my wife to send food. She asked in my presence for the food, and as it was after I had seen William Mullins I consented. It was also after I had seen the son and sister-in-law alive. I received letters from defendant's hand. She said Captain James Power, of Ballydine, wrote the letters, telling me that I would get money and land. Captain James Power died about eight or nine years ago. My belief is that the letters were written in the other world. Defendant told me she got the letters from Captain Power. On one occasion defendant told me to write to Captain Power and send the letter to the moat in Ballydine. I did write, and sent the letter by my child, Terence, and got the answer back. Defendant promised me within the last three months that I would get land in the County Waterford. She said that I should get money. Defendant told me when my relations returned that they would bring gold. Defendant brought me a gold ring from some one that had died. A letter from Captain Power directed me to keep the ring and say nothing about it. Defendant brought back some potatoes, and said that the dead would not use them and to send more, and others were sent. She got tobacco for William Mullins to smoke. I went with my son Terence to within a hundred yards of the moat in Ballydine (four miles from Carrick-on-Suir). Defendant was with us. She told me to stop, and she and my son went forward to the moat, and some time after she called me. The son then told me he had a letter for me, and we returned home. When we came home my son gave me the letter. I have been sending food every day to those that died for about the last six weeks. On several occasions defendant brought back the food and said they did not like it. On one occasion she said the eggs were bad and that my son William would not use them as they took an effect on him. A shirt, trousers, and stockings were sent to my son. I saw my wife giving the trousers to defendant.

CASE OF WITCHCRAFT. (FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDEMNT.)

Carricn-on-Suir, Thursday.— The usual fortnightly petty sessions was held today, before Samuel Hanna, R M, chairman, The Right Hon. the Earl of Busborough, Carberry Scully, T B Wilson, W D Despard, and T Lalor, D L.

THe following gentlemen occupied seats on the bench:— Dr Purcell, medical inspector, Dr Ryan, Rev Mr Ridgeway, Mr O'Donnell, chairman of the Town Commissioners, Mr R Fehon, and Mt John Bushe, son of the late Chief Justice Bushe.

The court house, a small building in that part of the town called Carrickmore, was densely crowded, in consequence of the investigation into the charges preferred against the woman, Mary Doheny, who was placed fa the dock for obtaining money under falee pretences.

She was represented by Mr Vowell.

The first witness called was Sub-Constable Reeves, who deposed that he was a member of the police force, and had been stationed in Carrick-on-Suir, where he became acquainted with the prisoner at the bar about fifteen months ago, when she came to treat a child of his who was suffering from fits. He knew William Mullins, his wife's father, who is dead for the past three years; he was aware of the fact from seeing his corpse at his own house, and seeing it taken away for interment at Rathcormack; he was told by the defendant Doheny that Mullins had come to life, and she asked him to come with her to Knockroe; he went before her, accompanied by his son; she was coming up to where they were standing, and, pointing in a particular direction, asked him if he saw anything; he said yes, he saw his father-in law, who was standing at about twenty yards' distance (great laughter); he was not frightened; he thought the case a rare and a curious one to come before a court of justice; he was acquainted with his father-in-law for sixteen years; at the time he saw him he was standing in the field with a stick in his hand; it was daylight when they went to the field, about eight o'clock in the evening; he did not speak to his father-in-law; he believed that he had now come to life; within the last four months food was sent to him, consisting of bread, batter, and tea, once in the twenty-four hours; never gave any clothing, either by Doheny or his wife's niece, but he believed some had been sent by his wife; on one occasion Doheny got a penny from him for tobacco for old Mullins (laughter); Doheny told him not to speak to the vision which he beheld; was satisfied that it was his father-in-law; his son William died in April, 1862; he was then about nine years of age; saw him about three months ago in a waste building belonging to a man named Duggan, opposite Mr Jepson's gate; Doheny told him to go there and that he would see some person' saw his sister-in-law, Margaret Power, standing next to the window in Duggan's house; she is dead; did not speak to her; got some letters by his son Terence and one also by Mrs. Duggan; his son is eight years of age; the letters he alluded to came from Captain James Power, who died ten years ago; never saw Captain Power, but believed he is in the other world; old Muillins had been in Captain Power's employment and the Captain was very fond of him; was told that Captain James is at present in the moat at Ballydile; walked in at Ballydile; went with his son to the moat; walked in before him and remained for about a quarter of an hour; had given him a letter addressed to Captain James Power; when his son came back from the moat he told him that he had a reply for him; the reply was folded in clean linen handkerchief; his son had it in his bosom, but said that he could not give it to him until they got back to the house; when he returned he handed him a letter; could not say if the letter produced in court is the same, as none of the letters had been dated; had been told or promised that he would get land in the County Waterford: but the particular locality was not mentioned; in one of the letters from Captain James Power he got a ring, which he believed to have been gold; hadn't it about him, but believed is was in his wife's possession; she never wore the ring; some of the food sent for the sustenance of the departed was returned, new potatoes being exchanged for old ones; at one time some eggs that he sent to his little boy were sent back as they were too strong for him.

When cross-examined by Mr Vowell, the witness reiterated the statement that he saw his father-in-law in the field, at Knockroe, and that he was quite satisifed he was alive or coming to life; he saw his sister-in-law, Margaret Power, and his deceased son standing at the window of Duggan's house, but did not address them; he went near the window, and observed that his son had grown considerably; he wore the same clothes, but they did not appear to be worn out.

Mr. Vowell— Do you men to say he wore the same clothes that he died in? 

Witness— He did.

Mr. Vowell— Why, did he die with his clothes on?

Mrs. Reeves—Lord help us! he did, he did.

Witness— Yes, he died in his chair; he was then only about seven years of age; when I saw him at the window, I thought he looked pale and sickly, but he was always a delicate child; I am sure Captain Power is not alive, but I believe he is in the moat; at Ballydile I believe my people in-law are with the "gentry," or, as we commonly call them, "the good people". I expect to get gold from them when they return to life; my son is dead three or four years; Margaret Power died seven years ago; she was dressed also; she did not speak to me; I was looking at her for full ten minutes; I believe she was alive at the time of her appearance; my son did not ask me to come with him.

Mrs. Reeves, wife of Constable Reeves, deposed that Mrs Doheny first came to her in reference to the curing of her child, who was suffering from fits; the father, she said, who died about three years ago, appeared to her at twelve o'clock at night in her own house, but she did not speak to him. He led her to believe that he would could to her again in perfection; she was in bed at the time, but not asleep; told the circumstance as is occurred, in the morning; did not speak to Mrs. Doheny in reference to any matter but the illness ot her child up to that period; when she became aware that her father was in life, she sent him a night dress and a pair of stockings; she also sent him some food through Mrs. Doheny, which consisted of bread, tea and new milk; the tea was not liked at first; heard her three sisters speaking to him; their names were Margaret, who died seven years ago, Ellen, who died eleven years ago, and Bridget, who died three and a half years ago; these were speaking to him at her door; it was at her suggestion that the food was sent; she merely asked Mrs Doheny what quality of food she should send, and she told her bread, butter, and such like.

To Mr. Wilson—I never got drinks or doses of any description from the defendent; she gave me some herbs in mil for my child; I never gave her a shilling for the dead people; never paid her for curing my child or attempting to cure her; the only money I ever gave her was a penny; I got several letters through my son, by Mrs Doheny, and by my niece; I kept the letters until last Wednesday week, when Mrs Doheny came to me and said they were required back by the family, but that she wou!d return them to me again at a proper time; she told me my sister was alive; at one time she said my son was too delicate to eat the new potatoes and eggs which hed been sent; I changed the diet next, and sent some tea; after a fortnight a quantity of tea was returned, to be replaced by fresh tea; she believed everything she was saying to be the truth; she also was shown Tom Sheehan, who when in the flesh had been a friend of her husband's.

Cross-examined by Mr. Vowell—Captain Power wrote the letters for my father who, did not know how to write himself. Captain Power is in the moate at Ballydile. Tom Sheehan gave the first letter that we got to my son. He died some time ago. Mrs. Doheny was present when my son brought the letter into the house. I did not open it, but I said—"Who can this letter be from?" Mrs. Doheny remarked that it must be from Captain James Power, because he was in the moate at Ballydile. I heard my sister Margaret speaking to me three times. I did not answer her. It was about nine o'clock at night. I believe she was then with the "gentry," or "good people." She is living with them now fm their own state. I knew my sister's voice. My son was talking to me for three quarters of an hour. I did not believe he was on earth as an earthly person, but that he was one of the "good people" or "gentry." I cannot tell why I did not ask him to come in. I believe my father is living now, and when the proper time comes round that he will come back to me.

James Hayes was sworn, and deposed that he had been a policeman, and was stationed in Carrick-on-Suir; he left the police force about two months ago, as he had become embarrassed, thinking he could pay his debts better by working at his trade; knows Mrs. Doheny, to whom he often gave charity; had heard of Tom Sheehan and and William Mullins, but did not know them personally; from the description he got of the former, he believes he saw him standing on a wall near Duggan's house (here the witness decribed very accurately the particular pose of the ghostly visitant); did know `[sic]` William Mullins or William Reeves, except according to the description given him by Mrs Doheny; went out to a field at the rere of the courthouse towards the railway, accompanied by Reeves and Mrs Doheny some months ago; could not say if Reeves or Doheny pointed out the direction to him, but whichever them directed his attention to it, he certainly saw the figure of a man in the field; he believed that man to have been William Mullins, but could only conjecture so from the description he got; gave Mrs Doheny food on more than one occasion; she never directly promised him that he would get land; believed he said something to that effect in his examination on Friday last, but it was a mistake; heard her alluding to the fact that Reeves would come in for land, and thinks she intimated that he would also.

To Mr, Heard, sub-inspector—I never got a bottle of medicine from the defendant; I never gave her a shilling for a bottle of any particular stuff; I made a copy of the letter produced at the request of Mary Doheny and Mrs Reeves; the original I believe was sent to Captain Power, and signed by sub-constable Reeves.

The letter alluded to was read by Hayes, but it was a perfectly unconnected fumble of mere nonsense.

On being cross-examined by Mr. Vowell—Hayes said that he considered he was clear in his senses, and that if he was ever "hesy" he was not aware of the fact; he saw a ghost before; it was that of a frined of his named Crowly, who resided in the county Cork; saw Sheehan, or a person whom he believed to have been Sheehan from a description he got of him, between the hours of 8 and 10 o'clock; he did not think that too early for a ghost to come out (great laughter); it was at 11 o'clock at night that he saw Crowly.

The informations of a young woman named Ellen Walsh were read to her, by which it appeared that she wrote the letters which were handed into court, and which letters purported to be from Captain Power and other deceased friends. She got fourpence a piece for the long letters, and twopence and threepence for the short ones.

Miss Doran, on being sworn, deposed that the woman Doheny came into her house and asked her sister to write a letter for her; her sister being busy, when she (Mrs Doheny) asked her to write it, which she did, not knowing for what or for whom it was intended.

Only a limited number of the witnesses were called, and Mr. Vowell briefly addressed the Bench for the prisoner. He described the whole thing from beginning to end as a wretched farce, which he was quite sure would not admit of reproduction, and in which he wished the curtain should fall immediately. He thought there was not a particle of evidence to prove that the woman had obtained the food and money under false pretences, they having been voluntarily tendered by the parties themselves, and on these grounds he would ask their worships to deal with the case summarily.

The magistrates, however, were unanimous in sending her for trial before the Chairman of the Quarter Sessions, at Clonmel, next month.

The prisoner, who listened attentively to the evidence adduced, fainted several times before the proceedings were brought to a close, and had to be removed from the dock by the constables. She had an infant in her arms. This evening she was brought up from Carrick, and safely lodged in *durance vile* in Clonmel gaol, where she will await her trial.

Carrick-on-Suir, Friday.— Sub-constable Reeves and ex-Constable Hayes, together with Mrs Reeves and the other parties still continue to their firm belief in all that the *soi disant* Mrs Mary Doheny, has either said or done during her intimacy with them. The prisoner is a low sized, small-featured, cunning-looking woman, and appears perfectly competent to dupe a dozen such confiding mortals as those she has had dealings with. The Captain Power whose name figures so prominently in the several depositions made before the magistrates is, or rather was when *in carne*, the grandfather or granduncle (we are not quite certain which) of the present Edward de la Poer, Esq, D L, of Gurteen. Mrs Doheny told Mr Jepson, one of the presiding justices at the first investigation, that she would raise the spirit of his deceased father if he would permit her; but Mr Jepson declined the pleasure of an interview under such circamstances. The Rev. Mr Power, one of the local clergymen, endeavoured to persuade the woman to abandon her foolish practices, but without avail. She offered him a small bottle containing some liquid to drink out of it, assuring him that if he drank some of it he would know just as much as Reeves! The moate alluded to in the evidence brought forwarded, appears to have been a sort of 'general post office' for the transmission of letters between the living and the dead, or rather to speak technically, the "gentry," or good people, who are not believed to be absolutely defunct, but inhabiting a sort of middle sphere. There was a kind of underground passage in this moate, tunnelled through the earth, and having openings at both ends. The letters addressed by Sub-constable Reeves and others, to the departed were shoved in at one end of this tunnel (we will call it, so far want of a better name), and the replies were produced in due time at the other end, Mrs D. acting as post mistress, extraordinary, sometimes delivering the answers in person to Reeves and co., at other times sending them by Reeves' young son. The whole affair forms the subject of extensive discussion in the neighbourhood of Carrick and Clonmel.

"WITCHCRAFT" AND ITS CONSEQUENCES

Extraordinary Scene In A Petty Sessions Court.

*(From our Special Reporter.)*

Carrick-on-Suir, Thursday.

The second part of this extraordinary drama was enacted in the petty sessions court-house at Carrick-on-Suir on this day, and it would seem that the public interest it excited at the outset has been gaining additional strength every day. At present, the story of the Enchantress and the bewitehed Policeman forms the chief topic of local gossip, and is discussed in the highest circles. The court-house, for hours before the arrival of the magistrates, was besieged by an immense throng of persons. The doors were kept closed until near the hour for opening the court. When they were unlocked, the rush of people inside was such that in a few minutes the gallery, the jurors' boxes, the hall, even the bench itself was thronged to suffocation. Magistrates and other gentlemen came from long distances to listen to this marvellous case, some—it must be confessed—impelled by curiosity to see the reputed "witch" herself! At eleven o'clock the court was formally opened. On the bench were the following—Samuel Hanna, Esq., R.M., presiding; the Right Hon. the Earl of Besborough, Thomas Lalor, Esq., D.L.; Thomas B. Wilson, Esq., J.P.; Carbry Scully, Esq., J.P., Wm. Despard, Esq., J.P., C. Sadleir, Esq., J.P. There were also, W. H. Hemsworth, Esq., County Inspector; A. W. H. Heard, Esq., S.I.; Dr. Purcell, P.L.I.; Mr. MacDonnell, Captain Purcell, L.I.V.; Dr. O'Ryan, J. M. Melville, Esq., John Bushe, Esq., Dublin, and several other gentlemen.

Mary Doheny, the prisoner, was placed in the dock. She wore, wrapped around her, a red shawl, and had in her arms an infant only a few months old. "There lave me alone, jintlemen, and never fear I'll go in quietly" she said, as the police were about to shove her into the grated enclosure as quickly as possible, as if they were afraid she would slip through their fingers, and vanish from their sight. But no, there she stood facing the crowd just like an ordinary mortal in a similar predicament. Strange that she, who professed to have the power of summoning spirits from the vasty deep, dragging them forth from their distant tombs, could be kept by a few planks of timber of one inch thickness.

Beside the witness table were seated the several persons who were said to be, and according to their own sworn testimony, have actually been under the bewitching influence of the prisoner, Mary Doheny. They presented a melancholy spectacle, and certainly no one can read the evidence we subjoin without becoming assured of the mischief which infatuation had already wrought. There were some features in the case excessively ludicrous. It was something very novel, indeed almost incredible, to find a police constable, a man of 22 years' service, who had lived through the callous matter-of-fact atmosphere of a barrack life, accustomed to look at things not as they seemed, and to reason with sagacious ingenuity—to find such a man confidentially informing the court of his interviews with relations restored to life, and of his visits to the dead-letter office in the Moate of Ballydine, where he dispatched letters to Captain James Power, and received replies from the other world. Well, Sub-Constable Joseph Reeves, his wife, his niece, his child, his friend Hayes (the ex-policeman), —bewitched as they all have been—are not, after all, objects of such wonderment. Home has moved amongst the Courtly, and one Imperial ear has listened to his messages from the other world. Aye, Rome itself thought it prudent—dreading, we suppose, *his* power—to politely, but still firmly, intimate its desire for his departure. Biology and Clairvoyance have had their successful run of mystery through the most learned circles; and even in Santiago has not a parallel been found for the establishment of a direct communication with the other world. We are, however, digressing from the proceedings connected with the trial.

Joseph Reeves, who was dressed in the ordinary uniform of the force, was, on being sworn, examined by Mr. Hanna, R.M. You are a sub-constable of police? Yes. Do you know the defendant, Mrs. Doheny? I do, your worship, that is she in the dock. How did you first become acquainted with her? About 18 months ago she began attending my child; I am not aware of the nature of her illness, but she was subject to fits, and used not to sleep before Mary Doheny gave her the medicine; now she is able to get some rest; the bottle which she took must, therefore, have done her good.

Do you know William Mullins? Yes; he is my wife's father; in May last three years he died in my house, and I buried him in Rathgormack; my wife attended the funeral; I did not; I saw him, however, lying dead, and conveyed out of the house.

Do you know anything of him now? I am told he came to life again.

Who told you that? Well she asked me——

Who is "she"? The prisoner, sir; she asked me and my son to go with her up to Knockroe; we went, and remained there ten minutes; she then asked me to look in some direction; I did so, and pointing down the field she asked me did I see anything; I said I see my father-in-law, William Mullins.

Now, do you really believe you saw him?—I do believe I saw him, for he was no more than twenty yards from me.

Were you frightened (laughter) when you saw the dead man rising?—I was not—(renewed laughter), in which the constable himself joined, adding—It is such a rare case to come before a court that it is no wonder people laugh; but, your worship, there are instances of the like occurring. Other people who died have come to life, but not to my own personal knowledge.

Perhaps you were deceived in this instance. How is it you are so sure that it was William Mullins you saw? I knew him, sir. I knew him well, and have been acquainted with him for about fifteen or sixteen years while he was first alive.

What became of the man—where did the apparition go to?

Mr. Vowell (who appeared for the prisoner's husband)—The man, your worship, not the apparition! (laughter).

Witness—I left him standing on the field; he had a stick in his hand.

What hour was this? It was about eight o'clock in the evening, and perfect daylight.

Did you ever send him anything since he died?—Not since he died, for the man is alive! I only heard that he died.

Are you not perfectly sure that Wm. Mullins died and was buried? I am.

Did you send him any food since you went to Knockroe? I did; about three or four months ago I sent him bread, butter, and tea?

Well, did he eat them? I can't swear to anything I didn't see, and I was not to the fore, when the food was given to him.

How often did you send the food? Once in the twenty-four hours regularly. It was sent by the woman in the dock, and by my wife's niece. I believe there was a pair of stockings sent to my people-in-law, and I gave her a penny for tobacco for Wm. Mullins (laughter).

Did anything ever happen about the potatoes?—They came back once; Mary Doheny said that neither my father-in-law nor my three sisters-in-law (who also died), nor my son (who died when he was seven years of age), could partake of them. My son William died in April, and I saw him in the waste house belonging to Mr. Duggan, and opposite Mr. Jephson's, the magistrate.

Who told you he had come to life?—Mrs. Doheny told me to go to this place and see whether I would find anyone there. I went and saw my son standing with one of my sisters-in-law, who died seven years ago, but is now alive. They came to the window, but I did not speak to them; I received some letters from my son, Terence Reeves, who is in court, and about eight years of age; they were from William Mullins, but I consider it was Captain James Power who wrote them; he died about ten years ago; the poor captain was very fond entirely of my father-in-law (laughter).

What world is Captain Power in? If he is not on this world he must be in the other world; I could not say whether *he* was ever seen alive on this earth after being buried; I was told to write to Capt. James, and when I wrote I brought the letter, accompanied by my son, and this woman, [Mary Doheny], in the direction of Ballydine moat; this little chap of mine went up to the moat, and came back in about ten minutes, and asked me for the letter I had; I gave it to him, and I saw him going into the fort, and coming out in about a quarter of an hour; he called me to come towards him, for I was at a little distance from the moat, and I did so; I asked him for the letter, but he said, "no, I can't give it to you until I go home; he had it rolled up in a handkerchief, and inside the breast of his coat; the letter I wrote was written in red ink, and the answer I got back was in black ink; the red letter I wrote upon a *sixpenny* stamped paper. Mrs. Doheny told me such was required; I paid sixpence for a stamp at the post-office, and put it on a sheet of paper; the stamp came back to me out of the moate, but the letter was kept.

Mr. Heard, S.I., here produced a large bundle of letters from *this* to the *other* world, and from the *other* world to *this*—written, some on "pink-edged," "wave-note," and embossed paper. Only one letter, strange to say, was written on *foolscap*! These letters were all found in the prisoner's box, tied up carefully in white cotton bags strung with leather. They had been handed into Mary Doheny's possession at the prisoner's own request. There was an attempt made to decipher some of this correspondence, but the constabulary failed, as it was nothing but the most incoherent nonsense. The following is one of those letters which the witness and his family believe came to them from the deceased, Captain James Power, together with the reply! Our readers surely would not desire to wade through fifty such:—

My dear frend—I am going to give you warning on this Night that you are not to speak to me on the journey. We expect untill you call to the Lodging where the family is for to deliver What We have for you there Both you And the Rest of the friends, and We Cannot mention to you What night of the week is that for that was my orders on this day by Captain James Power. But now I am letting you know all things is right, and we are to go on the old journey to-night on the strength of your sister-in-Law for the Return of Husband and Children, And that is all the delay on you When you shall blame an owner to your own Wishes. Let James know from me that he is not disappointed in What he is Wating for, that according to What i have said to him 'tis at an end now. My dear & kind friend get James Bourk to think on them that was in prison. At our Return he shall convey his friend William Mullins home to his own door, And that before the week is at an end, and not mention the day. My Dear And kind friend Eliza, i am thankful to you for your letter you bestowed on me, for i Receive it with great Rejoicement, and God will be your guide With What we are bestowing on you And on the kind widow, for she never will be forgot. few days in this week will put you to an end to be labouring for others. My dear and kind friend let Pat Fitzpatrick see to this that we are sending him our compliments for the belife he kept, and for what he had done. The exposing of What was said in the publick street at the hour of 10 o'clock took a little on us, When you were present; but thanks be to God We are able to Clear all that."

"Dear James—You were a great Burden on us through the means of a tossation. there were never A disappointment took Place but you were the instagation of it. And what you shall Require to so you shall se it yourself, And the young youth, tery, shall go three nigts to the old ground, And you shall meet me. in your mind you had an envy spite for the loyal And trye friend; but you thought you were a service to joe; but you were not, but a heavy disappointment to him; but Please the Lord i hope it twill be no more. for now we have Pardoned you. This in the 3rd offer the captain said that you disappointed the brave family. And what you done on yesterday was no more service to them while they were sitting, no more than if you did it. What we would not fear Belife it would be no service to us. now i hope you shall not Change no more in your mind, for from us great comfit you shall find in in the next to the chair your friend sat with Captain James. Now your pardon is Returned, hoping you never will be a cross again."

Examination resumed by the court—About this gold which was promised to you? I know nothing about it, but I was told that when my people-in-law would come they'd bring plenty with them; I had a promise of getting a tract of land.

Mr. Vowell—Part of the Marquis of Waterford's estate was it? I don't know but it might be there; the place was not named. [To the court].—Mrs. Doheny brought me a ring, which appears to be gold, and a letter; they were sent to me by Captain James Power, but I was told not to say anything about who they came from.

Where is that ring? My wife has it.

Mr. Vowell—I'll engage she is wearing it? Witness (impressively), no she never wears it, she was told not to do so; I remember, in reference to some eggs that were sent to my sister-in-law and child by Mrs. Doheny, that they objected to use them as they were too strong (laughter).

Mr. Vowell—I'm really sorry, and in sober sadness I say it, to find you in such a plight.

Witness—On what account?

How long have you been in the force? Twenty two years.

I am sorry you are so near leaving it! Well, sir, it will be no loss to the force (laughter).

Why did you not go to shake hands with your son, and your sister-in-law, when you met them in Duggan's? I did not because they were not alive then.

Not alive, did you not see them there? Yes.

Surely you have no doubt on your mind about their having come to life? They are alive now, but they were not then; I cannot say any more about them; my son and people-in-law are there confined in that waste house for three months, but they cannot come out.

Who sent them there?—The man who brought them to the surface, and that man, it is my sworn belief, is Captain James Power; and he will keep them there until the time is cut out for them to leave it.

Do you know where Captain James Power is?—I do; he is in the fort or moat of Ballydine.

How do you know that?—Well, did you not ever hear, sir, that there is a "Gentry" on earth.

Well, I hope there is! (laughter).—Witness: I mean a gentry that you cannot see!

You mean the "Good people"?—Well, call them whatever you like.

Is it to the good people you trust to get the crock of gold?—No; when my people-in-law come back, I am told they will bring gold with them. There are five of them who were buried now alive; of this I have not the slightest doubt.

Mr. Lalor, D.L.—What clothes had your son on when you saw him in Duggan's?—He was dressed in the clothes he always wore when alive.

Surely, he did not die suddenly, with his every-day clothes on?

Mrs. Reeves (from the body of the court)—He did! he did!

Witness—My wife will tell you; I know he died sitting in a chair by the kitchen fire. He was seven years of age when he died, and that is seven years ago. When I saw him he appeared to me to be a great deal taller.

In fact (said Mr. Vowell, resuming the cross-examination), the seven-years-old had become a ten-years-old. From what you say it would appear he was taken good care of where he was?—It appeared to me that he was! (laughter;) but still he had the same puny and delicate look he always wore.

What about the clothes; were they much worn?—They did not appear to have been worn at all.

Or brushed?—They were as well brushed as ever—a poor man's child is not expected to have well brushed clothes; he was bare-headed, the same as I am now. When we went towards the window where they were standing, my little son, Terry, saw him first, and said, "There he is, father—there he is!"

But what about this "Crock of Goold?" Would you take it if you got it?—Witness: I'll engage you would! aye, and close your fist on it, too, if any one were to give you four or five sovereigns; and so would any one.

To be sure they would. Now what about the dress your sister-in-law had on; had she a crinoline on?—No; they were not worn when she died! I was ten minutes looking at them when I came away with my son Terence. The little chap, when he brought the letters to the moat, told me that he used to put them on a shelf, and after a time he would see the hand reaching the answer back.

I am afraid it is the story of the Prodigal Son, "My son that was dead and is alive, was lost and is found," is running in your mind, Reeves?—No, that is quite a different thing.

To the Court—The letters produced have no date, nor are they addressed.

Mr. Vowell—Directions are not necessary upon letters going to the other world (laughter).

Mary Reeves, wife to the last witness, is next called and sworn. After describing how she became acquainted with the prisoner, she continued—Before this William Mullins, my father, came to me one night, he returned alive to the earth, about the hour of 12 o'clock, and said he would come back to this world in perfect form; he came in his own appearance to me in my own house; I was in bed at the time, but I was not asleep; this was about the time the child was curing; I had no conversation with Mrs. Doheny up to that time, but have often had since; I sent my father a night-dress and a pair of stockings; nothing else.

"Nothing else!" did you not send him something to eat? I did, of course! I gave the food to Mrs. Doheny for him; that is the woman standing in the dock; I sent bread, tea, and new milk to my father, my child and my three sisters, all of whom had died; Margaret Mullins died seven years ago, Ellen eleven years, and Bridget two years and a half since; I know they are alive, for I heard their voices, and Mrs. Doheny told me.

[This witness was asked repeatedly the question by Mr. Wilson, J.P.—"Did any one tell you to send the food to your father and sisters?" before she could be made to acknowledge that the prisoner had done so.—At first she stated that she heard a voice at night; again she stated that it came to her at night, and at last she admitted that Mary Doheny told her what food would be required].

The dead people took very little—said witness—at first. Whatever I gave was of my own free will and consent. My father told me to send the food; of course I knew he required it. The woman in the dock gave herbs to my child, but neither myself or my husband got anything from her; I never gave her any money except one penny. I kept all the letters (produced) until Mrs. Doheny told me they were required to go back to the people who sent them; she told me that my sisters were alive, and I believed her; it was mentioned in one of the notes that they would come back and bring their share with them, and I was also told that I was to get land when they would return to earth; Mrs. Doheny told me to send tea, bread, and new milk to them; no later than yesterday my child saw his uncle Tom Sheehan standing with my father, William Mullins.

Cross-examined by Mr. Vowell—I think my father is alive, and to the best of my belief it was Captain James Power who wrote these letters, for I have seen his writing before he died.

Is he dead now? He is, sir; but he is in the moat of Ballydine; his bones were buried in Rathgormack.

Who told you he was there? Mrs. Doheny, and my child got the letters from him there.

To Mr. Wilson—These eleven letters [marked] came, Mrs. Doheny told me, from Captain Power; Tom Sheehan gave the first letter to my son; he died some years ago; Captain Power is not on this earth in the flesh, but he is looking after the rest.

To Mr. Vowell—The Captain is now sitting at the moat, and if he called his hounds together they would come to him; I suppose I heard some of my sisters call me at my own door, "Mary! Mary! Mary!" three times by name; I did not answer; it was moonlight, and I knew they were with *the gentry* then; I have not the slightest doubt that they are alive now; my son William, who died, was talking to me lately at my own door for three quarters of an hour; I did not ask him inside; I would if I could; one of the good people called him away; it was sometime after my husband told me that my father was alive I sent the food to him; I asked Mrs. Doheny what sort of food would be good for them, and she said one cut of bread and butter; I gave it to her.

Witness, to Mr. Wilson—A note was brought to me by my son, telling me to send food to my relatives until their time for appearing would be up; I asked Mrs. Doheny what kind of food I should send, and she told me that at the outset I should not send any drink, and but little food; I sent some frequently by my niece, and a few times by Mrs. Doheny, and anything I sent I gave with my own free will and consent; my father required food; he told me himself that he would come back to me, and I knew he should get something when the Lord God sent him.

Mr. Vowell objected to what he designated a leading question from Mr. Wilson.

Mr. Wilson—I did not lead the witness.

Mr. Vowell—You asked her if Margaret Doheny told her to send the food.

Mr. Wilson—I did not.

Mr. Vowell—You did, sir.

Mr. Wilson—I say I did not.

Mr. Vowell—But I say, and I maintain you did, sir.

Mr. Despard—Mr. Wilson said no such thing, and I think that you, Mr. Vowell, should address the bench in a more respectful manner.

Mr. Vowell—I am not to be taught manners by a person of your description. I won't put up with such gross impertinence.

Mr. Despard—It is you who are grossly impertinent.

Mr. Vowell—It is not because I am a solicitor, and you a magistrate that I am to listen to such observations being addressed to me.

Mr. Hanna, R.M.—If order is not observed I certainly shall leave this place. When you contradict a magistrate you should do it, Mr. Vowell, courteously.

Mr. Vowell—And when a magistrate contradicts me, he also must do it courteously.

Witness, to Mr. Despard—I never got drinks or doses of any kind from the defendant, nor from any one else; she gave herbs to my child, who was foolish; I never gave the woman a shilling for the dead, nor did I ever pay her, nor did she ask payment for attending the child; all the money I ever gave her was one penny; Mrs. Doheny said my sisters and son were too delicate to eat new potatoes and eggs, and I changed the diet next night; some tea was sent back about two weeks ago; I gave fresh tea instead.

James Hayes sworn—I was in the constabulary, and resigned about two months ago; I became embarrassed in town on account of pecuniary difficulties, and the fact came to the knowledge of my officer, to whom some reports were made which grieved me very much; I resigned because I thought I could better pay my debts by working at my trade than if I remained in the force; I know the defendant; I heard of Tom Sheehan, and got a description of him; I was told he was dead; I believe from the description I got of him, that it was he I saw leaning on a wall near Duggan's house; he was pointed out to me by Mrs. Doheny; I did not know William Mullins or William Reeves; according to the description given me of the former by Mrs. Reeves, I saw him or his ghostly appearance; I believe he is dead, and that it was him I saw; I saw him in a field some distance behind this court-house; Reeves and Mrs. Doheny were with me at the time, and I can't say which of them pointed him out; I believe also that I saw Mrs. Reeves' child; it is about fifteen months ago since I first knew Mrs. Doheny; I sometimes gave her small sums in charity, and occasionally some meat and things that would be left after dinner; I never took a penny-worth of medicine in my life from her or any one else, except two pills, and some salts and senna; I gave her a coat and hat for her husband, who is a poor blind man; I very frequently gave charity to other poor people; I never remember that she made me any promises, and I never gave her the money for a special purpose.

Mr. Lalor—Did she promise to do anything for you? I never gave her any money to do anything for me.

Do you believe that you are to get land? I believe nothing till I see it.

Did you not believe that you were to come in for property? I believed it some time ago, but let me explain.

Did any one tell you that you were to get land. [No reply, and question repeated]—I believe Mrs. Doheny did tell me, but I don't undertake to swear it.

Did you ever state to a magistrate that she did? I did on Friday last, but she did not tell me what land I was to get. At one time I heard her say that when those persons of whom Mr. and Mrs. Reeves have spoken would return I was to get some land.

Did you ever give the prisoner more than 6d. in money?—Oh! I did, sir. Mrs. Doheny said the other day that I gave her 2d for a bottle, but I did not. [Witness here read the copy of a letter which was written by Reeves to Captain Power. This copy, the prisoner told him, was required for a person whom he had heard was dead, and whom he understood to be a gentleman named Captain James Power].

Cross-examined by Mr. Vowell—Are you quite clear in your mind now in reference to this matter?—I consider myself that I am.

Was there any haze over your mind when you wrote that letter?—I did not see any, nor did I feel it—(laughter).

You state that you saw William Mullins, a man who has been dead some years; was he alive when you saw him?—I could not say whether he was alive or dead, but my belief is that he was dead—that is he was in his ghostly form—the appearance that men wear after death.

How many ghosts have you ever seen? I never took a note of the number.

Did you see any? I did see one that I considered to be the ghost of a person who had just died—the ghost of a man named Crowley, who was a cousin of my own; it was far away from this; I saw Tom Sheehan's ghostly appearance at between eight and ten o'clock.

Mr. Vowell—That is early for ghosts to be out.

Witness—I don't think it was so; I saw a ghost before at 11 o'clock, p.m.

At this stage of the proceedings the prisoner fell into the arms of one of the Constabulary in a fit, and there was a burst of laughter from the gallery. It was evident that very few in that part of the court believed that she was really sick. The child was taken from the woman's arms, and she was removed outside, where she very quickly recovered and was brought back.

Ellen Walshe, the teacher of a National School, was next called, when the chairman read her informations as follows:—

A. W. H. Heard, complt., Mary Doheny, deft.
Petty Sessions, Carrick-on-Suir.
Co. Tipperary, S.R.

The information of Ellen Walshe, who saith on her oath that a woman who I believe to be Mary Doheny came to my lodgings in Grantown-street, in Carrick-on-Suir, several times, and asked me to write letters for her. I wrote letters often for about the last four months for her; the letters now produced, I wrote for the said Mary Doheny, writing down the words she told me. She asked me to change my handwriting—to write like a man. She paid me 3d for each letter; lately, she paid me 4d, and 2d for the small ones. She refused to tell me who the messages were from or to whom they were going. And the said informant binds herself to attend at Carrick-on-Suir Petty Sessions on the 8th September, 1864, to prosecute Mary Doheny, for said offence, or otherwise to forfeit to the crown the sum of
(Signed)                    Ellen Walsh.

Her supplementary information, sworn on the 6th September, was also read. It was merely identifying the prisoner as the person for whom she wrote the letters now produced in court.

Terence Reeves was next called. He appeared a very intelligent boy, aged between eight and ten years.

Mr. Hanna—Have you learned your catechism?—Yes, sir.

Do you know what an oath is?—No, sir.

Don't you know whether it is right or wrong to take a false oath?—I don't, sir.

Don't you know what would happen to you if you told a lie?—No, sir.

Mr. Lalor—Did any one tell you to say that?—No.

The boy was allowed to retire.

Sub-Constable Reeves—Your worship, the child is only twelve months going to school, and he does not know the nature of his catechism.

A young girl named Doran, the daughter of a respectable shopkeeper, was brought forward to prove that she, too, had written a letter for Mary Doheny. She did not know for whom it was intended, or anything whatsoever about it.

Mr. Vowell, the evidence having been closed, addressed his worship upon the defence, and said he was glad that upon the last scene—so far, at least, as that court was concerned—the curtain had fallen upon as gross a farce as ever was brought before any assembly. In rising to address them, he was baffled to know what language he should address to them; and first, he would ask, what was the charge preferred against the woman in the dock?

Chairman—That of receiving property under false pretences.

Mr. Vowell denied that one single sentence that had fallen from any of the witnesses was calculated to prove that the prisoner was guilty of such a crime. The evidence which had been given merely showed that those persons of their own free will, and not from any misrepresentation on the part of the defendant, had given the food and other articles. Those people had been labouring under the strangest delusions, and was their evidence of such a character as could be relied upon in any court of justice?—assuredly not. He was quite sure their worships would not send such a farcical case before the higher tribunals of the country. After some further observations, Mr. Vowell left the case in the hands of the bench, observing, in conclusion, that he regretted that any little ebullition of feeling should have occurred in the course of the trial, and which arose from some misunderstanding.

Chairman— The bench are unanimous in thinking that this case should be sent to quarter sessions for firther investigation.

The prisoner was removed in custody, and in the course of the evening transferred to Clonmel gaol.

WITCHORAFT IN TIPPERARY. A case of this description came before the magistrates sitting on Thursday at Carrick-on-Suir. The reputed witch, Mary Doheny, was placed in the dock, and she had an infant, a few months old, in her arms. She is the wife of a blind man, and has been in the neighbourhood about fourteen months. Tho principal witnesses, a constable named Reeves, and his wife said that the prisoner lived with them "almost constantly, eating, drinking, and 'bewitching' Mrs. Reeves, until she has grown, who before had been a fine, handsome looking woman, pale and emaciated, with peculiarly lustrous but sunken eyes." The father of Mrs. Reeves was a man named Mullins, who died some years ago. The "witch," about two months since, brought Reeves and his wife to "an unoccupied house near the railway bridge, and at twelve at night—this they have actually sworn to— showed them the father and child of Mrs. Reeves and another relative, Tom Sheehan, actually alive!" Ever since, with extreme regularity, Reeves and his wife have prepared food and sent their niece with it to Mrs. Doheny, for the use of their relatives and the child who had "come to life." Mrs. Reeves swore her father "died about three years ago, and was buried in Carrick on-Suir: but he is now living in Carrick-on-Suir." When asked how she could say that, she answered, "Because I saw him. I had a whisper from him; his voice was heard by night, and afterwards Mrs. Doheny brought me and showed him to me. She also showed me Tom Sheehan, who was lame, and my own child. They were all alive. I sent them food regularly, and upon one occasion I sent my father my chemise to serve as a shirt for him!" Mrs. Reeves gave her evidience in a clear, collected, and positive manner. Her niece, who took the food to Tom Sheehan, swore positively that she gave the food to him and no one else. Hayes, a retired policeman, came forward, and as positively deposed on oath that he knew some of his own relatives brought to life. Prisoner showed Mullins to him. He believed in ghosts; "for," said he, "I saw one of the county Cork, standing outside the door where a cousin of mine was walking." "It is not so extraordinary," he added, "for persons to be raised from the dead." As the case proceeded the prisoner fainted, or pretended to do so. The people in court seemed to have very little sympathy for her, and many of them are said to have appeared awe-struck.— The magistrates committed her to the quarter sessions on a charge of having obtained money under false pretences.

Glasgow Saturday Post, and Paisley and Renfrewshire Reformer - Saturday 24 September 1864

THE TIPPERARY WITCH. There is something much more pleasant and touching about the Irish rustic superstitions than there is about the English. Superstition makes the English boor simply brutal and pitiless, while in the Irish peasant it excites the lively credulous imagination of a child. The belief in fairies or kindly preternatural agencies has wholly vanished from England, while the belief in demons or the black art still lingers to a considerable extent. How different the state of feeling is in Ireland the very curious examination of three or four "bewitched" people before the magistrates of Carrick-on-Suir,Tipperary, Thursday week will sufficiently show. The witch was one Mrs Mary Doheny, the wife of blind man, who appeared at Carrick-on-Suir about fourteen months ago with a reputation for preternatural powers which she soon began to sustain and increase. The charge against her was cheating certain persons afterwards examined in court, and who were evidently far from admitting that they had been cheated all, out of subsidies not in money but in food, on the false pretence that they were for the support of deceased relatives of the contributors recently restored to life—or sufficiently so to need food. The scene in the Court House of Carick-on-Suir was a very curious one. People of all ranks thronged from all sides to hear the examination, and even the most educated persons present were, it is said, in parts of the evidence visibly awestruck and confounded by the siomple faith and earnest testimony of more than one witness to the preternatural facts alleged. The witnesses called against Mrs Doheny certainly testified to the continuous stream of subsidies with which they had supplied her for their rather uncomfortably situated relatives—who appear to have *half* got back from the grave, but still to be, if we may so term it, spiritual invalids living on earth, but in mysterious seclusion amongst the "good people," and preparing on a mild diet of tea and other food generally known to the medical profession as "slops" for their more active return to life; but while they gave this evidence they not only imputed no falsehood to Mrs Doheny, but were even eager in their simple faith that the subsidies had actually been needed and consumed by their half-reanimated kinsmen, whom they had, they said, seen with their own eyes. There is something inexpressibly childlike about the whole story. In reading it we feel as if we were present at the birth of one of those Irish fairy legends related with much spirit by Mr Lover, in which humpbacks sleeping in haunted moats so please the "good people" as not only to get rid of their humps but have them transferred to the persons of their cruel enemies, or banshees flit round decaying mansions wailing forth the deathsong of some one of its inmates. There were no fewer apparently than five independent witnesses who asserted that they had seen the forms of relatives long dead restored life, always it appears in Mrs Doheny's presence, though she does not seem to have claimed any power in the matter. The first witness was "Sub-Constable Joseph Reeves," who stated that after Mrs Doheny's appearance at Carrick-on-Suir some fourteen months ago she began to doctor his child for him with herbs. The child was afflicted with epilepsy, and Mrs Doheny's remedies certainly gained it quieter sleep, he thought, that it had ever had before. But after this little experiment in the healing art, in which she does not appear have been strikingly successful, she seems to have diverted her energies into more exciting channels. We are told that one night at twelve o'clock, while Mrs Doheny's medical attentions were being directed to the child, Mrs Reeves, the wife of the sub-constable, had a vision when she was "in bed, but not asleep," of her deceased father Mr Mullins, who said "he would return home to me in perfection"—whatever that may have meant. Mrs Doheny "had not said anything to me of my father till I told her this circumstance," but the remark appears to have been carefully laid up in Mrs Doheny'a heart, and to have suggested the important change of her "base of operations" from administering physical sedatives to the child to administering spiritual stimulants to the parents. After the hint dropped by Mrs Reeves, that her father would return to her "in perfection," Mrs Doheny appears to have made statements the effect that he *had* returned to life, and would soon manifest himself to his daughter and her family. About four months or more ago "Sub-Constable Joseph Reeves" was asked by Mrs Doheny go with her Knockroe, where he would see his late father-in-law. The man, accompanied by his boy Terence, a child of eight years of age, started, but on getting to Knockroe appears to have seen nothing till Mrs Doheny came up ten minutes after him, when pointing in a particular direction she asked Reeves if he saw anything. I replied, 'Yes,' for I saw father in-Law William Mullins, who had been dead three years, about 20 yards distant from me." Asked by the magistrate whether he was frightened, Reeves replied simply. "I was not, sir; this rare case in a court of justice, and a laughable one to some people, but there have been instances of the kind before." He had known his father-in-law, he said, for 16 years, and "ought" to know him. "We remained looking at him for time; he was standing in the field with a stick in his hand; his side-face was turned towards me. There was good light at the time, about eight o'clock in the evening. I don't think William Mullins is dead now, but he *was* dead. I have been sending him food for the last four months since he came to life. I sent bread, butter, and tea once in each of the twenty-four hours, sometimes by the defendant and sometimes by my wife's niece. Defendant asked in my presence for the food, and as it was after I had seen William Mullins alive, I consented." Reeves further said that he had lost a son named William, who had died at seven years of age in 1860. Two months ago Mrs Doheny told him "to go Duggan's waste-house and I would see him." This he did, again with his son Terence, and he asserts that they both saw his late son William standing inside the window with his dead aunt (Margaret Power) who had died about seven years ago. "They came to the window and I walked up to it, —there was only the glass between us. . . The boy Terence remarked to me when they came to the window, 'There's Will and his aunt.'" We may casually note here the remarkably tenacious memory of the living boy Terence, who is only eight years old. His little brother had died when he was only four years old, and his aunt when he was only *one* year old; but he recognises them at once. The dead or risen boy was said to be in the same clothes in which he died. The magistrate, asking if the lad had had his clothes on when he died, his mother, who was sitting in court, cried out, "Oh, God help us! he had, he had!" and Reeves goes on, "Yes, he died in his chair; he appeared to me to have grown since he died; he did not look very badly, though he was delicate; he had no hat on." Of the aunt he says that she did not wear a crinoline, "they were not in fashion when she died," —but we are not assured whether she died in those clothes or has dressed *since*.There also appears to have been a separate manifestation of some of these deceased persons to Mrs Reeves. Mrs Doheny, she said, brought her father "and showed him me. She also showed me Tom Sheehan (a deceased relative of Reeves), who was lame, and my own child. They were all alive." The niece of Mrs Reeves, who is described as a "fine, intelligent girl," also swore positively that every night, —but "after dark," — she brought tea, milk, butter, bread, and other food, and gave them to her uncle Tom Sheehan, who was always standing under the wall of the old "waste-house." She swore positively that it was to her deceased uncle Tom Sheehan, and no one else, that she delivered the food. A fifth witness was ex-policeman, James Hayes, but as he had known none of the deceased parties in their lifetime except by description, his evidence only proved that he had seen persons whom he believed on his friends' word to be dead people restored to life. These persons still appear to in a very delicate state. The dead father Mullins indeed seems to be hearty, under the protection of the "good people," smokes, and can manage new potatoes and eggs. But "Mrs Doheny said my sisters and son were too delicate to eat new potatoes and eggs, and I changed the diet next night." Some tea was sent back as not good enough for the wards of the fairies, two months ago, and fresh tea of a better quality was substituted. William Mullins wanted clothes but once; and then he made shift with one of his daughter's *chemises* for a shirt. The promise held out by Mrs appears to be that ail these shadowy forms now undergoing their novitiate for a second earthly life in the deserted house near the moat of Ballydine will, after due assimilation respectively of new potatoes, eggs, and bread and milk by the harder men, and superior tea by the boy and women, be able to come back quite to life, and that whenever that occurs, they will "bring their living with them," —an event apparently much to be desired, as the intermediate state is rather expensive to relations who are still enjoying their *first* lease of life, and on whom it is rather hard to ask them to work so hard for relatives who are about to enjoy their second. However, when they *quite* return to life they are to bring not only money but "land in the county of Waterford"—or perhaps rather the *title* to it—with them, which is certainly a consolatory hope; only as the title can only have been gained by a conveyance effected in the other world, it must still be a haraasing doubt to the sub-constable whether earthly lawyers will recognize its validity.—*Spectator.*

The popular naming of the story was also to change, with Mary Doheny's coming to be known as "the Carrick Witch", with an ever growing reputation:

THE CARRICK WITCH.

"Tho' absent, ever dear," is the motto of the faithful Carrick people in regard to Mrs. Doheny, the witch. While she remains in durance vile at Clonmel, her influence appears to have increased at home. Some whose position and circumstances ought to give hope for better, are firm believers in her powers, and positively assert that at each midnight she revisits the scenes of her fame, the bolts, bars and padlocks of the gaol notwithstanding. Others, well-to do and somewhat intelligent people, who would fain laugh at superstition, have not courage to deny the "fairy woman," who needed only to skim with her charmed bowl St. Nicholas's well (Carrick), and so take all the butler belonging to him who was the object of her wrath. "Then," said our informant, "you might church till your hands would cling to the staff, and nothing would come but butter milk!" The supplying of food to the dead men still goes on, the niece of Reeves going regularly with her basket at nightfall to where the resurrectionists assemble, and it is curious that although many times watched by policemen and town watchmen, as also by others, neither the dead men, nor their impersonators can be seen, and yet the basket is always delivered. —*Clonmel Chronicle.*

Even as she was imprisoned, the *North British Daily Mail* would have its readers belive her reputation as a witch continued to grow.

Although Mrs Doheny, the Carrick witch, is in *durance vile*, it is believed in the neighbourhood where she so successfully deluded a number of individuals that she "laughs at locksmiths," and every night revisits the scene of her former exploits. The Waterford Mail states that "the supply of food to the dead men still goes on, the niece of Reeves going regulalry with her basket at nightfall to where the resurrectionists, assmeble, and it is curious that, although many times watched by policemen and town watchmen, as also by others, neither dead men nor their impersonators can be seen, and the basket is always delivered."

Looking slightly further afield, we note that Mary Doheny was not the only person using spiritualist wiles to get the odd freebie...

WITCHCRAFT— We learn from Limerick, that a wierd sister of Mrs. Doheny the "Carrick witch" at present residing in our county gaol, has also come to grief in that locality. The case came on for heanng at the last Casticeonnell petty sessions, avd attracted a great deal of interest. A large number of magistrates attended, including the following: R. G. Gibbett, Eyre Lloyd, C. Powell, Helenus White, George Sampson, and E.G Bell, R.M. Esqrs. A woman named O'Grady, *alias* Sheridan *alias* Hogan, with an nfant in her arms, was brought up in custody on a charge of having obtained money under false pretences. From the evidence of several witnesses it would that the prisoner, who is a stranger, lately made her appearance in Castleconnell and immediately commenced her work of imposture on the credulons people of that locality. She first introduced herself to a Mr O'Brien, publican, into whose house she had gone for a drink, and represented to him that she was an agent between this and the spiritual world, and could foretell things to come. After some conversation with her, Mr O'Brien was induced to give her 13d, 1s of which she wrapped ina piece of paper, and pretended to cast into the fire as a votive offering to the inhabitants of the other world, through whom she feigned to derive her divine knowledge. It is unnecessary to say what she did with the shilling. When preliminaries had been accomplished she told him there were a great many enemies near him, and that she would be able to rid him of those unpleasant monsters. After succeeding in duping Mr. O'Brien out of another shilling and some whiskey she went on to give a history of his future prospects in life. The spirits she had taken appeared to have little or no relation with the dubious phantoms of the phantoms of the same name somewhere else, for instead of affording her assistance to complete her swindle, they completely deprived her of of her senses and consequently of her powers of whitchraft. Mr. O'Brien began to suspect her, and ultimately gave her into custody. It afterwards transpired that she had been successful on two occasions previously in vicitimising others in a similar manner. She went to the house of a pensioner named John Fanning and asked to be permitted to boil some water. This request was conceded to her, and in the meantime she became interested for the safety of Fanning. He was on the eve of a serious fit of illness, and she had means of obviating it. Fenning `[sic]` was much obliged for her forewarning, and tendered her some money, she in return pretended to sew within the lining of his trousers a piece of herb which was brought from Jerusalem and which he did not attempt to open lest the charm would lose its influence. For these and other acts of imposition the prisoner was brought before the court. The magistrates said the cases were clearly proved but as the money had been given to her voluntariy, they would not inflict that severe sentence which the aggravated nature of the offence deserved. She should be imprisoned for one month with hard labour.

TRIAL OF THE CARRICK WITCH. A woman, named Mary Doheny, known as "the Carrick Witch," has been tried at the Clonmel Quarter Sessions for fraudulently obtaining goods from Joseph and Mary Reeves, at Carrick-on-Suir, on the 1st of June, 1864. Mary Beeves deposed that the prisoner had attempted to cure one of her children with herbs boiled in new milk, and continued attending the house for the purpose nearly every day during ten months. She said she used to see her dead father and other dead members of the witness's family in the Moate at Ballydine; and, as a proof, prisoner said that witness was to get a note from them, which Captain James Power was to write for them. Witness's child was sent for the note, and several letters were received purporting to come from the deceased relatives. The prisoner next said she wanted bread, butter, and tea for the people in the Moate, and these were daily supplied during four months. Witness also fancied that she saw her own deceased father. He was sitting in a chair opposite the door, quite near her, having on a blue a coat, knee breeches, and a hat. He said three times he was going, and that he would return with plenty; and the prisoner said he was going with "the gentry," but would return. The prisoner often asked the witness for wine and spirits. Since her arrest there was no appearance from the other world. The husband of this woman, Joseph Reeves, a sub-constable, now stationed at Kilmainham, near Dublin, was as great a dupe as his wife. He deposed that he saw and knew his father-in law, who was only 20 yards from him. He believed that the man had come to life, and thought he had a ghostly appearance. He never saw a dead man standing before. He saw his son also in an empty house where he was brought by the prisoner. He, too, had a ghostly appearance, and had not the shape of a living person, and the prisoner stated that it would take a considerable time for him to come to perfection. The jury found the prisoner "Guilty." Mr. Serjeant Howley, who presided on the Bench, stated that he had been informed by Mr. Beard, sub-inspector of constabulary, that the dead persons had been personated by the prisoner's blind husband, and a man who led them about. One of the apparitions was at dark, and the other in the night. The prisoner then cried, "Oh, my Lord, think of my poor blind man and my poor children!" The Court: You are a terrible woman and a dangerous impostor. You must be confined in gaol for twelve months, and kept to hard labour.

The Carrick Witch. —Mary Doheny, known the "Carrick Witch," was tried at the Clonmel Quarter Sessions last week for fraudulently obtaining goods from Joseph and Mary Reeves, at Carrick-on-Suir, on the 1st of June, 1864.

You must be confined in gaol for twelve months, and kept hard labour."

But what of the details of the case, as they played out in Court?

His Lordship, addressing the grand jury, said— Gentlemen, the cases on the calendar to come before yon are very few, and there is no case of any particular significance connected with the peace of the county. The cases are of an ordinary nature, and you cannot have any difficulty in investigating the charges set forth in the different indictments. However, there is one case to come before you of rather an unusual character, in some respects, but in others, perhaps, not very extraordinary. That is the case of person charged with obtaining property under false pretences, and it would appear, from looking over the depositions, that the facts are follows:— The person charged represented that she was possessed of some extraordinary powers of communing with the spiritual world, and it seems that she went to a member of the police force, and to his wife, and stated to the man that she had seen his father and father-in-law, who were dead for some years; that they were now in the land of the living; and, with these pretences, gentlemen, she perfectly "possessed" this policeman, who is still in the force, and exercised a like influence over his wife also. The policeman appears to have been a person of good character —a steady, sober man —performing hia duty properly, with nothing about him to show that, upon any other, save in regard to the representations, of this woman, suffered any delusion of mind. At all events, her statements had such effect upon the man and his wife that they thoroughly believed what she told them, nnd were positive that the persons she asserted she called upon from the world of spirits were the parties she indicated—namely, the man's father and father-in-law. Upon these representations the woman obtained food and various other things for the use and benefit, as she alleged, of those who were now, according to her statements, capable of making use of material comforts of life. She got food and other matters under the pretence that she would take them to the father and father-in-law of Joseph Reeves, the policeman. Now, gentlemen, it does not affect the case, or justify the prisoner, that the policeman or his wife were perfectly satisfied that the persons whom she showed them were their relatives, long deceased; and, gentlemen, the law with regard to false pretences is that a man is indictable where he states, as an existing fact, what he knows to be false, and gets money or other property upon such representations. But no future promise will constitute a false pretence. Let me explain. Suppose the woman said, "give me some money or some food, and I'll bring it to your father-in-law," it does not declare any fact. But if she says, your father-in-law is living," though long since dead, then that would be the declaration of a fact that was false; and if, upon this representation, she solicited food for the deceased, then this would amount to a false pictence, provided that the woman herself was fully under the impression that what she stated was false. If, on the contrary, the woman was labouring nnder a false impression some such hallucination as that which seems to have possessed Reeves and his wife—if she believed that the dead had really come to life—then no indictment for false pretence could at law be established against her. With these general observations I will leave the case to you for investigation. You will see in the indictment that it is stated she said that Reeves' father and father-in-law are living, and she got food for them. If these facts are proved and that you believe that she knew stated what was false, you will be justified in finding true bill against her.

THE CARRICK WITCH.

Mary Doheny was charged with fraudulently obtaining goods from Joseph and Mary Reeves at Carrick-on-Snir on tho Ist of June, 1864.

Mary Reeves sworn and examined by Mr. Bolton —I am the wife of Joseph Reeves, subconstable; he was stationed in Carrick-on-Suir on the 1st of June; my father's name was William Mullins; he was dead three years last May; I had three sisters, two of whom I knew to be dead, one over ten years and the other about seven years; I had a child, William, who died four years ago; I know the prisoner Mary Doheny; I had a conversation with her about my dead relatives in last June; I know her for more than twelve months; I first spoke to her about curing one of my children who gets weaknesses; she gave the child some herbs boiled on new milk several times; she commenced attending the child about ten months ago, and continued so for more than a month; she continued coming to my house after that nearly every day; I was one night after quenching the light in my house when I saw my father; it was before the month of May; had been speaking to the prisoner about my father before this; she drew down the conversation; she said she used to see my father and all the family in the moate at Ballydine; she told me so more than once; she told me afterwards that they were coming home from Ballydine moate; had told her before this that they were all dead; I said I'd hardly believe her, and she said I would get a note from them (suppressed laughter in court) ; she desired to have my child go to the moate at Ballydine, and that Captain James Power would write the note for my people; he is also dead, but she said he was in the moate; sent the child for the letter; Mary Doheny went with him; they came back together; the child had the note, and he gave it to me; the child told me he got the note from a man who dropped it to him in a field; got a great number of letters on the same day from Captain James and others; they were brought either by my child or the prisoner; the prisoner told me about the 5th of May to send some bread and butter, as my sister and sou had come home to this world to live here; they were coming one by one, as she said, and I increased the supply; the last came home the fair day of Glin; she told me to send the food for them to eat it; I gave her bread, butter, and tea, and she said she delivered it to them; was giving them to her for four months once every evening; some eggs were sent; she returned them, saying they did not agree with my child, who was coming home; would not have given her those things but that I thought she was giving them to my people; believed her at that time; she subsequently took the letters from me, but they were got with her by Mr Heard, S.I.

Cross-examined Mr. Vowell— I was examined in this case at Carrick-on-Suir; remember what I swore then; Mary Doheny lived near me and was in the habit of coming to my place; the first time I spoke to her was when she came to care my child; my child is foolish; she gets weaknesses and walks in her sleep; she said first that she would cure my child to perfection.

Court— There is no charge against the prisoner for not curing the child.

Mr Vowell— I only examine her to test her accuracy, my lord.

To Mr. Vowell—The child remained in bed at night for about a month after she gave her the first dose, but she did no good otherwise; I said in conversation to her that my father was dead; she told me after that my father and sisters had come home, and that he was in a house in Carrick, and that I should support him there until they were relieved out of Duggan's store; I saw my father one night at twelve o'clock; about two months after she told me he had come home; I was glad to hear people were coming back; I believed at the time he was coming; I once went to the gate leading to the store from which she said I would see them; it was on a Sunday; I did not see them; I did not there after; I was in bed about three quarters of an hour when I saw my father; I did see him; he was sitting on a chair in the kitchen, opposite the door; he was quite near me; my husband was in bed but was asleep; I did not speak to my father, nor did he to me; he spoke to me after that night between eleven and twelve; I know he was not alive when I saw him first; he had a blue coat, knee breeches, and hat on; he also had a stick in his hand; his voice came to the next door, and I heard him saying he was going three times, but that he would return.

At Mr Vowell'a request, Mr Dorney read the informations sworn to by witness at Carrick, in which it was alleged that her father spoke to her two nights before appeared to her.

To Mr Vowell—My father said three times that he was going but that he would return with plenty; I did not believe he was alive then, for she said he was going with the gentry; I heard a child's voice outside the door another night which I believed was my child's voice; I said in Carrick that I gave the things of own free-will, but when I did thought they were for my family; what I did not swear in Carrick I now say, that the prisoner often asked me for wine and spirits; I did not see or hear from my father since the prisoner was arrested.

To the Court—She asked me first to send them bread and butter, and I afterwards sent them freely.

Sub constable Joseph Reeves sworn.

Mr. Bolton said he would not examine him. He would only produce additional witnesses for crossexamination.

Examination Mr Vowell— I am a long time in the force; I was removed from Carrick to Clonmel, and am now stationed at Kilmanahan; I remember when the prisoner came to my house to cure my child; she said first that she would cure her, but afterwards that she could not do so entirely; I knew my fatherin-law well; he is dead over four years. I saw man about eight months ago at Knockroe which I believed was my father-in-law. He was about twenty yards from me. It was in the dusk of the evening. He had a black coat and trousers on him. I believed that he was dead at the time, but he came to life after. He seemed to have a ghostly appenrance. I never saw a dead man standing before (laughter.) He was leaning on a stick. I only saw him once. The prisoner told me after that he would come home and I believed he came to life. I had a son William. I know Duggan's store. I saw my son in an unoccupied house belonging to Duggan. The prisoner told me to go there and that I would see her. I went quite close to the window and I saw my son near it, inside; I was looking at him for five minutes. I saw him in a ghostly appearance inside. He was not in the shape of a living person, but the prisoner told me it would take a considerable time before they would come to perfection. I believed he was alive. I never saw Captain Power dead or alive or on horseback. I was present on about a dozen occasions when the food was sent. I heard Mrs Doheny ask for the food on the first occasion. I never told you when leaving the court-house in Carrick that the prisoner never asked for the food.

Mr Vowell, addressing the jury for the defence, said —Gentlemen of the jury—I am sure you will agree with me when I say this is as novel a case as was ever tried by twelve living men (laughter)—it certhinly is as curious a one as ever came within my knowledge.— This woman is charged with fraudulently obtaining food, but I don't think that you will say by your verdict that you believe the evidence of the two parties who have sworn to you that when they supplied the provisions they firmly believed that Mullins and the others mentioned were in the land of the living. If you believe that you must bring in a verdict of insanity against Reeves' wife, that both must have been out of their senses at that particular period— if you can't believe them in that regard, what becomes of their evidence to-day?— how can you give credence to it ?—the woman contradicts what she swore to on the 1st June; she then said it was of her own free will she sent the food; to-day she has changed her tactics and swear* that it was at the solicitations of the prisoner; you will I am sure be of opinion, that at the time those people were labouring under some hallucination, and that if would not be safe or just for you to consign my client to gaol upon such evidence; it is unnecessary that I should detain you further, but I must direct your attention to one point, it has not been proved that those people were dead, they may be in the land of the living and—

Mr. Bolton—Oh, it has been distinctly proved.

Mr. Vowell— The witnesses said so, but that is no proof, however, gentlemen, leave the case in your hands, satisfied that you will pronounce a just and impartial verdict.

His Lordship addressed the jury and said—Gentlemen, the case is a short one. Much matter has been introduced into it which could have nothing to do with the issue you have to try. All about the illness of the child, and the treatment to which she was subjected is extraneous and unnecessary evidence except that it may tend to show the manner in which the alleged fraud was brought about. The woman is charged with representing to Mrs. Reeves that persons long since dead were in progress to life again, at one time partially alive with the good people, and that they were "coming home" for the purpose of fraudulently obtaining food from her. He said if you believe the evidence that they were in a house in Carrick-on-Suir, and that they should be supported there until they became perfect in their bodies. If you believe she made those statements well knowing them to be false, and having succeeded in making an impression on Mrs. Reeeves, and that she induced her to give the food under the superstition that her relatives were living, and that they required sustenance that would amount to getting the food under false pretences. With the credulity of those people you have nothing to do; they appear to have been very credulous, and I believe that many persons of a condition in life much above theirs have faith in similar matters; but if believe that acting on the woman's statement and her requisition that Mrs. Reeves thought her relatives wanted food and gave it accordingly, that amounts to a state of facta which support the indictment, or if knowing they were not dead the prisoner got this food, and used it to herself, that would maintain the case. If in the first instance she told Mrs. Reeves that hee father was alive, and if without more said Mrs. Reeves gave her the food that would not amount to false pretences, there should be a request made for it. These are the facts of the case, gentlemen, and if you believe the evidence, gentlemen, it will be your duty to find the prisoner Guilty.

After few moments' deliberation, the jury handed in a verdict of guilty.

Court— You could not return a more proper verdict. The party sitting on the chair, and those seen in the house and in the field, were, I am told, persons instructed by the prisoner, and she had impressed her victims in the belief that they were their relatives. One was shown in the dusk of the evening; another was seen at night. Since the trial took place I have been speaking to Mr. Heard, S.I., and he informs me that the prisoner's husband, and a man who led him about, were the parties who personated those characters, and their imaginations were so wrought up that the imposture succeeded.

Prisoner—Oh, think of my poor blind man and two poor children.

Court— You are a terrible woman and a dangerous impostor, yon must confined in gaol for twelve months, and kept to hard labour.

There being no other cases to be disposed of, the court adjourned.

Clonmel Chronicle - Saturday 22 October 1864

CARRICK-ON-SUIR WITCHCRAFT CASE

Mary Doheney was called to plead to the following indictment:—"That she, on 1st June, 1864, at Carrick-on-Suir, in the county Tipperary, unlawfully, knowingly, and designedly, did falsely pretend to one Mary Reeves that Wm. Mullins, the father of the said Mary Reeves—a child of the said Mary Reeves, and three sisters of the said Mary Reeves— and which said Wm. Mullins, Wm. Reeves, and said three sisters of the said Mary Reeves, were all long previously dead— were all in life again in human form, and had from time to time appeared to and was seen by the said Mary Doheny, and that they ate and consumed food, by means of which false pretences said Mary Doheny did then unlawfully obtain from the said Mary Reeves certain goods and chattels—to wit, bread, tea, a nightdress, and one pair of stockings, with intent thereby to defraud; whereas, in truth and in fact, the said Wm. Mullins, Wm. Reeves, and said three sisters of said Mary Reeves were all then dead, and were not, nor were any one of them alive. Nor did they, the said Wm. Mullins, Wm. Reeves, and the said three sisters of the said Mary Reeves, nor either nor any of them, from time to time, nor at any time at all, appear or were seen by the said Mary Doheny; to the evil example of all others— in like case, offending against the form of the statute in such cases made and provided, and against the peace of our lady the Queen, her crown and dignity."

In a loud voice she pleaded "Not Guilty." A second indictment, equally length, was read, and to this also the same plea was made.

The prisoner was then given in charge.

Mary Reeves examined by Mr. Bolton — I am the wife of Sub-Constable Joseph Reeves; he was stationed at Carrick-on-Suir; my father's name was Wm. Mullins; he is dead three years last May; I had three sisters, who died; I did not hear of the third dying, but I heard of two of them dying; one of them is dead about ten years, and the other one six years; I had a child that died; his name was William Reeves; he is dead four years; I know the prisoner, Mary Doheny; had conversations with her about my father, sisters, and child.

Did she make any statement about these persons? She did.

Did you know her before? I did, over 12 months. At first she had a conversation with me about one of my children who is delicate. She came to cure her.

Did she give her anything? She did, sir; she gave her some herbs boiled on new milk. She gave the child these things several times; it is about ten or eleven months since she first attended my child; she was attending the child over a month; after that she gave over the child, but continued coming to my place; I was not in the barracks with my husband; she came every day to my house, and was coming for some months.

How did you come to talk about the father? I was one night in my house before May, and shortly after quenching the light, I saw my father.

Had you any conversation with the prisoner about your father before that night? I had.

How long before that night? I could not tell.

Who drew down the conversation? She commenced it. I had more than one conversation with her; she told me she used to see my father; she told me so in my my own house.

Did she tell you when and where you had seen him? Yes, she stated she had seen all my family in the moate at Ballydine. She told me that more than once.

Did she say anything more at that time? She did not for a while after.

What did she tell you? She told me that they were coming home.

From where? From Ballydine moate.

Had you told her anything about whether they were alive or dead? I told her that they were dead, and she knew from me that they were. I told her then, my lord, that I would hardly believe her, and she said I would get a note from them (laughter in court).

Did she tell you how you would get the letter? She did, sir; she told me that my child would get it.

From whom? From Captain Power, who was to write for them.

Is Captain Power dead? He is, sir, and she told me that he would write for my family; that he was in the moate of Ballydine (laughter).

Did you send your child for the letter? I did, sir.

Did any one go with him? The prisoner did. They returned, and the child handed me a note in the prisoner's presence.

Did the child tell you where he got it, in the presence of the prisoner? He did. He said that a man dropped it in a field.

Did you get many letters? I did, in the same way from Captain Power, who wrote for my dead relatives. Some were conveyed by the prisoner and others by the child; when by the latter, the prisoner was generally in his company.

Was there anything said by the prisoner about sending them eatables? There was. About the fifth of May the first bit was sent to them. She told me to send them some food, that my sister and son were come home to this earth.

That they came back to this world? Yes, sir. That they were coming to live here again. They were then coming home, one by one, until she said all had come back. There was about a week from the time the first of my family came home until the last came. When they were all at home, I commenced to send bread.

Why did you send them bread? She told me.

For what purpose? For to eat it. I gave her bread and butter and tea, which she told me she delivered to my family.

Did you give her those things more than once? I was giving them to her every night for four months. The prisoner always told me she was giving it to my family. There were some eggs sent.

Did the prisoner say anything about the eggs? She returned them once, saying that my child that had died, but had come home, had turned against them. I would not have given those things to the prisoner but that I thought she was delivering them to my people.

Did you believe her statement that your people were alive? I did at that time, and that was the reason I gave her food.

Did you give the letters you got to Mr. Heard? I got them from Mrs. Doheny and my son, but she took them back again, and they were found with her.

To Mr. Vowell—I was examined on this subject at Carrick-on-Suir; I recollect what I swore on that occasion; I know Mary Doheny twelve months before this.

What was the reason she came so often to your house? To cure my child. She came to tell me that she would cure my child, who was foolish and took weaknesses six or seven times a day.

Did she not tell you that she would only keep her quiet at night, but could not do anything else? She did not; she said that she would cure her as well as myself.

Did she do any good to the child? She did not, but she kept her quiet for a month in bed, after whatever she gave her.

Is not that doing her good? Yes.

Why did she not continue it? My husband said she had done the child some good, but I did not; I used to say in conversation with her, that my father was dead; she told me, after that, that my father was in a house in Carrick, but had to remain a length of time there before coming home, and that I should support him there.

Court—Where was your father to come home to? To me.

Mr. Vowell—Did she tell you what house they were in? She did, sir.

What house? In Mr. Duggan's store; that store is a waste one.

You say you saw your father one night about twelve o'clock? Yes, sir.

How long before you saw him did the prisoner say he was in that house of Duggan's? About two months.

I suppose you were very glad to hear that your poor father was coming back? Well, I was, sir.

Did you believe at that time that he was coming back? I did at that time, while I was getting the letters.

Did you go to see them and welcome them home? She told me I would see them through the windows, and I went one Sunday, but I could not see them.

Well you swear they were not in the store? I will not; but if they were there I would see them.

Were you in bed when you saw your father? I was, about three quarters of an hour.

Did you see him? I did.

Where was he? Sitting on a chair in the kitchen from me; he was sitting down opposite the door, quite near me; my husband was in bed at the time; he was not awake.

Did you welcome your father back? I spoke nothing to him, nor he to me that time.

Did he speak at all that night? He did not, but he spoke to me after that night, between eleven and twelve o'clock.

How long did he remain in the chair? He disappeared at once.

Was he dead or alive? I could not say.

Had you any doubt but that it was your father? I believe it was. He was dressed in a blue body-coat and knee-breeches, with a stick in his had and his hat on. After that he came to the door and spoke to me, and said that he would come three times and go away; I did not see him after that.

The informations of the witness were here read. They stated that it was previous to seeing her father that she spoke to him. The depositions we have already published.

Now, as you say *after* instead of before, seeing your father, that he spoke to you, what did he say? He said he was going three times, but would return again.

Did you believe your father was alive when you saw him? I did not. He told me that he was going with the gentry; I also heard my child's voice after; the previous night she told me that they would be there.

Did you not swear at Carrick that anything you gave was freely given, and that Mrs. Doheny did not ask for it? I freely gave it after she told me that my people wanted it, and—what I did not swear at all to—she often asked me for meat and wine.

Upon your oath, did you not say that whatever you gave to Mrs. Doheny you gave her freely, and she did not ask you? I did, and often asked her if they (witness's dead relatives) would like those things, when I would be giving her bread and butter, and she would answer that she thought they would.

Did you not swear that Mrs. Doheny did not ask you for these things? I always gave them freely when she told me she was bringing them to her family; she often asked me for bread and butter before May.

Did you say at Carrick that you believed your father was alive? I did.

And how do you know that he is not alive now?—Because I did not hear from him since; if I did, I would believe he was alive.

To the Court—Prisoner asked me for bread and butter for my dead son, that he was come home, and I gave those things freely.

This concluded the witness's examination, and Mr. Bolton, S.C.S., said he would not examine the other witnesses, but would call them to be questioned by Mr. Vowell.

Sub-Constable Reeves examined by Mr. Yovell—I am still in the police force, and am stationed at Kilmanahan; I recollect the time prisoner attended my child; I knew her some time before; the child is unwell still; she used to get out of bed every night; Deheny gave her some herbs.

What effect did the herbs produce? They had the effect, for a short time, of making the child sleep quietly, and she did not go "romancing" about as she used. Mrs. Deheny said she would cure her at the commencement, and after about two months she said she could not cure her effectually.

Did you know your father-in-law? I did for about three years before I was married.

How long is he dead? I believe something about four years.

Did you see your father-in-law since he died? I saw a man whom I thought was my father-in-law.

Did you see a man whom you were perfectly sure was your father-in-law? I did. I saw him about seven months ago in a place called Knockroe; I saw him in a field convenient to a ditch about twenty yards from me. He wore a black coat and trousers and a hat. It was dusk at the time; the man was standing.

Did you believe your father-in-law was dead; now, answer properly? If you let me, I will answer everything; I have no desire to have Mrs. Doheny punished. When I saw the man in the field at Knockroe I did not believe he was alive, but I afterwards did.

Did you believe he was dead? I did.

And he was standing in a field? Yes; he appeared to me in his ghostly appearance.

Did you ever see a dead man standing in a field looking at you? I did not until that occasion; the man I saw was stooped, and had a stick in his hand; I did not see him after that.

Did you believe that they were alive subsequently? I did, on the prisoner's statement. I had a son named William (now dead); I know Duggan's store; I saw my son through a window standing in a waste house belonging to the store.

Court—Why did you go there? Prisoner told me to do so, and that I would see my son.

Mr. Yovell—Did you go close to the window? I did, quite close, and saw him within a yard of the window.

Did you remain long looking at him? I did, about five minutes.

Was he dead or alive? He was dead, but the prisoner told me he was after returning to this world. I said at Carrick that I believed him to be alive. He was not in shape or appearance the same as a living person. I saw him in his ghostly appearance, and, according to the prisoner's statement, it would be a considerable time before he would come to perfection.

Was it not from the evidence of your own senses, looking at your son through the window, that you believed him to be alive?—No.

Have you any senses? I have.

Did you not state at Carrick that you believed your son to be alive? I did, but he had not his proper appearance.

Did you ever see the poor captain—Captain Power? Never, to my knowledge, dead or alive, or on horseback, as the saying is.

Now, about the bread and butter given to Doheny.—Upon you oath, were they not the free offering of your wife, and not at the solicitation of Mrs. Deheny? Well, I don't know.

Did you ever hear Mrs. Deheny ask for those things? I did in the beginning.

Did you not state at Carrick that they were the free offering of your wife, and that Mrs. Deheny never asked for them? I did not state that she never asked for food.

Mr. Yovell then addressed the jury for the defence. He said—Gentlemen, this case is the most extraordinary one that, I believe, has ever been brought before a court of justice, to be tried by twelve sensible and, I hope, living men (laughter). You are called on to state whether the unfortunate woman in the dock received from Mrs. Reeves this property—viz., bread, butter, tea, and clothing—under false pretences; and I don't think you will be prepared, upon your oaths, to say by your verdict that you believe the evidence of Reeves and his wife, who swore to you that they believed that Mullins and their child were in the land of the living. If you believe that, you must find a verdict against Reeves and his wife of insanity—that they must be mad and out of their senses at the time they saw Mullins and their child. If you do not believe that they saw their dead relatives alive, then how can you believe the remainder of the evidence; and I may say the wife's evidence is very different from that given by her at Carrick. What becomes of the evidence of her when she says that on many occasions she sent food to those whom she knew were dead some years, but whom she thought then alive. Can you, gentlemen, believe the evidence of such idiotic people, who believed the dead to be alive, and capable of using food. You will not, I am sure, gentlemen, do any such thing, but you will scout the idea of sending the unfortunate prisoner to gaol for, perhaps, a long period, upon such testimony. But, by-the-bye, the crown has not proved that Mullins and the others were dead, for I take it that the evidence of Reeves and his wife goes for nothing. I now leave the case in your hands, certain that your verdict will prove that you have same opinion as the public at large have on this matter.

His Lordship, in addressing the jury, said that the charge against the prisoner was of a very simple nature—viz., that, upon representing to Mrs. Reeves that persons long since dead were in progress of life, and capable of using food, she got, on this false representation, tea, bread, &c. If the jury believed that the prisoner did make use of those statements, well knowing them to be false, and upon such representations obtained food, &c., from Mrs. Reeves, then the indictment was sustained. The credulity of Reeves and his wife had nothing whatever to do with the matter.

The jury found the prisoner GUILTY.

His Lordship said that it struck him at once that in all the places mentioned by the witnesses as where they saw their dead relatives, there must have been real people, dressed in a peculiar way, put there by the prisoner for her own purposes. He had just been informed by Mr. Heard, S.I., that her husband acted on those occasions. However, it was a clever piece of imposture.

Prisoner–Oh, think of my blind man and three children. Mr. Gough, I throw myself in your hands, sir.

Court——this, I find, prisoner, is not your first offense. You are a clever woman–a most clever impostor.

Prisoner– Oh––

Court– You must go to gaol for twelve months, and be kept to hard labour.

As well as reporting on the court proceedings, the *Clonmel Chronicle* sought to identify what might have given Mary Doheny the idea to perpetrate such a fraud, suggesting it might well have been a case she would have heard when acting as a witness in another case, at Dungarvan, several years before.

Clonmel Chronicle - Saturday 22 October 1864

THE CARRICK-ON-SUIR WITCHCRAFT CASE.

This case, tried at our Quarter Sessions, naturally excited considerable interest, and a crowded court leaned as it were anxiously forward, to catch a glimpse of the woman whose influence had wrought a spell over a police constable of thirty years' standing, over his entire family, and several other persons besides. When she was put forward in the dock Molly Doheny — for this was the very unromantic name which the Sybil possessed — bowed to the learned sergeant and to their worships — and dawdling an infant in her arms, she stood most unconcernedly while the Deputy Clerk of the Peace, Mr. Thomas Derney, was reading through the voluminous indictments, which covered several sheets of parchment, and bristled with as many counts as a porcupine has quills! Those indictments indeed ingeniously prepared to meet the legal difficulties which at first presented themselves to the able Sessional Crown Solicitor for this county, owing to the rather imperfect nature of the evidence; and even as it was, there seemed, up to the very evening preceding the trial, but little chance of the crown succeeding against the prisoner; while it was feared that a clever, and a heartless imposter, would be acquitted of the charge preferred against ber, and that she would be once more let loose unpunished upon society, to play her pranks, and trade upon the ridiculous credulity, of not only policemen and their wives, but also upon the dairy women of the country, from whom she has coaxed many a five pound note to bring back milk to their cows when dry. Sub-Constable Reeves and his wife have been brought very much to their senses. The hallucination has worn off; it has been chased away in some measure through the ingenuity of the police officer, Mr Heard, who made the woman send the food, as heretofore, to her deceased relatives. When Mrs. Reeves found that the "shadowy hand" was no longer pushed out from the supposed resting place of embodied spirits— namely, from the hole in the wall at Duggan's old store — when she saw the bread, butter, and tea, brought back unconsumed, the poor woman very naturally began to think that Mary Doheny's imprisonment in gaol had something to do with the return of the food. A glimmering of light broke in upon the bewitched family, and while in this frame of mind the sub-inspector found little difficulty in procuring such conclusive evidence of the prisoner having solicited and obtained money under false pretences, as to lay the foundation of a second case against her at a future time should the present indictment break down. Mrs. Reeves, on Tuesday evening last, freely confessed that "the witch" asked her three times for *eleven* pence—a larger or a smaller sum would break the charm—to be used in providing a certain medicine necessary for the purpose of raising her friends from the dead. Having then implicit faith in the power of the sorceress she gave the money. Here was an unquestionable offence against the law, but the report of the case as tried before the court on Wednesday last, and which report will be found in another column, will show that there was sufficient testimony already to convict the prisoner, and she was convicted, and sentenced to twelve months' imprisonment and hard labour.

WITCHCRAFT IN DUNGARVAN.

We think we have found the source from Mary Doheny, "the Carrick Witch," derived her inspiration. About ten years ago she was present in court at the Dungarvan Quarter Sessions, when a notorious character, who had bewitched several ignorant country people, was brought to trial on charge of false pretence, and robbery from the dwelling where she had been entertained. The history of this case and its belongings is strange—nay, absolutely ludicrous—and it may not be out of place to refer to its leading features. There lived near Abbeyside an humble man named Crow, half-fisherman, half farmer, several members of whose family had emigrated. His cottage was about three miles distant from one of those old castles which speak eloquently, though silently, of the feudal past. One evening while the fisherman was applying himself to ply is arduous calling, a strolling beggar woman, accompanied by her little daughter, tapped at his cottage door, and was admitted by his wife. She made herself at home, and, by her frequent reference to the woman's relatives, the vagrant rapidly gained upon the affections of Crow's wife. The mysterious visitor then began to speak of the "good people" — the fairies—and into the ear of her over credulous listener she poured the most extravagant stories as to the boundless wealth to which *she* knew Crow's relatives were heirs! The fisherman returned, and his wife introduced to him this strange woman who had told her all about their distant people, and the poor man received, as eagerly as his widfe had done, the tales of the splendid fortunes which lay in store for them. The accurate description of his absent relatives by the wandering gipsey gained for her most extravagant stories implicit confidence, and for several weeks the woman and her daughter were fed on the daintiest food until poor Crow found himself very much a loser. As the stranger promised to make him one day, and that very soon, a wealthy man, Crow willingly plunged himself and his family still more deeply into debt. At length the time came for him to be raised from comparative poverty to enormous wealth, and Crow was enriched after the following manner!— We have already stated that an old castle stood not very remote from the old man's cottage. It was the fabled repository of long-hidden treasures; and, though many people had sought in vain to disinter the gold which was secreted there, as tradition stated, it remained for the poor fisherman of Dungarvan bay to break the spell, and discver the wealth buried 'neath the crumbling ruin! Norry, "the fairy doctor," acting as the enchantress. The plan of operation was that, before the witching hour of night, Crow and his son and herself were to proceed to the old castle, the young man carrying a new travelling bag; they were to utter not a word on the way, and, having gained their destination, the two men were to dig in a certain spot she would point out. It was a dark and dismal night when they left on their strange journey, and in breathless silence they reached the old castle, where Norry began jumbling her mysterious incantations, gesticulating violently. In the darkest corner of the ruin she pointed out the spot where the gold was to be dug for, and there they set to work, and toiled on with only the light of a farthing candle, until they got about six feet down, when Norry beckoned them to stop immediately, and retire outside the castle. They obeyed her, and while they were absent she lifted into the travelling bag — for which poor Crow had paid four shillings and sixpence at Mr. Orr's hardware establishment in Dungarvan — a large lump of "goold?" She closed the bag, locked it, and flung away the key. The Crow's were then bidden inside, and, with strict caution that the bag should not be opened until the young man brought it to Dublin, she commissioned him to forthwith proceed to that city to convert the treasure into sovereigns at the Bank. The poor dupe had to beg and borrow in order to raise the price of the fare to the metropolis; and at last he scraped sufficient together, went to Dublin, and waited upon the governor or chief cashier. The story seems incredible, but it has all formed a chapter of real life, and stands recorded in the annals of the quarter sessions for the county of Waterford! The young man entered the office (if we are to believe his own letter, produced in court), and whispered to the bank official that he had a lump of gold, which he wished to convert into cash.The gentleman thus addressed looked at the boy, and, suspecting it was some treasuretrove, asked him to produce the bullion. Crow carefully closed the door and cut open the bag; when, lo! there was a great lump of a stone!! The imagimnation must paint the scene!—The manager naturally thought he was in the presence of a madman, and sent for the police;—a warrant was obtained, and we believe Crow was conveyed to a lunatic asylum, to repent his folly at his leisure. The story was noised abroad, and it reached the ears of a medical gentleman, a resident of Dungarvan, then staying with a friend in Dublin. Knowing the poor fisherman of Abbeyside and his family well, he enquired further into the matter, had an interview with the supposed lunatic, learned how he had been duped, and ultimately contrived his release from the asylum. Crow would not return home, fearing the ridicule that certainly awaited him, and but he wrote to his father, described all his adventures, and, amongst other matters, told him that "the *thing* he knew was a paving-stone!" This letter was read, as we have stated, in open court, at the witch's subsequent trial, and it convulsed the jury, and the entire assemblage with laughter. The recollection of that scene has been revivied by the extraordinary revelations at the trial, on Wednesday, of the Carrick Witch, who seems to have learned her craft from this audacious imposter, who, we should mention, was also sentenced to a year's imprisonment and hard labour. Mary Doheny was present in court all through that trial, and was there in charge of Coustable Goulden, of this town, as a witness in a prosecution brought against a prisoner for stealing a firkin of butter from Mr. Mulcahy, J.P.,of Ballymakee.

```

Thus far, I have only found a single report of that case, which had perhaps become somewhet embellished in the way it was (mis)remembered in the decade since it had occurred.

DUNGARVAN QUARTER SESSIONS

EXTRAORDINARY CASE — GOLD DIGGING.

Margaret and Sarah Murphy were charged John Crowe of Abbey side, Dungarvan, with feloniously taking one pair of shoes, one pair of stockings, and several other articles of wearing apparel belonging to his daughter, on the 22d Sept. last.

Mr. Barron brought before the court, in a facetious manner, that this case was linked with one of the most extraordinary acts, he might say of necromancy or magic, which has ever occurred in the county Waterford, or perhaps in Ireland. It appears that this ingenious piece of imposition had been practised and carried out effectually by the prisoners at the bar, and so far worked their part on the simplicity and credulity of John Crowe and family that they actually believed the statement to be quite correct. Some time since prisoners called to the house of Crowe and informed him that there had been some hidden treasures at the Abbeyside old castle, which was destined for no other persons except Crowe's family (great laughter). From this information Crowe and his son-in-law seemed to be captivated in pondering over the crocks of gold they were in a short time to possess (laughter). The prisoners then accompanied the old Crowe and the young goose (the son-in-law being a tailor) to the wished-for spot, and of course commenced operations to seek for that much admired metal (laughter). They found it, and carefully rolled it up in a white cloth, placed it in a travelling bag purchased in town for the purpose, and given to Crowe's son-in-law, who was fully commissioned to make sale of it in Dublin (laughter). On his arrival in Dublin to make sale of the gold, I believe it would be morally impossible to describe his joy in thinking of his easily acquired wealth and independence; but when he examined the contents of the bag he found about 30lbs weight of a stone (roars of laughter). Now gentlemen I shall read for you the communication which has been received from him to his father-in-law, John Crowe, and it is then for you to judge for yourselves:

[At the reading of this classic production it is impossible to describe with any sort of accuracy the side-splitting laughter which pervaded the whole court during the time Mr. Barron was stating the case. The following is verbatim copy of the letter:

"Dublin, September 25, 1853  
"Dear Sir— This is to inform you that we arrived here on saturday Night about 10 o'clock I am sorry to inform you that we were disapiointed in what you no. i was surprised on Sunday Morning when i opened me Bag and found nothing but a large stone i was surprised when i looked at it Mary an I were Near Dropping in the room when we saw it here we are now in a Bad state Don't know what to do in the wide world we are also fretting A Bout ye not nowing But ye would Be Robbed of all ye have in the house what will we do at all we are going to Liverpool tomorrow with a Bear pocket and trouble mind But there is No help for it — keep up your courage it is No use to Be fretting no more at present from JOHN CRANAGE Read this yourself  
"To Mr John Crowe, Abbeyside.

Mr. John Crowe was called to state his complaint against the prisoners—he was sworn, and stated that the prisoner Margaret Murphy called into his house and told him and his son-in-law, John Crannage, that there was great riches for them Abbeyside Old Castle (great laughter).

Court—Did yon go there with the party?

Witness—Begor I did so gintlemen (great laughter)

Court—Why did you go?

Witness—O, to be sure to get the money (laughter).

Court— Did she promise you the gold was there?

Witness—Begor she did and no mistake (great laughter). Though I went there with them, I knew there was none, but went to please the party (great laughter).

Court—You must be a silly man to be guided by such a person?

Witness—Begor I was the sufferer myself, I gave £1 19s. 4d. to my son-in-law, to carry him to Dublin, to sell the gold, but since I got the letter from him, it turned out to be 30lb of a large stone —(roars of laughter)—and in addition, she stole shoes and stockings, and my daughter's clothes (great laughter).

Court—Did you think that you would be very rich?

Witness—No, because we got letter it was a stone (laughter).

Here the witness entered into minute details, how the prisoner and her daughter effected the robbery, and was most laughable, which commanded the attention of the court for some time.

Sarah Crannage was next called as witness—Stated that the prisoner called into her house on the 22nd September, and told her that there was a great treasure hidden in Abbeyside Old Castle, which would raise her and her whole family, if she would keep secret (great laughter).

Witness—I said would there be any harm in going for it?

Prisoner said not at all, it would worse to have it hid there in such bad times, and so many wanting it (great laughter).

Witness—I believed she was telling the truth, as she (the prisoner) said it was for the family of the Crowes, and no other person could get it.

Court—Did you suppose that you would be very rich in the course of a short time after hearing such intelligence?

Witness—I did think so until I go f the letter from my husband (John Crannage), from Dublin, and then I knew the gold was a large stone (roars of laughter).

Court—So your fancied riches at once changed into a stone?

Witness—indeed it did, for which I am sorry —(great laughter)— my husband went to Dublin to sell it, and my sister too.

Court—Did they sell the gold?

Witness—O no, it turned out to be a stone (roars of laughter.)

Court—Did the prisoner effect the robbery with which you charge her?

Witness—I lent them the shawl, the frock, the apron, &c., &c., to appear someway decent to go to mass, but instead of that they ran away towards Waterford, and my poor old father aged about 60 years, had to strip off his shoes and hat and follow them through the country with a red handkerchief on his head, crying out stop the thief, but the people thought he was cracked (roars of laughter).

Father—Yes, I paid shilling to boy to follow them when I got tired myself—(roars of laughter) and when he brought them back I knew them right well, and so I ought, they destroyed and killed me (great laughter).

Witness—The prisoner (Margaret Murphy), also stole 7s. 6d. in my house, from us at the time they went off with my clothes.

The Constable produced the property stolen which was identified by the witness.

His Worship after recapitulating the most extraordinary acts of the imposter sentenced Margaret Murphy to 4 years penal imprisonment, and her young daughter the other prisoner at the bar to 12 months imprisonment. Here the laughable scene closed.

Mary Doheny's case also attracted some commentary from a wider cultural perspective.

The *Morning News* referring to the conviction of Mary Doheny for witchcraft at Carrick-on-Suir says: "We will not say that Mrs. Mary Doheny did not deserve the punishment to which Mr. Sergeant Howley has condemned her. She was decidedly behind the age. It is too late in the day now to talk of bestowing creature comforts on "spirits." Public taste or public credulity tends in a different direction. To shy a guitar at a man's head, to knot and unloosen a rope, to rap on a table, or draw a person up by his hair, are the sort of manifestations which it is correct to believe in at present. Spirits may do all these things, but they never eat, nor do they ever return to their former friends to look for second hand clothing. Mrs Doheny was but a stupid practitioner, and she deserves the full force of her sentence, if it were only for ignorance of the received notions of spiritualism."

WITCHCRAFT

(From the *Globe*.)

When we read that Mary Doheny, "Carrick Witch," is told from the Bench that she "is a terrible woman and a dangerous impostor," and sentenced to twelve months' imprisonment with hard labour, we are almost led to think what might be the best means of treating the Brothers Davenport, and the whole herd of spiritualist impostors with their impudent and mendacious *chaperons*. It is impossible to deny that Mary Doheny has some reason to complain, for during the long period for which she destined to suffer confinement, with poor diet and hard work, numberless *seances* will no doubt be given, at which the British Folly will be more or less numerously represented, and for which the British sovereign will be liberally poured forth to the aggrandizement of the spiritualists, and possibly with no disadvantage to those upon whose respectable recommendation the public gives them audience. Mary Doheny aimed at bringing the dead to life again, not merely in their spiritual essence, but to all appearances corporeally and in the shape in which they had their material being. What is more, she succeeded to the satisfaction of at least some of her audience. One woman, who was examined as a witness against her, swore that she used to see her dead father, and other dead members of her family in the moat at Ballydine, and several letters were received purporting to come from the deceased relatives.—The prisoner said she wanted bread, butter, and tea for the people in the moat, and these were daily supplied during four months. The witness also fancied that she saw her own deceased father. "He was sitting in a chair opposite the door—quite near her, having on a blue coat, knee-breeches, and a hat. He said three times he was going, and that he would return with plenty; and the prisoner said he was going with 'the gentry,' but would return." Since her arrest there was no appearance from the other world. The husband of this woman, a sub-constable, also deposed that he saw and knew his father-in-law, who was only twenty yards from him. "He believed that the man had come to life, and thought he had a ghostly appearance. He never saw a dead man standing before. He saw his son also in an empty house where he was brought by the prisoner. He, too, had a ghostly appearance, and had not the shape of a living person, and the prisoner stated that it would take a considerable time for him to come to perfection." If, instead of having to account for these things before Sergeant Howley and a Clonmel jury, on a charge of fraudently obtaining goods, Mary Doheny could perform her tricks in a London drawingroom before a number of gentlemen, distinguished or not distinguished, she would probably have a good prosperous season, and an ample supply of palpable bottled spirits above proof, instead of twelve months' hard labour in Clonmel gaol.

## Aftermath

Mary Doheny's story does not quite end there, though, appearing, along with the name by which she was better known — the *Carrick Witch* — in occasional press reports for several more years to come.

The pseudo witch, on applying for permission to take her discharge, betrayed evident symptoms of uneasiness, as some of the guardians began to put questions to her as to her previous residence, antecedents, &c., and the suggestive word "Carrick," with its world of associations of the verdant and gullible, was stated by Mary as the last residence she occupied previous to her two years change of air in the county gaol.

She stated to the board that her husband, a blind man, earned his living by selling paper in Clonmel, and it will be remembered that the blind husband, in the days of Mary's acknowledged sway, not only over the living, but also over the dead, playing an important part in the nefarious plot, so widely and successfully developed by the Carrick witch, by sitting in a waste house, dressed in sheet and shroud, and representing the ghost of some departed persons, whose anxious relatives were answered as many questions they choose to put to the blind ghost about the fate of their deceased friends and relatives. Food, money and other material comforts usually required by the inhabitants of this "earth of ours" were said by the sheeted and shrouded blind ghost to be as much needed in the "land of the leal," and forthwith, money, eggs, tea, and other creature comforts, which were supplied in abundance in a dressed state, had to be presented in a raw and unprepared state at the fairy rath at Ballydine, as deceased got tired of this state of things, and wished, like ordinary mortals, for change of diet, said change being much a better busness in Mary's line than the prepared matters in the bills of gastronomy.

Tipperary Free Press - Friday 09 July 1869

GRIEVOUS ASSAULT — TEETH KNOCKED OUT.

A pensioner in the 19th Hussars named William O'Donnell, was charged with assaulting woman named Mary Doheny in New-street the 1st inst.

O'Donnell was also charged with assaulting a young girl named Margaret St. John, in the same house and on same occasion.

The defendant pleaded not guilty, and was defended by Mr. O'Donohoe.

The complainant in the previous case is the noborions Carrick witch, whose mediumistic manifestations with the spirit world, some four years ago on behalf of a police constable, who wished to hold communication with his deceased friends, were as wonderful and remarkable as those of the renowned Home.

Complainant deposed that on the night in question she was out picking water cresses and on her return to her home she found the defendant with a boy, named Lar O'Donnell drinking some beer which they had sent out for, at the fire. At about 10 o'clock when the beer was drank she said to O'Donnell that there was no person stopping in the house but two lone women and that he should get up and go to his lodgings. He then took hold of the girl St. John, and commenced taking improper liberties with her when she witness interfered he hit her with his fist and knocked out one of her teeth and loosened two more. Witness exhibited the gap occasioned in the front of her mouth by the loss of her tooth, and in further corroboration produced the displaced tooth rolled up in a piece paper. The two adjoining ones were quite loose and ready to fall out at any moment.

The witness was humourously examined by Mr. O'Donohue with reference to her commnnications with the spirit world and the Ballydine post-office at the Rath from which place she represented to the duped police constable that all her communications concerning his deceased friends were forwarded.

Complainant's husband a blind man who occupied a seat in the gallery loudly protested against the bench for allowing his consort to be badgered in such a manner about a by-gone transaction, and had to be removed from court.

Margaret St. John, on being sworn, stated O'Donnell, on the night in question attempted to take improper liberties with her, and on previous witness interfering he struck her in the mouth and knocked out one of her teeth. He then caught her by the hair of the head and struck her several times.

The defendant pleaded guilty to this assault.

For the offence he was sentenced pay £2 and 2s costs, or in default three months' imprisonment with hard labor. For the second assault he was sentenced 5s and costs or one week's imprisonment.

And then a few years later on, she would also appear as a witness in another case of violence:

She regularly paid for minding her little charge, but now that the woman had become sick, and could not mind the child, she sought to have the little one admitted to the workhouse.

Mr. O'Halloran said that he knew the father to be a most respectable farmer, and if the application were granted he was sure that they could recover, and would be paid for, the child's support.
