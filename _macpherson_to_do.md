## Macpherson's Songs

Jamie Macpherson's songs are variously described — the Lament, the Farewell, the Rant — but there are just two: the Farewell and the Rant both relate to the same song. If we need a third, we should might go with *Macpherson's Lament* and *Macpherson's Rant*, and then add Robert Burns' *McPherson's Farewell* to the set.

Lament - ostenisbly writen by Jamie Macpherson; then rewritten as the Farewell.. are the tunes the same? or different?

The first is *Macpherson's Lament*, opens with the fantastic line, *I've spent my time in rioting*. The second, *Macpherson's Farewell*, also referred to as *Macpherson's Rant*, has a compelling chorus:

*Sae rantingly, sae wantonly,*  
*Sae dauntingly gae'd he,*  
*He play'd a spring, and danced it round,*  
*Below the gallows tree.*

The earliest reference I can find to the lament is in [Scotish Songs, in Two Volumes: Volume the Second](https://digital.nls.uk/special-collections-of-printed-music/archive/90265294), published in 1794, pp. 114-7:

```{admonition} Macpherson's Lament, 1794

I've spent my time in rioting,  
Debauch'd my health and strength;  
I've pillag'd, plunder'd, murdered,  
But now, alas! at length,  
I'm borught to punishment direct,  
Pale Death draws near to me;  
This end I never did project,  
To hang upon a tree.

To hang upon a tree! a tree!
That curs'd unhappy death!  
Like to a wolf to worried be  
And choaked in the breath.  
My very heart would surely break,  
When this I think upon,  
Did not my courage singular,  
Bid pensive thoughts begone.

No man on earth that draweth breath  
More courage had than I;  
I dar'd my foes unto their face,  
And would not from them fly:  
This grandeur stout, I did keep out,  
Like Hector manfullie;  
Then wonder one like me, so stout,  
Should hang upon a tree.

Th' Egyptian band I did command,  
With courage more by far  
Than ever did a general  
His soldiers in a war:  
Being fear'd by all, both great and small,  
I liv'd most joyfullie;  
O! curse upon ths fate of mine,  
To hang upon a tree!

To part with life I am content,  
As any heretofore,  
Herefore, good people, all take heed,  
This warning take by me,  
According to the lives you lead,  
Rewarded you will be.

The words of Macpherson's Farewell are Burns', the tune is Macpherson's rant.

Macpherson's Farewell (aka Macpherson's Rant)

Farewell, ye dungeons dark and strong,  
The wretch's destinie,  
MacPherson's time will not be long,  
On yonder gallows tree.  
Sae rantingly, sae wantonly,  
Sae dauntingly gae'd he,  
He play'd a spring, and danced it round,  
Below the gallows tree.

Oh, what is death but parting breath!
On many a bloody plain

Untie these bands from off my hands,  
And bring to me my sword;

MACPHERSON'S FAREWELL.

BURNS.

Tune: Macpherson's Rant.

FAREWEIL, ye prisons dark and strong,

The wretch's destinie !  
Macpherson's time will not be long  
On yonder gallows tree.

Sae rantingly, sae wantonly,

Sae dantonly gaed he,  
He play'd a spring, and danced it round,  
Beneath the gallows tree !

Oh, what is death, but parting breath ?

On mony a bluidy plain  
I've daur'd his face, and in this place

I scorn him yet again.

Untie these bands frae aff my hands,

And bring to me my sword ;  
And there's nae man in a' Scotland

But I'll brave him at a word.  

I've lived a life of sturt and strife ;  

I die by treacherie :  
It burns my heart I must depart,

And not avenged be.

Now fareweil, light, thou sunshine bright,

And all beneath the sky !  
May coward shame distain his name,

The wretch that dares not die I *

* The story of Macpherson is thus detailed by a person signing himself B. G., New Monthly Magazine, vol. I. p. 142 : " James Macpherson was born of a beautiful gipsy, who, at a great wedding, attracted the notice of a half-intoxicated Highland gentleman. He acknowledged the child, and had him reared in his house, until he lost his life in bravely pursuing a hostile clan, to recover a spreach of cattle taken from Badenoch. The gipsy woman, hearing of this disaster, in her rambles the following summer, came and took away her boy ; but she often returned with him, to wait upon his relations and clansmen, who never failed to clothe him well, besides giving money to his mother. He grew up to beauty, strength, and stature, rarely equalled. His sword is still preserved at Duff House, a rescience of the Earl of Fife, and few men of our day could carry, far less 
wield it, as a weapon of war ; and if it must be owned that his prowess was

MACPHERSON'S RANT. 

I'VE spent my time in rioting, 

Debauch'd my health and strength ; 

I've pillaged, plunder'd, murdered, 
But now, alas, at length, 

I'm brought to punishment direct ; 
Pale death draws near to me ; 

debased by the exploits of a free-booter, it is certain, no act of cruelty, no robbery of the widow, the fatherless, or distressed, and no murder, were ever perpetrated under his command. He often gave the spoils of the rich to relieve the poor ; and all his tribe were restrained from many atrocities of rapine by the awe of his mighty arm. Indeed, it is said that a dispute with an aspiring and savage man of his tribe, who wished to rob a gentleman's house while his wife and two children lay on the bier for interment, was the cause of his being betrayed to the vengeance of the law. The Magistrates of Aberdeen were exasperated at Macphersqn's escape, and bribed a girl in that city to allure and deliver him into their hands. There is a platform before the jail, at the top of a stair, and a door below. When Macpherson's capture was made known to his comrades by the frantic girl, who had been so credulous as to believe the magistrates only wanted to hear the wonderful performer on the violin, his cousin, Donald Macpherson, a gentleman of Herculean powers, did not disdain to come from Badenoch, and to join a gipsy, Peter Brown, in liberating the prisoner. On a market-day they brought several assistants ; and swift horses were stationed at a convenient distance. Donald Macpherson and Peter Brown forced the jail ; and while Peter Brown went to help the heavily-fettered. James Macpherson in moving away, Donald Macpherson guarded the jail-door with a drawn sword. Many persons assembled at the market had experienced James Macpherson's humanity, or had shared his bounty ; and they crowded round the jail as in mere curiosity, but, in fact, to obstruct the civil authorities in their attempts to prevent a rescue. A butcher, however, was resolved to detain Macpherson, expecting a large recompense from the magistrates : he sprung up the stairs, and leaped from the platform upon Donald Macpherson, whom he dashed to the ground by the force and weight of his body. Donald Macpherson soon recovered, to make a desperate resistance ; and the combatants tore off each other's clothes. The butcher got a glimpse of his dog upon the platform, and called him to his aid : but Macpherson, with admirable presence of mind, snatched up his own plaid, which lay near, and threw it over the butcher, thus misleading the instinct of his canine adversary. The dog darted with fury upon the plaid, and terribly lacerated his master's thigh. In the meantime, James Maepherson had been carried out by Peter Brown, and was soon joined by Donald Macpherson, who was quickly covered by some friendly spectator with a hat and great-coat. The magistrates ordered webs from the shops to be drawn across the Gallowgate ; but Donald Macpherson cut them asunder with his sword, and James, the late prisoner, got off on horseback. He was, some time after, betrayed by a man of his own tribe ; and was the last person executed at Banff, previous to the abolition of hereditable jurisdiction. He was an admirable performer on the violin; and his talent for composition is still evidenced by Macpherson's Rant, and Macpherson's Pibroch. He performed these tunes at the foot of the fatal tree ; and then asked if he had any friend in the crowd to whom a last gift of his instrument would be acceptable. No man had hardihood to claim friendship with a delinquent, in whose crimes the acknowledgment might implicate an avowed acquaintance. As no friend came forward, Macpherson said, the companion of so many gloomy hours should perish with him ; and, breaking the violin over his knee, he threw away the fragments. Donald Macpherson picked up the neck of the violin, which to this day is preserved, as a valuable memento, by the family of Cluny, chieftain of the Macphersons."

The old ballad, for which Burns substituted the above beautiful verses, is given, in continuation, from Herd's Collection of Scottish Songs [1776.]

76 

This end I never did project, 
To hang upon a tree. 

To hang upon a tree, a tree ! 

That cursed unhappy death ! 
Like to a wolf, to worried be, 

And choaked in the breath. 
My very heart wad surely break 

When this I think upon, 
Did not my courage singular 

Bid pensive thoughts begone. 

No man on earth, that draweth breath, 

More courage had than I ; 
I dared my foes unto their face, 

And would not from them fly. 
This grandeur stout I did keep out, 

Like Hector, manfully ; 
Then wonder one like me so stout 

Should hang upon a tree. 

The Egyptian band I did command, 

With courage more by far, 
Than ever did a general 

His soldiers in the war. 
Being fear'd by all, both great and small, 

I lived most joyfullie : 
Oh, curse upon this fate of mine, 

To hang upon a tree ! 

As for my life I do not care, 

If justice would take place, 
And bring my fellow-plunderers 

Unto the same disgrace. 
But Peter Brown, that notour loun, 

Escaped, and was made free : 
Oh, curse upon this fate of mine, 

To hang upon a tree ! 

Both law and justice buried are, 
And fraud and guile succeed ; 

The guilty pass unpunished, 
If money intercede. 



77 

The Laird of Grant, that Highland saunt, 

His mighty majestic, 
He pleads the cause of Peter Brown, 

And lets Macpherson die. 

The destiny of my life, contrived 

By those whom I obliged, 
Rewarded me much ill for good, 

And left me no refuge. 
But Braco Duff, in rage enough, 

He first laid hands on me ; 
And if that death would not prevent, 

Avenged would I be. 

As for my life, it is but short, 

When I shall be no more ; 
To part with life I am content, 

As any heretofore. 
Therefore, good people all, take heed, 

This warning take by me, 
According to the lives you lead, 

Rewarded you shall be.

MACPHERSON'S RANT.

This ballad, worthy of a hangman's pen, was first printed in Herd's *Scottish Songs*, i. 161. It is found, mutilated and altered, with the title of *Macpherson's Lament*, in the *Thistle of Scotland*, p. 52.

The story of Macpherson is given as follows by a writer in the *New Monthly Magazine*, voL i. p. 142, cited by Chambers, *Scottish Songs*, i. 84.

"James Macpherson was bom of a beautiful gipsy, who, at a great wedding, attracted the notice of a half-intoxicated Highland gentleman.

He grew up to beauty, strength, and stature, rarely equalled.

Burns's magnificent death-song, *McPherson's Farewell*, is too well known to require more than an allusion.

I've spent my time in rioting,  
Debauch'd my health and strength;  
I've pillag'd, plundered, murdered,  
But now, alas ! at length,  
I'm brought to punishment direct.  
Pale death draws near to me ;  
This end I never did project,  
To hang upon a tree.

To hang upon a tree ! a tree !  
That curs'd unhappy death !  
Like to a wolf to worried be,  
And choaked in the breath.  
My very heart would surely break,  
When this I think upon,  
Did not my courage singular  
Bid pensive thoughts begone.

No man on earth that draweth breath,  
More courage had than I ;  
I dar'd my foes unto their face,  
And would not from them fly.  
This grandeur stout, I did keep out,  
Like Hector, manfullie :  
Then wonder one like me, so stout,

I liv'd most joyfullie :  
A curse upon this fate of mine,  
To hang upon a tree !

As for my life, I do not care,  
If justice would take place.  
And bring my fellow plunderers  
Unto this same disgrace.  
For Peter Brown, that notour loon,  
Escap'd and was made free ;  
O I curse upon this fate of mine.  
To hang upon a tree !

Both law and justice buried are,  
And fraud and guile succeed;  
The guilty pass unpunished,  
If money intercede.  
The Laird of Grant, that Highland saint,  
His mighty majestie.  
He pleads the cause of Peter Brown,  
And lets Macpherson die.

The destiny of my life, contriv'd  
By those whom I oblig'd,  
Rewarded me much ill for good,  
And left me no refuge.
For Braco Duff, in rage enough,  
He first laid hands on me ;  
And if that death would not preyent,  
Avenged would I be.

As for my life, it is but short,  
When I shall be no more ;

Death of Singing Jamie
On gallows, played "A lovesong for Mary Gordon" (better know as Macpherson's rant)
On death of father, because of illegitimacy, distant cousin became laird.

Bought horses in the Highlands and sold them in Northern Lowlands.

Lawbreakers as sorners: stayed witout ermission in farmers' empty barns and outhouses in winter. But Jamie payed rent, and good music.

[Alexander Duff, Lord of Braco]

Farmhouse, one night; Jamie heard scream, opened door, young farm girl molested [Mary Gordon], Braco drunkenly there. Fight between Braco's men and Jamie, Jamie bests Braco, sends him away humiliated.

Braco goes to Nicholas Dunbar, hereditary Sherriff of Banffshire, warrant for arrest issued for sorning. Jamie waylaid messenger with warrant, stole it. Dunbar declares him an outlaw.

Jamie stays wth Laird of Invereshie (cousin). Clans would often go raiding; Jamie joins Donald Macpherson on a raid (?the Laird?), gets caught. Escapes. Continues to meet Mary Gordon. Flaunts local lord, sorning again. States he will parade in Aberdeen. His piper, Jamie Brown, leads the the way. Cheering mob. Arrested. Shut in Tolbooth, Braco Duff informed to take him back to Banff but jurisdiction issue as Jamie no crime in that area; continues to be held, even as Braco wants to take him back to Banff.

Jamie's mother tells Jamie Brown to ride to get help from Invereshie - 3 days; returns with Donald Macpherson (now fifth day after arrest). but Sherriff had authorised release of Jamie to Braco for the following day. Brown broke into council chambers to rescue Jamies sword displayed there.

Jamie throws plaid over sleeping jailer's head, steal keys; turnkey is calling in alarm. Escape.

Jamie wanted to go to America with Mary, reckless last trip round Banffshire town of Keith, fair of St Rufus. Braco there, captures Jamie; tried for sorning, sentenced to death. Laird of Invereshie fought for his reprieve. Visited in jail w/ Mary, Jamie gave them words and music for his rant.

Asked to play violin one last time (rant); offered violin to anyone who would take it, none came forward, broke it over his knee. Hung. Some time later, a reprieve arrived. Mary Gordon, in grief, and news a reprieve had been given, wandered crazy clutching manuscript.

Macpherson's Lament

Starts with gipsy woman in caravan dropping off her son at Macpherson Hall where the boy's father will bring him up.

Lord Macpherson brings up the child, teaches him to fight; gifted violinst; everyone except the cripple would dance to his tune; hardest heart softened by melancholy of his laments.

Aged 15, father tells him his mother was a gipsy.

Aged 17, Fraser clan steal cattle, Lord Macpherson gives chase, falls from horse and dies. Instrcuts that Jamie be taken care of/wants for nothing.

Three days later, gipsy caravn arrives. Jamie had been feeling lost, but feels his true way is on the road.

Mother lives in a cave in the mountain, leads a band of gipsy outlaws.

Lord Macpherson's land given to relatives and deserving servants, Jamie leaves it all behind, taking just his swrod and violin with him.

Learned the ways of the outlaw; took over from mother; prevented murder.

?plays rant?

"Aberdeenshire freebooter." Looked after the poor, gold coins on the doorstep of a poor farmer.

Prevented men from robbing a castle occupied by woman and her daughter while father was at a funeral. One of gang informed on him: arrested. Due to be hung; a large crowd gathered, suddenly, door open: "run". Local butcher (who was the hangman) jumped on one of men, called hs dog over, but in melee,  plaid thrown over butcher and dog attacked its owner. Escaped on horses.

Met a girl, dishevelled, limping, whose horse had thrown her. Gave her a lift (daughter of a farmer/landowner). Meet again? Not here. Meeting place; met, played violin. Suggested eloping. Jamie had raid to go on. A young man hidden in bushes heard them; time of next meeting, girl accosted by her father, sent home; Jmaie caught.  Lord Braco of Kilbride.

Imprisoned; no charges of bloodshed;  but theft enough.

?played lament?

Last request: play fiddle. Played it, asked who would take fiddle and play it at his wake. No-one dared be seen as associate of his, so he broke violin; and was hanged.

Fiddler's Farewell: The Legend of the Hanged Fiddler
D. K. Wilgus
But who was the 25-year old who met his end on a gallows in Banff on November 16, 1700 and why was he accused of being an Egyptian?

Macpherson was a 'dykesider', the term for an illegitimate Laird's offspring in the North East of Scotland. He was born as the result of a liaison between his father, Macpherson of Invereshie, and a traveller girl after they met at a wedding. He was raised in his father's house until Macpherson senior's untimely death whereupon his mother reclaimed him but he always remained on good terms with both sides of his family.

He was said to cut quite a dash and was "in beauty, strength and stature rarely equalled." He was a legendary swordsman and a gifted fiddler. To what extent his attributes have been exaggerated in the telling – we'll never know. But he does seem to have been a charismatic figure and attracted a band of traveller followers who paid scant regard to the law.

Macpherson and his men targetted rich lairds and wealthy farmers and seem to have enjoyed some support from local folk. Eventually they became so emboldened that their entry to towns on market days would be preceded by a piper. His reign of robbery, mayhem and terror extended across Aberdeenshire in the market towns of Keith, Forres, Banff and Elgin but finally incurred the displeasure of Lord Duff of Braco who made several attempts to capture Macpherson. On one occasion he was detained but was freed by his brother who was assisted by the populace of Aberdeen.

He was finally captured by Duff and his men at the Saint Rufus Fair in Keith. Macpherson's men put up stiff resistance and one of them was killed. But Duff prevailed and Macpherson was taken to the tolbooth in Banff under heavy guard.

In 1609, the Scottish Parliament passed an act against Romani groups known as the "Act against the Egyptians", which made it lawful to condemn, detain and execute Gypsies if they were known or reputed to be ethnically Romani.

It was not the most enlightened piece of legislation and the sentencing statement made at Macpherson's trial makes interesting reading:

"Forasmeikle as you James Macpherson, pannal, are found guilty by ane verdict of ane assyse, to be knoun, holden, and repute to be Egiptian and a wagabond, and oppressor of his Magesties free lieges in ane bangstrie manner, and going up and down the country armed, and keeping mercats in ane hostile manner, and that you are a thief, and that you are of pessimae famae. Therfor, the Sheriff-depute of Banff, and I in his name, adjudges and discernes you the said James Macpherson to be taken to the Cross of Banff, from the tolbooth thereof, where you now lye, and there upon ane gibbet to be erected, to be hanged by the neck to the death by the hand of the common executioner, upon Friday next, being the 16th day of November instant, being a public weekly mercat day, betwixt the hours of two and three in the afternoon...."

In the run up to his execution Macpherson composed his famous 'Rant' and Duff is said to have ordered the Banff clock to be put forward to thwart a reprieve that was on its way. Macpherson sang his lament on the gallows and smashed his fiddle before meeting his fate.

A legend was born and Robert Burns was instrumental in developing the cult of Macpherson with his rewrite of the famous rant:

Farewell, ye dungeons dark and strong,
The wretch's destinie!
McPherson's time will not be long,
On yonder gallows-tree.

Sae rantingly, sae wantonly,
Sae dauntingly gaed he;
He play'd a spring, and danc'd it round,
Below the gallows-tree.

O what is death but parting breath?
On many a bloody plain
I've dar'd his face, and in this place
I scorn him yet again!

Untie these bands from off my hands,
And bring me to my sword;
And there's no a man in all Scotland,
But I'll brave him at a word.

I've liv'd a life of sturt and strife;
I die by treacherie:
It burns my heart I must depart,
And not avenged be.

Now farewell light, thou sunshine bright,
And all beneath the sky!
May coward shame distain his name,
The wretch that dares not die!

Sae rantingly, sae wantonly,
Sae dauntingly gaed he;
He play'd a spring, and danc'd it round,
Below the gallows-tree.

THe Clock that hung macpherson

Anyone visiting Dufftown or looking into the history of its Clock Tower will come across a story that is told many times about James Macpherson, a Highland Freebooter, who got hanged in Banff in 1700. According to the folklore tale that's told today the clock that was set forward was removed from the Banff tower and transferred to the Clock Tower in Dufftown. But, in an 1878[\[1\]](#_ftn1) journal the following text can be found: "It is said that his death was hurried on by the Magistrates, and that they also caused the messenger entrusted with a reprieve to be stopped by the way, in consequence of which acts of injustice it is alleged the town of Banff was deprived of the power of trying and executing malefactors". There's no mention of a clock being set forward. Also, when reading through all the documents, there's no mention of a clock being transferred from Banff to the Dufftown Clock Tower. If the clock was indeed transferred, and knowing the Clock Tower was built in 1839, it was after more than 139 years the clock was installed. As we learned in a previous chapter the first clock was installed in the 1850's. This original clock had a black face and has been replaced in the past years, making the story very unlikely.  
  
After some research I have been able to locate the real clock. If you want to find out more about the 'Clock That Hung Macpherson', [click here](https://dufftown.info/2022/05/10/real-jamie-macpherson-story/).

Figure: Drawing of the Sword [**\[2\]**](https://dufftown.info/wp-admin/post.php?post=1038&action=edit#_ftn2)

The Freebooter
--------------

James Macpherson was born, the illegitimate son of a Scottish Laird and a gypsy girl, in 1675.  He was a well-known freebooter and outlaw around the north of Scotland, and particularly in the Moray area, towards the end of the 17th century.  James (Jamie) Macpherson was a man of magnificent stature, strength and intellect. He excelled in war and was the best fiddle player and the best swordsman of his name. He led a band of Gypsies who terrorised the landed gentry around the Moray area and he earned a reputation as a Scottish Robin Hood by stealing from the wealthy and sharing the spoils with the less fortunate. Tradition asserts that, if it must be owned that his prowess was debased by the exploits of a freebooter, no act of cruelty, no robbery of the widow, the fatherless, or the distressed, and no murder were ever perpetrated under his command or by his knowledge.

Jamie was finally captured in Keith in Moray by a posse organised by his arch enemy, Lord Duff of Braco.  He may have escaped if a woman had not thrown a blanket over him from an upstairs window. Because of the blanket he couldn't see where he was going and tripped over a stone in the grave yard. He was then captured and taken to Banff Jail.

Prosecution of James Macpherson[**\[3\]**](#_ftn3)
--------------------------------------------------

James Macpherson, the two Browns, and James Gordon, were brought before the sheriff of Banffshire at Banff, on the 7th of November 1700, charged with 'being habit and repute Egyptians and vagabonds and keeping the markets in their ordinary manner of thieving and purse-cutting' … being guilty also of masterful violence and oppression.' A procurator appeared on the part of the young Laird of Grant, demanding surrender of the two Browns, to be tried in the court of his regality within whose bounds they had lived and offering a pledge for them. But the demand was overruled on the ground that the Browns had never been truly lived there. Witnesses were adduced who detailed many felonies of the prisoners. They had stolen sheep, oxen, and horses. They had broken into houses and taken away goods. They had robbed men of their purses and tyrannously oppressed many poor people. It was shown that the band was in the habit of speaking a peculiar language. They often spent whole nights in dancing and debauchery, Peter Brown or Macpherson giving animation to the scene by the strains of the violin. An inhabitant of Keith related how Macpherson came to his house one day, seeking for him, when, not finding him, he stabbed the bed to make sure he was not there and, on-going away, set the ale-barrel a flowing. The jury gave a verdict against all the four prisoners, but sentence was for the mean time passed upon only Macpherson and Gordon adjudging them to be hanged next market-day.

The verdict in the original manuscript account of James MacPhersons trial

Macpherson spent the last hours of his life in composing a tune expressive of the reckless courage with which he regarded his fate. He marched to the place of execution, a mile from the town, playing this air on his violin. He even danced to it under the fatal tree. Then he asked if anyone in the crowd would accept his fiddle and keep it as a memorial of Macpherson; and finding no one disposed to do so, he broke the instrument over his knee, and "threw himself indignantly from the ladder.

Macpherson's Farewell
---------------------

_Sae rantonly, sae wantonly,  
Sae dauntingly gaed he,  
He played a spring and danced it round  
Below the gallows tree._

_I've lived a life of sturt and strife  
I die by treacherie,  
It burns my heart I must depart  
And not avenged be._

_Now farewell light thou sunshine bright,  
And all beneath the sky,  
May coward shame disdain his name  
The wretch that dares not die._

_Sae rantingly, sae wantonly,  
Sae dauntingly gaed he,  
He played a spring and danced it round  
Below the gallows tree._

It is said that his death was hurried on by the Magistrates, and that they also caused the messenger entrusted with a reprieve to be stopped by the way, in consequence of which acts of injustice it is alleged the town of Banff was deprived of the power of trying and executing malefactors. According the story that is told the people involved in moving the clock forward were punished, and for many years afterwards the clock was kept fifteen minutes fast, as a reminder of that fateful day. Still to this day the clock tower in Macduff has the clock on its western side blanked out as a gesture to the people of Banff.

One thing is certain amid all the traditions which have come down regarding this bold and singular robber; his strength and stature far exceeded those of common men; and this was proved, when his grave was opened in early 1800's, by the examination of his bones.[\[4\]](#_ftn4)

Not the first time
------------------

Before the well-known capture and prosecution James had been taken to a jail before. He was under citation to appear before the Lords of Justiciary at Inverness on a charge of having despoiled John Grant of Conygass of certain oxen, sheep, and other goods in June or July 1689, ' when Dundee was in the hills.' The Laird of Grant being sheriff of Inverness and other Grants engaged in the intended trial, Macpherson, though protesting his entire innocence, professed to have no hope of 'impartial justice' yet he appeared at the citation and was immediately committed close prisoner to the Tollbooth of Inverness where he was denied the use of pen and ink and the access of his friends. So that he 'expected nothing but a summary execution.'

James Macpherson, born 1675, was the illegitimate son of Highland laird and a gypsy woman who was raised by his father at Invereshie House near Kincraig.

Following his father's death, Jamie absorbed himself amongst his mother's folk with his life story becoming richly peppered with myth and lore. Sir Walter Scott later wrote about Macpherson and his exploits.

He is remembered as a man of magnificent stature, strength and intellect who could handle a sword as expertly as he could play a fiddle.

Some accounts record him as the leader of a band of caterans, or cow thieves, as well as a legitimate horse trader.

What is certainly known is that Macpherson was captured an hung from the clocktower at Banff in 1700 following foul play by his influential adversary with a lament he composed in the week before his execution later rewritten by Robert Burns.

The downfall of Macpherson was executed by his enemy-in-chief, Lord Duff of Braco, who had become increasingly incensed by the antics of the outlaw's armed posse as they became increasingly brazen in their deeds, often marching into towns on market day behind a piper.

Macpherson was captured on two occasions, once in Inverness and another in Aberdeen, but managed to escape both times - on one occasion with the help of one of his most trusted allies.

Macpherson was finally seized in an operation executed by Lord Duff in the autumn of 1700 at the St Rufus Fair in Keith.

As battle broke out, one of Macpherson's men was killed with the target captured after a woman threw a piece of rug over him from an upstairs window.

He was tried in Banff by Sheriff Nicholas Dunbar, a friend of Lord Braco, and was condemned to hang for the crimes of purse cutting, theft - and of being an Egyptian or gypsy.

According to the Clan Macpherson Museum at Newtommore there are many legends surrounding the outlaw - with the "tales concerning his death even stranger."

Condemned "to be hanged by the neck betwixt the hours of two and three," Lord Braco, on hearing that a lone rider was approaching from Turriff with a reprieve, had the town clock turned forward by 15 minutes to ensure the execution went ahead.

Before his death, Macpherson apparently mounted the scaffold at Banff to play the tune he had composed in his cell.

When he was finished he offered the fiddle to the crowd which had gathered - but no one dared to accept.

He then smashed his instrument and dropped it at his feet, with the remnants on display at the museum.

The tune he is said to have composed is widely known as "Macpherson's Rant" or "Macpherson's Lament".

Robert Burns later used it as the basis "Macpherson's Farewell."

Those involved in moving the clock forward were punished, and for many years afterwards the clock was kept fifteen minutes fast, as a reminder of Macpherson's killing.

Some time after 1839, the faces of the clocktower were removed from Banff and rehoused in the newly built Dufftown tower.

On November 16, 1700, James Macpherson was hung from the clocktower at Banff with alleged foul play surrounding events that led him to the gallows.

His downfall was engineered by his sworn enemy, Lord Duff of Braco, who was incensed by the antics of the outlaw's band of lawless freebooters operating in Aberdeen, Banff and Moray.

Macpherson was captured but escaped on two occasions, once in Inverness and on another occasion in Aberdeen, but was finally seized in an operation executed by Lord Braco in the autumn of 1700 at the St Rufus Fair in Keith.

The skilled swordsman was tried in Banff by Sheriff Nicholas Dunbar, a friend of Lord Braco, and was condemned to hang for the crimes of purse cutting, theft – and of being an Egyptian or gypsy.

Macpherson was ordered to be "to be hanged by the neck betwixt the hours of two and three".

It's at this point that the story begins to stand out, though, for it's said that Lord Braco, on hearing that a lone rider was approaching from Turriff with a reprieve, had the town clock turned forward by 15 minutes to ensure the execution went ahead.

MacPherson didn't go quietly and varying accounts of his final minutes all suggest he performed a tune on his fiddle before smashing it to pieces when the crowd failed to take him up on his offer of playing it again at his wake.

Reminders of that now-legendary day can still be found in the town today, including the Broken Fiddle cafe on Strait Path and a painting paying tribute to him in Banff Museum.
