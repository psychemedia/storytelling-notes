ASTOUNDING SUPERSTITION. At Braxcka, in Bosnia, an superstition has come to life again which resembles the fables of Jewish ritual murders. In Bosnia the people have believed at all times that bridges could not be firm and lasting unless human being was walled in it. Thus there is legend connected with the handsome Roman bridge at Mostar which says that the fine arch across the Narenta. ocnld not finished until the architect walled up in it a bridal pair. Now that a solid bridge is being built across the Save at Brazeka, this superstition is revived. It is rumoured everywhere that the gipsies are stealing children to sell them to the contractors, who wall one in each pillar. A few days ago there was a regular pursuit of some unlucky gipsies, of whom it had been said that they were raiding for children.

 Monty Chichester personal blurb:

 Performance storyteller based on the Isle of Wight, Tony "Monty" Hirst is teller of tales from the time of once, a weaver of stories heard and found, and a shaper of stories from archives past. A repeat performer at Ventnor Fringe, regular teller at open mics, folk nights, beer festivals and one-man shows on "the Island" (as if there were no other island in the world...), Monty (as if a one-word name were all that is required...) has also started to develop something of a habit of popping up in tea tents and appearing around bonfires at various music festivals across the UK...

Synopsis:

A young girl and her brother are given a secret that brings a community together, before a King’s purchase from a traveling tinker ruins his banqueting table. A family heirloom and a kindly deed bring other stories to mind, set against a world where there was too much time..

One sentence:

Performance storytelling solo show of connected and nested, humorous and hope-filled, traditional tales

...

A fiddler is called a spelmann (plural: spelmenn) in Norwegian, literally “play(ing) man”, and though the tradition is exemplified by the hardanger fiddle, the tunes extend to other folk instruments as well, chiefly as dulcimers and jaw harps. Spelmenn did not live off their vocation. They were working men, farmers, carpenters, and loggers with rough, leathery hands. A fiddle tune is called a slått (plural: slåtter), from the verb slå meaning “to strike”. Slått can also mean “reaping”, which resembles the movement of a fiddler bowing his instrument, though the terminology goes back to Norse culture, and even precedes local adoption of bowed instruments.

...

The Devil's Ditty

One tune called Fanitullen, or “The Devil's Ditty”, has grown to such popularity that tired fiddlers will refer to it simply as “the tourist jig”. It comes with the following legend: A fight broke out, as is wont to do, at a wedding in Hol in Buskerud county in 1724. Given that fights were welcome occurrences, perhaps even better understood as spontaneous brawling tournaments, rather than fits of blind violence, the toastmaster went to the cellar to draw a prize of beer for the winner. When he came down, he spied a strange fellow sitting on the beer barrel, playing a tune he had never heard before. The technique was new to him as well: He played the fiddle upside down with the neck against his chest, and tapped the rhythm against the side of the barrel – not with a human heel, but a hoof, like a horse. The toastmaster, now realizing he was front row and center to an audience with the devil himself, turned and ran like a bat out of hell, only to find that one of the two brawlers lay dead in the courtyard. Both the fight and the death, by the way, is apparently true and attested by legal documents. Make what you will of the rest.

Hitar Petar and His Shadow
Another folk character starring in many tales is Hitar Petar (Witty Peter), famous for making jokes about people.

Once Hitar Petar went to the market without any money. He saw a soup vendor selling delicious soup. As he didn’t have money with him, Hitar Petar took a piece of bread out of his pocket and held it in the tasty smelling steam coming out of the soup pot. After a while, the bread was well flavored and Hitar Petar ate it. Seeing this, the vendor asked Hitar Petar to pay for the food.

“But I just held my bread over the steam, I won’t pay” said Hitar Petar.

“If you won’t pay, then you deserve to be beaten with a stick” said the vendor.

“No problem. But if I flavored the bread using your steam, then you should beat only my shadow” said Hitar Petar

Everyone at the market started laughing at the greedy vendor.
