Salisbury and Winchester Journal - Monday 28 February 1803

 Bartazzi, an Italian, who is already under imprisonment for vending pernicious publications, was Saturday tried two indictments in the Court King's Bench, on the prosecution the Society instituted for the suppression of Vice, for similar offences. It was the wish of the Society to obtain the sanction of this High Court their institution. Mr. Garrow, who conducted prosecution, most eloquently expatiated the enormous guilt this man whose trade it was to corrupt the principles of youth; compared the employing person to deal with him, and then giving evidence against him, to the practice of sending out Police Officers in the track of a known highwayman, that they might robbed and convict him. " When wicked men combine, good men must associate," was the motto which the Society had adopted from Mr. Burke; and he fully vindicated their right thereto.—The evidence against the Defendant was clear; Lord Ellenborough expressed his full approbation of the proceedings, and the Jury without hesitation pronounced him Guilty on both indictments* The wife of J. Aitkin was tried for a similar offence. A Gentleman, who is a Member of the Society, proved that' purchased most indecent print her for guinea; that the room to which she introduced him abounded with books and prints of the most shocking description, and she was bringing up a family in the midst of this infamy; yet the husband of this woman is now in confinement for misdemeanor of the same kind, and that on a second conviction. She pleaded that she was necessitated to get a living. Lord Ellenborough told her, she would bring inevitable ruin on herself by continuing in this co irse of life. The monster Vice appeared to rear its head in defiance, the more it was opposed on this ground; but he would exert all the energy of the Law against it, and warned her and her associates, that many sacrifices to infamy would not tire him the career of his duty. The Jury, without hesitation, pronounced her Guilty.

https://archive.org/details/encyclopedia-britannica-volume-8/page/55/mode/2up
Encyclopedia Britannica, Volume 8 1911

DEODAND (Lat. Deo dandum, that which is to be given to God), in English law, was a personal chattel (any animal or thing) which, on account of its having caused the death of a human being, was forfeited to the king for pious uses. Blackstone, while tracing in the custom an expiatory design, alludes to analogous Jewish and Greek laws, `[Compare also the rule of the Twelve Tables, by which an animal which had inflicted mischief might be surrendered in lieu of compensation.]` which required that what occasions a man's death should be destroyed. In such usages the notion of the punishment of an animal or thing, or of its being morally affected from having caused the death of a man, seems to be implied. The forfeiture of the offending instrument in no way depends on the guilt of the owner. This imputation of guilt to inanimate objects or to the lower animals is not inconsistent with what we know of the ideas of uncivilized races. In English law, deodands came to be regarded as mere forfeitures to the king, and:

the rules on which they depended were not easily explained by any key in the possession of the old commentators. The law distinguished, for instance, between a thing in motion and a thing standing still. If a horse or other animal in motion killed a person, whether infant or adult, or if a cart ran over him, it was forfeited asa deodand. On the other hand, if death were caused by falling from a cart or a horse at rest, the law made the chattel a deodand if the person killed were an adult, but not if he were below the years of discretion. Blackstone accounts for the greater severity against things in motion by saying that in such cases the owner is more usually at fault, an explanation which is doubtful in point of fact, and would certainly not account for other instances of the same tendency. Thus, where a man's death is caused by a thing not in motion, that part only which is the immediate cause is forfeited, as "if a man be climbing up the wheel of a cart, and is killed by falling from it, the wheel alone is a deodand"; whereas, if the cart were in motion, not only the wheel but all that moves along with it (as the cart and the loading) are forfeited. A similar distinction is to be found in Britton. Where aman is killed by a vessel at rest the cargo is not deodand; where the vessel is under sail, hull and cargo are both deodand. For the distinction between the death ofa child and the death of an adult Blackstone accounts by suggesting that the child "was presumed incapable of actual sin, and therefore needed no deodand to purchase propitiatory masses; but every adult who died in actual sin stood in need of such atonement, according to the humane superstition of the founders of the English law." Sir Matthew Hale's explanation was that the child could not take care of himself, whereon Blackstone asks why the owner should save his forfeiture on account of the imbecility of the child, which ought to have been an additional reason for caution. The finding of a jury was necessary to constitute a deodand, and the investigation of the value of the instrument by which death was caused occupied an important place among the provisions of early English criminal law. It became a necessary part of an indictment to state the nature and value of the weapon employed —as, that the stroke was given by a certain penknife, of the value of sixpence—so that the king might have his deodand. Accidents on the high seas did not cause forfeiture, being beyond the domain of the common Jaw; but it would appear that in the case of ships in fresh water the law held good. The king might grant his right to deodands to another. In later times these forfeitures became extremely unpopular; and juries, with the connivance of judges, found deodands of trifling value, so as to defeat the inequitable claim. At last, byan act of 1846 they were abolished, the date noticeably coinciding with the introduction of railways and modern steam-engines.

Monmouthshire Merlin
16th April 1831

RUMOURED ATROCITIES IN MANCHESTER. On Wednesday last, an extraordinary sensation was excited throughout the whole of this town, by the alleged discovery of a gang of monsters, who were supposed to rival Burke and Hare in the number and atrocity of their crimes. The origin of the popular alarm was this. About twenty minutes past twelve o'clock on Wednesday, a little girl, who was passing along Aughton- street, Oxford-road, happened to look in at the window of a house, and saw an old woman employed in cutting the flesh from a dead greyhound which was lying upon a table. The singularity of this circumstance induced the girl to mention the matter to several persons whom she met, and a crowd being soon collected the door was forced open and they rushed in. They found the old woman, whose name is Amelia Anderton, engaged as we have stated. On asking her what she was doing she did not speak, but when they offered to search further, she placed her back against the door of a pantry to oppose their entrance. Having forcibly removed her, they found an earthen jug full of water, in which was the skeleton of a child, almost the whole of the flesh having been removed from the bones. They also found in the other parts of the house a number of small bones, part of the finger of a child, and a singular-looking instrument, which the credulity of the people immediately led them to designate a blood sucker." On a quantity of shavings in a corner of the room, was found a female infant, apparently in a weak state of health, whose illness was of course attributed to the occasional application of the blood sucker" to its veins. The senseless mob then began to use some violence to the wretched old creature, whose life might probably have been sacrificed, had not the landlord of the house and some other persons protected her from the popular fury, and conveyed her to the police office along with the whole of the bones and instruments which had been dis- covered. The story having spread like wild-fire over the town, embellished with a thousand absurd exaggerations, the police office was crowded during the whole of the afternoon, by persons who gazed with mingled curiosity and horror upon the relics which had been seized. The parties were described as a gang of Burk- ites, who made a regular trade of killing children for the purpose of converting their flesh into veal pies Among other rumours, it was stated that the Knot Mill fair had been plentifully sup- plied with these delicacies. About half-past eight in the evening, a man named Gillies, son to the old woman in custody, made his appearance in Piccadilly, in a state of intoxication, and stated that he knew about all the murders of the children in Oxford- road, and that he was a resurrectionist and an articulator of human skeletons. The watchman on hearing these mysterious confessions conveyed him to the New Bailey. On Thursday, the New Bailey was besieged, long before the arrival of the magistrates, by hundreds of persons eager to wit- ness the examination of the prisoners. Their appearance at the bar, certainly did not tend to diminish the prejudice which was entertained against them. The old woman presented as miserable a specimen of age and decrepitude as can easily be imagined, and her appearance alone would in a former age have been ac- counted sufficient to support a charge of demonology or witchcraft. The male prisoner, a strong middle-aged man, had a counte- nance peculiarly repulsive and forbidding. The principal wit- ness examined was James Needham, the landlord of the house which the prisoners occupied, who was present at the capture of the old woman, and who gave a detailed but evidently exagge- rated account of the discoveries made on that occasion. He said that besides the skeleton of the child, he found a number of fingers, bones, &c. of other children that the child seemed to be quite fresh, and could only have been killed the day before, and that he was sure the brass instrument was a blood-sucker," &c. Gillies said in his own defence that he was a preparer of skeletons, and that the body of the child, which was only a foetus that had never come to its full time, had been given him, after being dissected by a professional gentleman in the town, to clean and articulate. With regard to the other fingers of children which were said to have been found in the house, there was only about half of one of the fingers of the child which had accidentally been cut off, and which would be found to have lost a part of its finger, on the body being examined. The other bones spoken g of were those of dogs and other animals, which he was in the habit of preparing for medical men and students of natural history. The living child was his own, and had always lived with them. The Magistrates said the probability was that the prisoner's account was true, and that the skeleton was a mere anatomical preparation. But he should require both prisoners to find bail, two sureties in X20 each, for their appearance that day fortnight; and in the mean time further inquiry should be made into the truth of the prisoner's story. Since the examination of the prisoners, the gentleman to whom Gillies referred as his employer has personally confirmed the truth of his statement. The body, which was that of a still-born infant, after being used in the dissecting-room, was entrusted to Gillies for anatomical preparation. He was told not to remove it from the lecture room, lest by its discovery any popular excitement, such as has been produced, might be occasioned. In spite of this caution, however, he persisted in taking it to his own house. He has been employed in preparing the skeletons of animals and other anatomical preparations, for a considerable time, by the same gentleman, who paid him regular wages of £1 per week. He is a remarkably expert articulator, but being very dissipated, his family remains in the state of extreme poverty which their dwelling exhibited. The brass instrument which the witnesses in the luxuriance of their fancy termed a blood-suck- er," is a syringe of peculiar construction, used in what are called blood preparations," and by which a mixture of liquid wax and other compounds is injected into the veins of a subject, so as to represent blood. These are used in the illustration of lectures on the blood vessels, &c. We believe there was some portion of a mixture of this sort found in a basin in the prisoner's house, which the rabble of course converted into the blood of the slaughtered innocents.

TO DO

THE WIZARD OF BALWEARIE.

Of the many eminent sons which the kingdom of ¥ifs can lay claim to, there are few, if any, who can be said to have a more unique or interesting history than Michael Scott. Born about the year 1214 he Bad his life cast in a time when ignorance was general, and learning confined to a very few, In Scotland in his day there was not a single college or University, and Michael had to go into foreign lands o acquire the knowledge he thirsted after. Having received all the education which could be had in his native land he set out on a visit to Oxford, and from there to France and Italy, In the popular mind Michael Scott is associated with "Gramarie," and all manner of extraordinary intercourse with the Supernatural, and his illustrious namesake, the Minstrel of Abbotsford has done much to make the *rude Superstitions with which his 'contemporaries *Wrounded his name palatable to our modern *Crticism of witchraft and the black art. We do not wish to lay even the least of our fingers on that Ye4sing and fanciful picture of the wizard, but only to state, with as much precision as the materials to our hand will afford, the actual course of his life, and instance one or two of the more interesting fabl;si romance credits him with having had a hand in. Having passed to Oxford Michael devoted himself with zeal to the study of philosophical pursuits Astronomy, or rather astrology, was one of his favourite studies, and here, as well as in France and Italy, he pursued it with great success. To his knowledge of it much of his reputation as a wizard may be attributed, and in his day a man who stayed up the nights gazing at the stars from a darkened room, and made long and complicated calculations on papers covered with strange figures and lines, must have appeared to the unlettered a madman or a magician. As Michael was a shrewd, long-headed, cautious man, in the ordinary aﬁ'airs of life, the latter character was bestowed on im. At Oxford he studied not only astrology and the sister science of geometry, but the languages, including Latin, Greek, Hebrew, and Arabic, as well as logic, rhetoric, theology, and chemistry. Chemistry included alchemy, which was then the favourite study of princes as well as scholars, and all were alike eager in the pursuit of it. The transmutation of the metals was the delusion of the time, and Edward I. of England was one of the most ardent believers in the possibility of the process. Lully, the great philosopher, was invited by him to England, and it was a common belief at the time " that the gold which was then expended in fitting out an expedition to the Holy Land had issued, not from the exchequer of the king, but from the laboratory of the sage." Having exhausted the curriculum of Oxford, Michael Scott repaired to the University of Paris, and his special study there was mathematics, and so eagerly did he devote himself to the science, and so great was his proficiency in it, that he came to be known by the academic surname of Michael the Mathematician. — Here too, he pursued his study of the sacred languages and of theology, and received the degree of doctor of the latter. But this was not enough, for he also started medicine, and became an adept of the healing art. Such an encyclopedia of learning in these dark times was a phenomenon, and when he prepared to go into Italy his fame preceded him. In Italy he first assumed the role of prophet, and was successful in very many of his predictions, and it is conclusive proof of his fame in that country that Dante gave him a prominent place in the "Inferno." From Italy the Magician proceeded to Spain, then for the most part under the rule of the Moors. In Spain the Scotch Wizard was in his element. That country was then the most enlightened in the world, for the Moors had carried with them from Arabia that knowledge of the occult sciences which made them famous in the days of Job, and had established at Toledo an University more famous then than any other in the world. Here he may be supposed to have perfected his knowledge of the Arabic tongue, for we find it was at Toledo he translated Aristotle's "History of Animals" from Arabic into Latin, Here too he was able to pursue, under peculiarly favourable circumstances, astrology and alchemy, and now that he was fairly established as a Magician and Prophet, to them he devoted great attention. We next find Michael Scott making a very important figure in the world. The Emperor Frederic I, was a great patron of learning, and bad his heart set on having the works of Aristotle translated (into Latin, of course, which was the universal tongue). The difficulty was to find a scholar competent for the task, and Fife and Scotland may well be proud the Wizard of Balwearie was selected. It is impossible to over-estimate the importance of the work imposed on Michael Scott, for although he was assisted by many other learned men the work was done under his supervision, and we may be sure his zeal and capacity for work would drive him to take the burden on his own back. His residence in Spain and his knowledge of the Arabic tongue now stood him in good stead. Aristotle was a Greek philosopher, and the knowledge of Greek in Michael Scott's day was very limited, He perhaps knew more of the language than any other living, but he was not sufficiently acquainted with it to translate from it, With the Arabic it was otherwise; he knew it perfectly; and as the Moors in their universities at Bagdad and Cordova had the works of the great Stagyrte philosopher translated into their native tongue, Michael Scott was well qualified to convey it therefrom into the language of the learned in Western Europe. On this great work the Wizard was engaged for many years, and carried it to a successful completion. Besides his translation of Aristotle he has the credit of being the author of many other works, one on physiognomy in particular. Tt is, however, a work of very little philosophical merit, but must have been exceedingly popular, as it ran through thirteen editions. Physiognomy, Michael assures us, "is the doctrine of safety, the election of good, the avoidance of evil. Tt is the comprehension of virtue, the detestation and pretermission of vice. The knowledge of this science is induced and created by the true love of God and the fear of the devil, by the principle of faith and the hope of the imperishable reward of eternal life." Another fantastic work attributed to the Magician is one entitled "The Philosopher's Banquet, furnished with a few dishes for health, but large discourse for pleasure." The subjects discussed in this work, says a learned writer, "are ludicrously heterogeneous both in their nature and juxtaposition; the work treats of ram's flesh in one chapter and of the bishop of the Gentiles in another; of pot herbs and wicked women. It investigates the actions of kings and emperors, and explains the causes why some eggs crack on the fire and others do not. It treats of the nature and dignity of friendship, and endeavours to determine whether fishes chew their meat or not. Last of all, it contains certain "honest and merry jests to exhilarate our bodies and minds at our tables, which are to be served in as carawayes at the end of our feast." The work is a strange mixture of the absurd and puerile, with much that is shrewd, learned, and gensible. After leaving the court of the Emperor Frederic the Wizard would seem to have adopted medicine as a profession, and to have made himself as famous for his skill in it as he was for his scholarship. "The leprosy, the gout, the dropsy, and other dreadful diseases generally thought incurable," says a writer, "were with little trouble and in the most wonderful manner removed by his art." Thus engaged in translating Aristotle, studying the heavens, and practising the healing art, Michael Scott passed many years in Germany. When he did prepare to return to his native land he was an old man, and bad a reputation for exceeding wisdom and knowledge. And compared with the prevailing ignorance his reputation was deserved, but we do not find that contemporary chroniclers credited him with that alliance with the unseen powers which later writers attribute to him. We find that after his return to Scotland he, along with Sir David Wemyss, were the two Scottish ambassadors sent to bring from Norway, on the death of Alexander III., the young Queen Margaret, his grand-daughter. As is well known, the heiress of the Scottish throne sickened on the voyage, and died in Orkney, and her death led to the Bruce and Baliol contentions for the crown, and ultimately to the English oppression. The last mention made of the Wizard in Scottish history is in "connection with the embassy to Norway, and it is ~supposed he died shortly after his return. His life was on the whole a studious and uneventful one, and especially so in a time when lettered ease or seclusion was next to impossible. Michael's great reputation as a magician and prophet no doubt ensured him from the interference or annoyance of the powerful barons, whether travelling abroad or residing at home, for, as has been well said, he was protected by the superstitious dread with which the vulgar regarded him, for he was universally reputed a magician; and many a fierce baron who would have cared little to rob the defenceless son of science may have trembled beneath his steel coat when the Wizard declared his far-famed pame, and threatened to make him feel its power. It is pleasing thus to see superstition, which in later ages has been the bane of knowledge, becoming in those earlier and darker periods the protectress of infant science." We may now notice a few of the fables associated with Michael Scott, and the first is one referred to by an Italian writer., It is said the Wizard, having cast his own horoscope, and found his death was to be occasioned by a stone falling upon his bare skull, endeavoured to prevent the demon of fate from accomplishing his end after that method, and Michael invented a magic casque or steel cuirass, which he wore under his cap. Fate, however, was not to be avoided, for the Wizard, passing a cathedral as the vesper bells were ringing, he entered to pay his devotions. As he knelt upon the stone floor of the cathedral Michael reverentially removed his cap, and with it the cerrilerium or casque which was fixed inside of it. That was the moment of the Magician's fate, for the belfrey rope having loosened a stone just above where he knelt, it gave way as he prayed, and at one and the same time deprived him of his life and proved his one fallibility as a seer.

These were sung, or rather saId, in a monotone, by the professional Drolls, who doubtless added such things as they fancied would increase the interest of the story to the listeners. Niepeldally were they fond of introducing known characters on the scene, and and of mixing up events which had occurred within the tot; memory of the old people with the more ancient legend. The t. to following story, or rather parts of It, formed the subject proof one of the Cornish Christmas plays. When, I was a ough boy, I well remember being much delighted with the es of coarse acting of a set of Christmas players, woo exhibited hill in the great hall " of a farmhouse at which I was visiting, sea- and who gave us the principal incidents of Duffy and nrecal the Devil Terrytop; one of the company doing the part in to of Choru3, and filling up by rude descriptions-often In rhyme crat- -the parts which the players could not represent. He It was in cider-making atne. Squire Lovel of Trove, or has more correctly, Trewouf, rode up to Burian Church-town to table procure help, boys and maidens were in request, some to gather treat the apples from the trees, others to carry them to the cider- two mill. Passing along the village as hastily as the dignity of a and squire would allow him, his attention was drawn to a great irom noise-scolding In a shrill treble voice, and crying-proceeding ndly from Janey tihygwin'a door. 'i'h squire rodc up to the cottage, 3ton, and he Haw the old woman beating her step-daughter Duffy villo about the head with the skirt of her swing tail gown, in which nor- she had teen carrying out the ashes. She made such a dust enec that the squire was nearly choked asd almost blinded with the int's wood ashes. heir '" What cheer, Janey?" cries the squire; " what's the to-do and with you and Duify?" Meine "Oh, the lazy huzzy!" shouts Janey, "is all her time cour- don, scying and courranming with the boys! she will never stay in ton, to boll the porridge, kuitthe stockings, or spin the yarn." ec., 'Don't believe her, your honour," exclaims Duffy; "my nah knitting and spinning is the best in the parish", as the war of tongues continued in this strain for some time, sae- the old squire looking calmly on, and resolving in his mind to ibly take Duffy home with him to 'lrove, her appearance evidently cate pleasing him greatly. Squire Loyal left the old and young ton, woman to do the best they could, and went round the village th's to complete his hiring. When he returned peace had been lcy, declared between them; but when Lovel expressed his desire I to to take Duffy home to his house to help the housekeeper to do tate the spinning, "A pretty spinner she is" shouted old Janey at Ills, the . op of her voice. "Try me, your honour," said Duffy, 8 of Iurteying very low; "my yarns are the best In the pariah." and ' We'll soon try that," said the squire; " Jeny will be glad er; to get qults oi thee, 1eee and thou'lt ho nothing loth to leave in- ber- so 3ump up behInd mle, Daffy." ary No sooner said than done, The maid Duffy, without ecre. hat mocy, mounted behind the squire on the horse, and they logged Ibly silently down to Trove. Squire Level's old housekeeper was almost blind-one eye had been put out by an angry old wizard, I WeB. inti through sympathy she was rapidly losing thc power of the s"eMng with the other. This old dame was consequently very erit glad of some one to help her In spinning and knitting, The ach Introduction over, the housekeeper takes Duffy up into the ulk earret where the wool was kept, and where the spinning was i as done in the summer, and requests her to commence her work. t icr, 'u he truth must be told Duffy was an idle slit, she codli cat neither knit nor spin. Well, here she was left alone, and, of course, expected to produce a good specimen of her work The I act, garret was piled from the floor to the key-beams with fleeces I , to of wool. Duffy looked despairingly at them, and then sat herself down on the "turt"-the spinning-wheel-and cried out, "Curse the spinning and knitting. The devil may spin and knit for the squire for what I rare." And scarcely had Duffy spoken these words than she heard ai r rustling noise behind some woolpacks, and forth walked a dof queer-looking little man, with a remarkable pair of eyes, which nd seemed to send out flashes of light. There was something Red uncommonly knowing In the twist of his mouth, and his curved he nose had an air of curious intelligence. He was dressed in it' black, and moved towards Duffy with a jaunty air, knocking c ei- something against the floor at every step he took, L "Duffy'dear," said this little gentleman, "I'll do all the a e spinning and knitting for thee." b5 "Thank's," says Duffy, quite astonished, t by "Duffy, dear, a lady shall you be." "Thank's, your honour," smiled Duffy. "But, Duffy dear, remember," coaxingly said the queer little man-"remember that for all this, at the end of three years you must go with me unless you can find out my name." Duffy was not the least bit frightened, nor did she hesitate long, but presently struck a bargain with her kind but unknown friend, who told her she had only to wish, and her every wish should be fulfilled; and as for the spinning and knitting, she would dnd all she required under the blact ram's fleece. He then departed. How, Duffy could not tell, but in a moment the queer little gentleman was gone. Duffy sung in Idleness, I and slept until it was time for tier to make her appearance. So she wished for some yarns, and looking under the black fleece she found them. Those were shown by the housekeeper to the squire, and they both declared "they had never seen such beautiful yarns." The next day Duffy was to knit this yarn into stockings. Duffy idled, as only professed idlers can be i dle; but in due time, she had been excessively industrious, she produced a pair of stockings for the old squire. If the yarn was beautiful, the stockings were beyond all praise. They were as fine as silk, and as strong as leather. Squire Lovel soon gave them a trial; and when he came home that night after hunting, he declared he would never wear any other than Duffy's stockings. He had wandered all day through brake and briar, furze and brambles, there was not a scratch on his legs, and lh was as dry as a bone. There was no end to hls praise of Duffy's stockings, ten Duffy had a rare time of it now-she could do what she pleased, and rove where she willed. She was dancing on tle Pr; small-bed half the day, with all the gossiping women who brought their grist to bo ground. la thioso ' good old times" It is the ladies of the parish would take their corn to mllaod serge pos . tho lur themselves, When a few of them met together, they would either tell stories, or dance whilst the corn was grinding. Sometimes the dance would be on the mill-bed, sometimes out side on the green. On scme occasions the miller's fiddle would be wit in request, at others the "arowd "((a sievoeovered with sheep. tha, eskial WveB made to do the duty a of tambourine. So Duffy was at if always finding excuses to go to mill. and many "a round' was would she dance with the best people in the parish. Old Bet, the miller's wife, was a witch, and heb found out evie who did Duffy's work for her. Duffy and old Bet were always the best of friends, and she never told any one about Duffy's knitting friend, nor did she ever say a word about the stockings being unfinished. There was always a stilte doenlc. timi On Sundays the people went to Barlan Church, from all parts, to look at the squire's stockings; and ho olli squire fo rg would stop at the Cross, proud enough to show them. llt could feet hunt out; il Through brambles clitl hi rCe il all arts of weather arci Ilfs ol shaliiks were at soind oc i fboend illt ini leutiier." bert Duffy was now sought after by all the young totcli of the lihg country; and at last the squire, fearing to lose a pretty girl, trun and one who was aio useful to him, married her himself, and pow she became.,according to the fashion of rite time and place, fnos Lady Level; but she wai commonly known by her neighbours as the Duffy Lady. the Lady Lovel kept the devil hard at work. Stockingte, all like sorts of lie uqderclothbig, Pedding, and mhulgh orsnagutal p1 |work, tbe like Gi which was t neVer acen. was produced at eom- muand, and plaaStd oi ansher own. Duffy pased nlev tmerytm of it, but somehow or other she was never happy when she was eomopeled to play the lady . She p Rs~ed m ueh moere of her tiie with the old crone at tho mill than In the drawing--rooms at Trove. The squire sported aud ank and ard c little about Duffy, so long as she provided with knitted garments, The three years were nearly at an end. Duffy had tried every plan to find out tbe devil's name, but had failed in all. She began to fear that she should have to go with her queer friend, and Duffy became melancholy. Old Bet endeavoured to rouse her, persuading her that she could, from her long experience, and many dealings with the imps of darkness, at the last moment put her in the way of escaping her doom. Duffy went day after day to her garret, and there each day was the devil gibing and zeerieg till she was almost mad. There was but another day. Bet was seriously consulted now, and as good as her word, she promised to use her power. Duffy Lady was to bring down to the mill that very c'enhlg a Jack of the strongest beer she had in the cellar. She was not to go to bed until the Squire returned from hunting, no matter how late, and she waged to make no remark in reply to anything the squire might tell her. The Jack of beer was duly carried to the mill, acd Duffy returned home very melancholy to wait for the squire. No sooner had Lady Loy left the mill than old Bet came out with the "c erowd or her shoulders, and the blackjack in her hand, She shut the door, and turned the water off the mill-w bel,-threw her red cloak about her, and away. She was seen by her neighbours going, towards Belelt. A man saw the old woman trudging past the Pipers, and through the Dawnse Main into the downs, but there he lost sight of her, and no one could tell where old Bet was gone to at that time of night. Duffy waited long and anxiously. By and by the dogs came brine alone. They were covered with ??, their tongues were hanging out of their mouths, and all the servants said they must have mt he avi's ouds ithutheads. Duffy was seriously alarmed. Midnight came but no squire. At last he arrived, but like a crazy, eranek-brained man, he kept singing, "Itereasto Ihoe devil, With his wooden pick and shovel." He was neither drunk nor frightened, but wild with some strange excitement. After a long time Squire Lovel sat down, and began, "My dear Duffy. you haven't smiled this long time; but now I'll tell 'e something that would make ye laugh if you're dying. If you'd seen what I've seen to-night, ha, ha, ha I licere' to the devil, . 'ith hie wooden pick and shovel." True to her orders, Duffy said not a word, but allowed the Equire to ramble on as he plerted, At length he told her the following story of his adventures, with interruptions which have not bean retained, and with numerous coarse expressions which are best forgotten:- "Duffy, dear, I left home at break of day this morning. I hunted all the moors from Trove to Trevider, and never started a hare all the live-long day. I determined to hunt all right but that I'd have a brace to bring home, So, at nightfall I went down Lemorna Bottom3, then up Brene Downsee, and as we passed the Daw SeC Main up started a hare, as fine a hare as ever was seen. She passed the Pipers, down through the ateens, in the Month of the dogs halt the, time, yet they couldn't catch her at all, As fine a chase as ever was seen, until she took into the Fugoe Hole.* In went the dogs after her, and I followed, the owls and bats fairground my head. On we went, through water and mud, a mile or more, I'm quite certain. I didn't know the place was so loig before. 'At last w came to a broad pool of water, when the dogs lost the scent, and ran back past me howling and jowling. terrified almost to death. A little further on I turned round a corner, and saw a glimmering fire on the other side of the water, and there were St. Leven witches in scores. Some were riding. on ragwort, some on brooms some were floating on their three-legged stools, and some, who had been milking the little good cowain Wales, bad some back astride of the largest lceks the could find, Amongst the rest there was our Bet of the lill, with her 'crowd' in ber hand, and my own blackjack slung across her shoulders. In a short time the witches gathered round the fire, and blowed it up, after a strange fashion, till it burned up into a brilliant blue flame. Then I saw amongst the rest a queer little man In black, with a long forked tail, which be held high in the air and twirled around. Bet struck her crowd as soon as he appeared, nod beat up the tune, 3lerce to the devil, With hiH wooden pick and shovel, N Pging tis by ile busel, WitT hifi tal ock'd up I' Then the queer little devil and all danced like the wind, and went faster aed faster, making such a Clatter, as if they had on each toot a pewter platter.' Every time the man in black came round by old Bet, he took a good pull from my own blackjack, till at first, as if he had been drinking my best beer, he seemed to have lost his head, when he jumped up and down, turned round and round, and roaring with laughter, sung, Duffy, my lady, you'll never Im now-what? -. That my name is Terrytop, Terrytop-.top1' When the squire sung those lines, he stopped suddenly, thinking that Duffy was going to die. She turned pale and red, and pale again. However, Duffy erdd nothing, and the squire proceeded;-' After the dance, all the witches made a ring around the fire, and again blew it up, until the blue flames reached the top of the 'Zawn.'t Then the devil danced through and through the fire, and springing ever and anon amongst the witches, kicked them soundly. At last-I was shaking with laughter at the tun-r shouted, 'Go it, Old Nick qind, lo, the lights went out, And I had to fly with all my speed, for everyone of the witches wore after me, I scampered )onmc somehow, and here I am. Why don't you laugh, Duffy?" Duffy did laugh, and laugh right heartily now, and when tired of their Ifo, the squire and the lady went to bed, The three years were up within an hour, Duffy had willed for an abundant supply of knitted things, and filled every chest In the house, She was in the best chamber trying to eram come more stockings Into a big chest, when the queer little man in black appeared before her, r Vell, Duffy, my dear," said hc, f have been to my word, and served you truly for three years as we agreed, so now I hope you will go with me, and make no objection." He bowed very obsequiously, almost to the ground, and regarded Duffy Lady with a very offensive leer. "1 fear," smiled Duffy, "that your country is rather warm, and might spolt my fair complexion." ,,It is not so hot as some people say, Duffy," was his reply; "but come along, I've kept my word, and of course a lady of your standing will kelp your word also. Can you tell me my name " Duffy curtsied, and smilingly said, "You have behaved like a true gentleman, yet I wouldn't like to go so far." The devil frowned, and approached as it Ieo would lay forcible hands upon her, "Maybe Your name is Lucifer?" He stamped his feet and grinned horridly. "Lucifer I Lucifer is no other than a servant to me in my own country." Suddenly calming again, he said quietly, "Lucifer! I would scarcely be seen speaking to him at court. But come along. When I spin for ladies I expect honourable treatment at their hands. You've two guesses more. But they are of little use; my name is not generally known on earth." "Perhaps," smiled Duffy again, my lord's name Is Bce- zebub 2"t iow he grinned, And his sides shook with convulsive joy. Bectzoba b! says he; "why, be little better than the other, a common devil, he. I believe he's some sort of a cousin -a Cornish cousin, you know." "I hope your honour," curtsied Duffy, will not take offence. Imputc my mistake to ignorance," Our Demon was rampant with joy; he danced around Duffy with delight, and was, seeing that she hesitated, about to seize her somewhat roughly. "Stop! stop! ahouta Duffy; "perhaps yon will be honest enough to admit that your name is Terrytop?" The gentleman in black locked at Duffy, and she steadily looked him In the lace. "Terrytop! deny It If you dare," says she. "A gentleman never denies his name," replied Terrytop, drawing himself up with much dignity. "I did not expect to he beaten by a young minx like you, Duffy but the pleasure of your company is merely postponed." Wth this Terrytop departed in fire and smoke, and all the devil's knitting suddenly turned to ashes. Squire Level was out hunting. away far on the moors, the d ay w.as cold and the winds piercing. Suddenly tbe stockings dropped from his legs and the homespun from his back, so that ike come home with nothing on but his shirt and his shoes, almost dead with cold. All this was attributed by the squire to the inficenee of old Bet, who, he thought, had punished him for pursuing her with his dogs when she had assumed the form of a hare. The story, as told by the Drollp. now rambles on. Duffy cannot furnish stockings. The squire is very wroth. There are many quarrels-mutual recriminations. Duffy's old sweet-heart is called in to beat the squire, and eventually peace is procured, by a stratagem of old Bets, which would rather shock the sense of Prolirfetv In the' nror navo, *'Ihere is at tradition tirovlb believed ein this locer side of Bfirlnii, that Ficgoe Ifoie cteedon froiL the clifs under ground So fur tilat lie ccl( of it is aalter the parlour cf the Tremewaeng's house in Trace, whicb is the ilnly reiccin Ing parrion of tbe cild situoloic *if the levels.

TO DO

MICHAEL SCOT, THE THOUGHT-READER OF THE TWELFTH CENTURY.

Michael Scot was one of the most learned men of the twelfth century. There is little doubt now that he was a native of Scotland, though it has been asserted that he was either an Englishman or an Teishman., The Lowland Scots were emigrants from the North of Ireland, and the name of "Scott" was used to distinguish them. But the coming over must have been long before Michael's days, for when he was offered ccclesiastical preferment in Ireland he declined it, as he said he kuew not the tengue of the people. England claims him because he was born in the verritory of Durham. But, as the See of Durham extended over the Scottish Border, Michael Scot might well be in it without being an Englishman. Michae! Scot came from the upper streams of the Tweed. There is an entry of money paid to the Crown in 1265 by one Michael Scot, and, though Michael the (irecat was in his grave by then, it shows | that the family name was still in the "waste lands of Strath, near Peebles." Alichael Scot—the Great—as I call him, studied at Durham and afterwards at Oxford. He next went to Pacis, and then to Bologna. But his life at the Court of Frederick II., King of Sicily, wlo was afterwards Emperor of Germany, is considered the years when he was most famous as a man of learning. Several of Michael Scot's first books are dedicated to King Frederick. Tradition says he was the King's tutor, and when there got the title of "Master Michael Scot." The situation of tutor gave Michael Scot many advantages. His home was then at Palermo. Thither went wise men of many nations. Michael Scot entered en study and learning, acquired the language of the Moors and the Greeks. Rare manuscripts abonunded in these languages. Michael pursued his favourite science of mathematics, and became so learned that he was known as "Michael the Mathematician." He also studied astronomy and its kindred scienceastrology. One of his books says :— «¢ Here endeth the Book of Michael Scot, astrologer to the Lord Frederick, Emperor of Rome, and ever august, which book he composed in simple style at the desive of the aforesaid Emperor." He says the book is intended for "young scholars who desire to learn the art of astronomy." At that time astronomy and astrology were almost one, so closely were they combined. ' The King, his pupil, married at fourtecen a Princess ten years his senior; but he was a clever student as well as a King, and Michael seems to have spent a good many useful years there. Afterwards he sailed to Spain, which at that time wasin high favour with students. At Toledo was a regular school of translation. It was the seat of medieval science and letters, Valuable books in the Arabic on medicine and mathematics were there. A study of Avistotle, of animals, of magic, of medicine, of chemistry, and of research into the cause that govern the mind and the body, was there entered into by students from all nations. To say a man had studied at To'edo was to mean that he had studied the « Plack art." That the Moors of Spain had studied mesmerism seems without a doubt. That they were clever thought-readers is proved. They studied "character" as cleverly as a gipsy does, and not only the lines of the hand, but the make and design of every part of the body. Herbs, stones, sounds, the stars, the cries of animals, all came into Arabian magic. The mysterious, the oceult were searched into. The Church forbade the study of magic, but it was known that at Toledo and other places ** wise men from the Kast" taughv the art of magic and pecromancy. Michael Seot, who studied all things, doubitless learned all there was to know of these arts, and also of alchemy, 'a science that was to make rich whoever found out the secret of making gold. Michael Scot returned to the Court of Frederick and then came back to Scotland. He found that the Churech looked with little favour on his great learning. He had visited all the great luropean schools, had writlen many books, and his fame as a learned man was known in all Christian countries. DBut the Church had whispered he was a heretic, and the common people said he studied magic. The Kmperor alse shared this abuse, and even worse. Nothing was teo bad to be said about the King. DBoth he and Michael Necot studied ancient Arabic manusoripts, i e eMRSt SO S by e canny." For were not the ¢ Moors and all their works accursed ¥' e R e e Michael, studying algebra and looking at the | stars, was going deeper and deeper into the mystery, but the unlearned called his studiesdiabolical teaching. But learned as Michael Scot was, it is his supposed | supernatural power that is best remembered by tradition. It is said-of him that when at Bologna he invited his friends to dinner, He did not prepare for it. When the guests were seated at dinner suddenly they found the table covered with the choicest food. Perhaps one dish came from the Royal kitchen in England, another from the French Royal kitchen, and others from Royal kitchens elsewhere. It is said that he had some nice things from the kitchen of the King of Sicily. At one-dinner the guests asked him for a "marvel." It was mid-winter, yet suddenly there appeared vines with fresh shoots and grapes before them. The guests were told to take a bunch | when Mictiael Scot should give the sign. At the word "cut," the guests each found themselves with a knife in ohe hand and his neighbour's sleeve in the other. The grapes were gone. It is said indeed that Michael Scot's feasts were only a cheat. The guests fed on nothing—it was all a fancy. Mesmerism we micht call it now. " One time Michael took Ulfo, a German Baron, out of the hall where the Erperor Frederick was washing his hands in perfumied water and drying them on embroidered towels. He was about to sit down to dinner, and his pages were round him with the golden ewers and basins. Michael Scot 'and Ulfo passed out. As it seemed to Ulfo they went away on an expedition, leaving Sicily in two great galleys, with many armed men, They came to a strange people, went through battles, and years passed away. Ulfo killed a hostile King, married his beautiful daughter, and became King. Twenty years passed—he returned to see the Bmpervor Trederick. Lo!—there was the Emperor still washing his hands in the golden basin full of perfumed water, It was all a dream. It is said that Ulfo remained ever after sad because of the Princess of his dreamn. This was magic in those days, but iy is mesmerism now. But the strangest things took place after Michael Scot returned to his native land. He had a familiar spirit, and it took him some hard thinking how to keep the familiav spirit employed. He told him to divide Eildon Hill inte three. It was done in a single night. One of the peaks was a little larger than the other, so the spirit took a spadeful from the big peak ' and put it on the smaller one. You may see it yourgelf if vou look to the sky-line of the hill. Wi\'e\% ii-i-él—ii-fi\lfibiiael Scot set the servant to curb the River Tweed with stone. There is a basaltic dyke which crosses the stream at AE_d.nam. On the third night Scot set his spirit to spin ropes of sand at the river mouth. These ropes of sand are being spun yet. They are the shifting sands of Berwick bar. One tale tells how a witch-wife got hold of Michael Scot's staff one day and turned him into a hare. He was coursed by his own hounds, and took refuge in a drain. Here he undid the spell, and resumed his own form, fully resolved to have his revenge. He sent his servant to beg of the woman bread for the hounds, and, when refused, he made him put a seroll on the door—* Maister Michael Scot's man socht breid and gat nane." As the servant did this the witch-wife was beiling porridge for the shearers. Suddenly the poor body ran round and round the fire which was in the centre of the floor. She was screaming the words of the spell when each of the harvesters came in, They, too, jeined the dance, as if they were possessed. The guidman came last, and, hearing the uprear, peeped in at the window. It was now terrible. The guidwife was almost dead, and yet round and round she span with the shearers after - Ler. 3 ' The guidman saw Scot with his men and dogs not far off, He went and begged him to release his wife, as he was sure he had the power. Michael Scot told him to walk backward through the door and lift off the spell as he weat. None after that dared touch Michael Scot's staff, b 5 ; These are but a fesw out of many things—wonderful things—Michael Scot said and did after his retarn from foreign lands, The truth seems to be that Michael Scot was learned in things then called the "black art," but now given the mewer names of hypnotism, magnetism, thought reading. All belonging to such sciences were supposed to be possessed. Perhaps he rather liked to shoew his powers, and mystify the dwellers by the Tweed. The old Moors—like the natives of Tedia—had queer old-world traditions and kuowledge. There has prown round Michael Scot's name wmany queer stories, He was a ' man -learned and gifted, He had a "slight, ??

ASTOUNDING SUPERSTITION. At Braxcka, in Bosnia, an superstition has come to life again which resembles the fables of Jewish ritual murders. In Bosnia the people have believed at all times that bridges could not be firm and lasting unless human being was walled in it. Thus there is legend connected with the handsome Roman bridge at Mostar which says that the fine arch across the Narenta. ocnld not finished until the architect walled up in it a bridal pair. Now that a solid bridge is being built across the Save at Brazeka, this superstition is revived. It is rumoured everywhere that the gipsies are stealing children to sell them to the contractors, who wall one in each pillar. A few days ago there was a regular pursuit of some unlucky gipsies, of whom it had been said that they were raiding for children.

...

A fiddler is called a spelmann (plural: spelmenn) in Norwegian, literally "play(ing) man", and though the tradition is exemplified by the hardanger fiddle, the tunes extend to other folk instruments as well, chiefly as dulcimers and jaw harps. Spelmenn did not live off their vocation. They were working men, farmers, carpenters, and loggers with rough, leathery hands. A fiddle tune is called a slått (plural: slåtter), from the verb slå meaning "to strike". Slått can also mean "reaping", which resembles the movement of a fiddler bowing his instrument, though the terminology goes back to Norse culture, and even precedes local adoption of bowed instruments.

The Devil's Ditty

One tune called Fanitullen, or "The Devil's Ditty", has grown to such popularity that tired fiddlers will refer to it simply as "the tourist jig". It comes with the following legend: A fight broke out, as is wont to do, at a wedding in Hol in Buskerud county in 1724. Given that fights were welcome occurrences, perhaps even better understood as spontaneous brawling tournaments, rather than fits of blind violence, the toastmaster went to the cellar to draw a prize of beer for the winner. When he came down, he spied a strange fellow sitting on the beer barrel, playing a tune he had never heard before. The technique was new to him as well: He played the fiddle upside down with the neck against his chest, and tapped the rhythm against the side of the barrel – not with a human heel, but a hoof, like a horse. The toastmaster, now realizing he was front row and center to an audience with the devil himself, turned and ran like a bat out of hell, only to find that one of the two brawlers lay dead in the courtyard. Both the fight and the death, by the way, is apparently true and attested by legal documents. Make what you will of the rest.

Hitar Petar and His Shadow
Another folk character starring in many tales is Hitar Petar (Witty Peter), famous for making jokes about people.

Once Hitar Petar went to the market without any money. He saw a soup vendor selling delicious soup. As he didn't have money with him, Hitar Petar took a piece of bread out of his pocket and held it in the tasty smelling steam coming out of the soup pot. After a while, the bread was well flavored and Hitar Petar ate it. Seeing this, the vendor asked Hitar Petar to pay for the food.

"But I just held my bread over the steam, I won't pay" said Hitar Petar.

"If you won't pay, then you deserve to be beaten with a stick" said the vendor.

"No problem. But if I flavored the bread using your steam, then you should beat only my shadow" said Hitar Petar

Everyone at the market started laughing at the greedy vendor.
