# Love More Than Salt

An old tale, with a set-up that may be familiar to some from a scene in Shakespeare's *King Lear*, which I first came in across in a collection of Duncan Williamson tales (), under the title **. A slightly different form, but still in the Scottish Tradition, was collected from Stanley Robertson (Tobar An Dualchais track 65002, 1979: *A princess is banished after telling the king she loves him...*). Similar variants of tale can also be found in mid-19th century Austrian and German collections.

The set-up can and reveal also be used to wrap a Cinderella or Donkeyskin style story, as for example in Cap o' Rushes in Jacobs' *English Fairy Tales* (source: Mr E. Clodd, from *Suffolk Notes and Queries, no. xxiii*, of the *Ipswich Journal*, Tuesday, August 7th, 1877, [p1](https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000071/18770807/016/0001), under the caption *62. The Suffolk King Lear*, and re-published by Mr. Lang in *Longman's Magazine*, vol. xiii, iss. 76, February, 1899, and also in *Folk-Lore*, Sept. 1890).

Folklore bores many just persons so terribly that one must apologise for the following legend. English märchen, or *contes populaires*, or nursery tales, are extremely rare, or, at least, they are very seldom found and published by collectors. The English ballads, as compared with the Scotch, are notably poor and trivial, whatever reason we may invent or discover; and of English tales we know few, save Jack the Giant Killer, Jack and the Bean Stalk, Tom Hickathrift, and Tom Thumb. But Mr. Clodd has discovered, in an odd corner of 'Suffolk Notes and Queries' in the Ipswich Journal, the following very remarkable and curious English märchen. It is well worth reading by anyone who likes a story; above all, by anyone who cares to study national character in traditional tales and the wanderings of tradition.

CAP O' RUSHES.

(TOLD BY AN OLD SERVANT TO THE WRITER WHEN A CHILD.)

Well, there was once a very rich gentleman, and he'd three daughters, and he thought to see how fond they was of him. So he says to the first, 'How much do you love me, my dear?'

'Why,' says she, 'as I love my life.'

'That's good,' says he.

So he says to the second, 'How much do you love me, my dear?'

'Why,' says she, 'better nor all the world.'

'That's good,' says he.

So he says to the third, 'How much do you love me, my dear?'

'Why, I love you as fresh meat loves salt,' says she.

Well, he were that angry. 'You don't love me at all,' says he, 'and in my house you stay no more.' So he drove her out there and then, and shut the door in her face.

Well, she went away on and on till she came to a fen, and there she gathered a lot of rushes and made them into a cloak, kind o', with a hood, to cover her from head to foot, and to hide her fine clothes. And then she went on and on till she came to a great house.

'Do you want a maid?' says she.

'No, we'don't,' says they.

'I haint nowhere to go,' says she, 'and I'd ask no wages, and do any sort o' work," says she. Pets taslie)

'Well,' says they, 'if you like to wash the pots and scrape the saucepans you may stay,' says they.

So she stayed there and washed the pots and scraped the saucepans and did all the dirty work. And because she gave no name they called her 'Cap o' Rushes.'

Well, one day there was to be a great dance a little way off, and the servants was let to go and look at the grand people. Cap o' Rushes said she was too tired to go, so she stayed at home.

'But when they was gone she offed with her cap o' rushes, and cleaned herself, and went to the dance. And no one there was so finely dressed as her.

Well, who should be there but her master's son, and what should he do but fall in love with her the minute he set eyes on her. He wouldn't dance with anyone else.

But before the dance were done Cap o' Rushes she slipped off, and away she went home. And when the other maids was back she was framin' to be asleep with her cap o' rushes on.

Well, next morning they says to her, 'You did miss a sight, Cap o' Rushes!'

'What was that?' says she.

'Why, the beautifullest lady you ever see, dressed right gay and ga'. The young master, he never took his eyes off of her.'

'Well, I should ha' liked to have seen her, says Cap 0' Rushes.

'Well, there's to be another dance this evening, and perhaps she'll be there.'

But, come the evening, Cap o' Rushes said she was too tired to go with them. Howsumdever, when they was gone, she offed with her cap o' rushes and cleaned herself, and away she went to the dance.

The master's son had been reckoning on seeing her, and he danced with no one else, and never took his eyes off of her. But, before the dance was over, she slipped off, and home she went, and when the maids came back she framed to be asleep with her cap o' rushes on.

Next day they says to her again, 'Well, Cap o' Rushes, you should ha' been there to see the lady. There she was again, gay and ga', and the young master he never took his eyes off of her.'

Well, there,' says she, 'I should ha' liked to ha' seen her.'

'Well, says they, 'there's a dance again this evening, and you must go with us, for she's sure to be there'

Well, come the evening, Cap o' Rushes said she was too tired to go, and do what they would she stayed at home. But when they was gone she offed with her cap o' rushes and cleaned herself, and away she went to the dance.

The master's son was rarely glad when he saw her. He danced with none but her and never took his eyes off her. When she wouldn't tell him her name, nor where she came from, he gave her aring and told her if he didn't see her again he should die.

Well, afore the dance was over off she slipped, and home she went, and when the maids came home she was framing to be asleep with her cap o' rushes on.

Well, next day they says to her, 'There, Cap o' Rushes, you didn't come last night, and now you won't see the lady, for there's no more dances.'

'Well, I should ha' rarely liked to ha' seen her,' says she.

The master's son he tried every way to find out where the lady was gone, but go where he might, and ask whom he might, he never heard nothing about her. And he got worse and worse for the love of her till he had to keep his bed.

'Make some gruel for the young master,' they says to the cook. 'He's dying for love of the lady.' The cook she set about making it when Cap o' Rushes came in.

'What are you a doin' on?' says she.

'I'm going to make some gruel for the young master,' says the cook, 'for he's dying for love of the lady.'

'Let me make it,' says Cap o' Rushes.

Well, the cook wouldn't at first, but at last she said yes, and Cap o' Rushes made the gruel. And when she had made it she slipped the ring into it on the sly before the cook took it up- stairs.

The young man he drank it and he saw the ring at the bottom.

'Send for the cook,' says he.

So up she comes.

'Who made this here gruel?' says he.

'I did,' says the cook, for she were frightened.

And he looked at her.

'No, you didn't,' says he. 'Say who did it, and you shan't be harmed

'Well, then, 'twas Cap o' Rushes,' says she.

'Send Cap o' Rushes here,' says he.

So Cap o' Rushes came.
'Did you make my gruel?' says he.

'Yes, I did,' says she.

'Where did you get this ring?' says he.

'From him as gave it me,' says she.

'Who are you then?' says the young man.

'T'll show you,' says she. And she offed with her cap o' rushes, and there she was in her beautiful clothes.

Well, the master's son h got well very soon, and they was to be married in a little time. It was to be a very grand wedding, and everyone was asked far and near. And Cap o' Rushes' father was asked. But she never told nobody who she was,

But before the wedding she went to the cook and says she,

'I want you to dress every dish without a mite o' salt.'

'That'll be rarely nasty,' says the cook.

'That don't signify,' says she.

'Very well,' says the cook.

Well, the wedding-day came, and they was married. And after they was married all the company sat down to their vittles. When they began to eat the meat, that was so tasteless *they couldn't eat it. But Cap o' Rushes' father he tried first one dish and then another, and then he burst out crying.

'What is the matter?' said the master's son to him.

'Oh!' says he, 'I had a daughter. And I asked her how much she loved me. And she said, " As much as fresh meat loves salt." And I turned her from my door, for I thought she didn't love me. And now I see she loved me best of all. And she may be dead for aught I know.'

'No, father, here she is!' says Cap o' Rushes. And she goes up to him and puts her arms round him.

And so they was happy ever after.

A. W. T. `[Who was Suffolk Notes and Queries contributor A.W.T. ?]`

How many thousands of years has this legend wandered from mouth to mouth of alien men! First take the name 'Cap o' Rushes.' That answers to the Coat of Rushes, Rashin Coatie, which the Scottish Cinderella wears, in Chambers's 'Popular Traditions of Scotland.' But these rushes come nowhere else, as far as I know, among the disguises of Peau d'Ane, for this heroine of Cap o' Rushes is more like Peau d'Ane (the tale La Fontaine and Perrault rhymed) than like Cinderella. Then take the tests of love. Here is a fragment that was caught up from tradition into the highest heaven of poetry in 'King Lear.' Then the girl's answer, 'As fresh meat loves salt,' is found, Mr. Clodd tells me, in Miss Maivé Stokes's Indian fairy tales (Tale 23). But the Suffolk narrator could not read or write, and is little likely to have plagiarised an idea from Miss Maivé Stokes, whose Indian Ayah, again, never plagiarised from Suffolk. The use of a ring, not a slipper, to cause the recognition, is found in Madame Emmy Schreck's Finnish form of 'Cinderella.' Note how Suffolk fancy economises in miracle: Cap o' Rushes has fine clothes of her own, and needs no friendly beast, no fairy godmother, to provide them for her. We have no king here, but 'a very rich gentleman,' and no 'fairy prince with happy eyes and lighter-footed than the fox,' but merely 'the master's son.' Then how different the position of Cap o' Rushes' father! In Peaw d'Ane he has an unholy passion for the girl, and to escape this she flees into the world. But Suffolk takes a 'King Lear' opening, and ends it happily with an idea from Hindostan. The English, too, is very plain and pleasant; it is a work-a-day, unassuming English story, with the romance reduced to the lowest possible power. Certainly there must be more English märchen, if people happy enough to live in the country would only take a little trouble to collect them.

Summary

A princess is banished after telling the king she loves him as meat loves salt, but he learns his mistake.

A vain king asked each of his three daughters how much she loved him. The youngest said, "I love you as fresh meat loves salt." The king was offended and banished her from the kingdom. Some years later the king and his men were out hunting. They killed a deer and stopped at an inn, where the king ordered the animal cooked for his dinner. He was given an unsalted piece. He demanded salt, and the serving girl revealed herself as his banished daughter. The king realised his mistake and took his daughter back.

transcript whisper

There was once upon a time that lived at King and he had three beautiful daughters and the man adored his daughters. But he was a very very vain King and nothing in the world pleased him.

And he went away for six months on something of a crusade and when he came back he said to his three daughters. He says I want to tell how much you love me and the first daughter says "oh father I love you as a son loves the earth and blesses the flowers".

And oh he cuddles and kisses his daughter.

And he says to the second daughter "and how do you love me?" She says "Father, I love you as a star's love the heavens. And there's so beautiful and brightness for my love for you". And she cuddles and kisses at him.

And she says to his younger daughter, "And how much do you love me?"

And she says, "Father, I love you as fresh meat loves salt."

And at first he took umbrage. He was highly offended. He says, "How dare you insult me by saying you love me as fresh meat loves salt. He says, it's a ghastly thing to say about me. Surely his ego was hurt, his pride was hurt, his vanity was hurt. And he said "I banish you from my kingdom. You do not love me at all. I thought you'd say how your other sisters would love me. You have made me most angry and you've banished her through the kingdom."

Poor Lassie was sent about with a penny. Her hair had been dressed in and the ken peasant's clothes sent above the court.

A few years passed by and that's what it came, his vane came, without hunting, wi' his men. And they got a deer, a beautiful tender fowl deer, and they took it here and they stopped it and inn, they took it and they stopped it and it. And he says to the landlord, "I want you to have this deer beautifully prepared and we'll keep part of it in here for my spending the night here on my journey home to the castle."

And he said it will be done. So he has beautiful deers of innocence put out there. And the serving lassie, and his bairn, and she serves him. And she serves a king, and the king can't even understand why he's been served last, but she'll put you in a special piece of meat for him, and he gets a speed of meat.

He takes a wee bit to him, and he spits it out, and he says, "Girl," he says, "take this food back, it's dreadful, it's absolutely dreadful!"

And she says, "but why is it dreadful?"

"I'll do what he else has eaten theirs."

"This meat is not cooked", she says. "It's no taste, it's not salt in it."

She says, "Oh, but you can't take meat with salt."

She says, "Don't be stupid." She says, "Whoever heard of anybody eating meat without salt."

She says, "No, no," she says, "You're not getting any meat salt for your meat."

And of course, the crew stopped and wondered why the king's nae getting their salt.

And he said, "I am the king." He says, "How can you dare say to me you're not giving me any salt with my meat?"

She said, "I was your daughter, and you banished me for saying, because I said I loved you as fresh meat, loved salt."

And the man looks up and sees this person, laughs, and says, "I'm your same daughter."

So he realizes at last he's made a mistake how selfish he'd been.

He says, "Well, perhaps it was my own vanity."

He says, "Perhaps I'll learn from the more humble."

He says, "Now, I've got a point. I really much... you did love me."

"You loved me more, because other girls just praised me for the sake of getting praised."

"But you loved me more than really any of them, by saying the fresh meat loves salt."

So he took his daughter back, and she became the favourite princess in the court.

The Most Indispensable Thing
Germany
Ages ago there lived a king who had three good and beautiful daughters whom he loved very much and who in turn loved him dearly. He had no princes, but in his kingdom it was the custom that the succession of the throne could also pass to women and daughters. Because the king's wife was no longer alive he was free to appoint one of his daughters to the throne, and it did not need to be the oldest one.

Because this king loved all of his daughters equally the decision was very difficult for him. He came to the conclusion to select the one who demonstrated the keenest intellect. He shared this determination with his three daughters, declaring that his approaching birthday would be the day of decision. The one who would bring him "the most indispensable thing" would become queen.

Each of the princesses thought about what would be the most indispensable thing. When his birthday arrived, the oldest one approached him, carrying a fine purple robe, and said, "The Lord God had mankind come naked into the world, but then he barred them from paradise. Thus robes and clothing are indispensable."

The second daughter brought a loaf of fresh bread that she herself had baked. It was lying on top of a filled beaker made of gold. "Food and drink are the most indispensable things for mankind, born from dust, for without these they cannot live. Thus God created the fruits of the field, fruit, berries, and grapes, and taught mankind to make bread and wine, the sacred symbols of his love."

The youngest daughter brought a pile of salt on a wooden plate, saying, "My father, I consider salt and wood to be the most indispensable. Ancient peoples paid sacred homage to the trees and considered salt to be holy.

The king was very surprised with these gifts. Thinking about them, he said, "Purple is the most indispensable thing for a king, for if he has it, he has everything else. If he loses it, then he is no longer king and is as common as other humans. Because you have perceived this, my oldest and beloved daughter, after me you shall be decorated with royal purple. Come to me and receive my thanks and my blessing!"

After kissing and blessing his oldest daughter, he said to the second oldest, "Eating and drinking are not altogether necessary, my good child, and they draw us down entirely too much into commonness. They are a sign of mediocrity and of the masses. I cannot hinder you if you find pleasure therein, nor can I thank you for your poorly chosen gift, but you shall be blessed for your good will." Then the king blessed his daughter, but he did not kiss her.

Then he turned to the third princess, who was standing there pale and trembling. After what she had seen and heard, she sensed what was to come.

"My daughter, on your wooden plate you may well have some salt, but in your brain you have none," said the king. "You are still alive, and therefore salt is not indispensable. One does not need salt. With your salt you are showing the sense of a peasant, not the sense of a king. And I take no pleasure on that stiff wooden thing. Thus I can neither thank you nor bless you. Go away from me, as far as your feet will carry you. Go to the stupid and coarse people who worship old blocks of wood and tree limbs instead of the living God, and who consider common salt to be sacred."

Crying, the youngest princess then turned away from her hard father, and walked far, far away from the court and the royal city, as far as her feet would carry her.

She came to an inn and offered her services to the female innkeeper. The innkeeper was touched by her humility, innocence, youth, and beauty, and she took her in as a maid. The princess soon mastered all the household duties, and the innkeeper said, "It would be a pity if the girl did not learn a decent skill. I'll teach her to cook."

And thus the princess learned to cook. She grasped everything quickly, and soon could cook some dishes even better and more delicious than the teacher herself. Business improved at the inn because of the good cooking there, and the good cook's reputation -- who was also so young and so beautiful -- spread throughout the entire land.

Now it came to pass that this cook's father's oldest daughter was about to be married. A royal wedding was to be held, and it was recommended to bring the famous cook to the court to prepare the feast, for the lords at the royal court, the marshals, the royal wine stewards, the royal dining stewards, the masters of ceremony, the chamberlains, and other excellencies did not share the view that their most gracious lord the king had once expressed, that eating and drinking were not altogether necessary and that they draw us down to commonness. To the contrary, they praised all good food and fine wine and honored -- at least inwardly -- that old and true proverb, "Eating and drinking hold body and soul together."

The wedding meal was deliciously prepared, nor was the king's favorite dish lacking, which had been specially ordered by the royal dining steward. The meal was served. There came one dish after the other, and each was highly praised.

Finally came the king's favorite dish, and it was served first to him. He tried it and found it completely tasteless. His cheerful mood darkened, and he spoke to the chamberlain standing behind his golden armchair, "This dish is ruined! It is terrible! Stop the platters from being passed around, and summon the cook!"

The cook entered the magnificent hall, and the king addressed her, "You have ruined my favorite dish. You have spoiled my pleasure by not putting any salt in my favorite dish!"

Then the cook fell at the king's feet, saying with humility, "Have mercy, your majesty, my royal lord, and forgive me! How could I have dared to mix salt into your food? Did I not once hear from a lofty king's own mouth the words, " One does not need salt. Salt is not indispensable. Salt shows only the sense of a peasant, not the sense of a king!"

With shame the king recognized these words as his own and the cook as his daughter. Lifting her from the floor where she was kneeling, he drew her to his heart. He then told all the wedding guests her story and had his youngest daughter once again be seated by his side.

Then the wedding became doubly joyful, and the king was once again entirely happy with his daughter's love.

Salt is holy.

The Necessity of Salt
Austria
Once upon a time there was a king who had three daughters. Because they were good and beautiful he loved them all sincerely. He did not know which one he should appoint as queen.

As his birthday approached he summoned his daughters and said to them, "My dear children, I love all three of you sincerely, and for a long time have not known which one of you I should name to be the heir to my throne. But I have now decided that the one of you shall become queen who brings to me a birthday present that is most necessary in human life. Go and make your plans accordingly and with utmost diligence."

The old king's birthday arrived, and the two oldest daughters brought him presents that were very necessary, but at the same time extremely expensive. However, the youngest daughter brought him nothing more than a little pile of salt in a decorated container. When the king saw her present he became very angry, and he drove his daughter out of the castle, forbidding her ever again to let herself be seen by him.

With deep sorrow the rejected daughter went out into the unknown world, comforted only by her faith in her own good sense. After walking a good while she came to an inn. There she found a female innkeeper who thoroughly understood cooking. She entered an apprenticeship with her and soon exceeded even the innkeeper in the art of cooking.

News spread far and wide of the excellent cook in this inn, and everyone who came this way and who still had a few kreuzers left in his pocket stopped to be served a roast or something even more elegant.

The king heard of the cook's reputation, and he hired her as court cook. Now it came to pass that the oldest princess was getting married, and the famous cook was assigned the preparation of the wedding feast, with no expenses to be spared.

Thus on the wedding day one elegant dish after the other was served until the table almost cracked. Everything was excellently prepared, and everyone praised the cook. Finally the king's favorite dish arrived. Quickly taking a spoon he tasted it. "This has not been salted!" he cried out angrily. "Have the cook brought before me!"

They quickly ran for the cook, who entered the hall undaunted.

"Why did you forget to salt my favorite dish, you careless girl?" snapped the king at her.

The cook answered, "You drove away your youngest daughter because she thought that salt was so necessary. Perhaps you can now see that your child was not so wrong."

When the king heard these words he recognized his daughter, begged her for forgiveness, asked her to be seated at his side, and accepted her once again as his dear child. Then the wedding became doubly joyful.

The king lived happily with his children for many years thereafter.
