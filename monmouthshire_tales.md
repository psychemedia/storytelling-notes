Riddle-Story from the Wye Valley.

(*Ante* p. 178.)

"Gone a-hunting; and all the game he kills he leaves behind, and all as he doesn't kill he brings home alive."

The riddle recorded by Miss Eyre from the Wye Valley must be of venerable antiquity, as Homer himself is said to have "given it up." It is found in the *Homeric Epigrams*, a collecton of odd scraps which are neither Homeric nor epigrammatic; one or two of the poems (notably the Potters Song and the Eiresione) are well-known to folklorists. The story is told in the Pseudo-Herodotean Life of Homer, with variants in other "lives" of Homer (the references are collected by Abel, *Homeric Hymns*, etc., p. 126 f.). In the course of his wanderings Homer met some fishermen, and on asking about their catch received the answer,

MJTT* AiiriJ/AE-CF l?'' DCTQ. 0 OTJ^ cXoflGV, C^EpQjU£flT^CL

"We have left all we caught, and bring all we did not catch." According to one version, which the Pseudo-Herodotean biographer is at pains to reject, Homer died of vexation at his failure to solve the riddle. It is difficult to suppose that the Wye Valley borrowed from Greece; and the riddle may well have been invented independently. Does it occur elsewhere?

Rue, hyssop, and wormwood should be put in the coffin. Before starting for the burial-ground there should be singing in the house. The corpse should be carried out at the front door feet first, and should then be turned with its face to the east. In Ross funeral cakes made like hot cross buns are baked, and a dole is given to the bearers, consisting of a coin, which may be a penny, sixpence, shilling, or upwards, one for each man. (Mrs. Briton says a relative of hers gave eight half-crowns.) These coins are always given in a pair of kid gloves.

Wizardry on the Welsh Border. Beatrix A. Wherry, pp75-87

Wizardry on the Welsh Border.

(Read at Meetings 17th February, 1904)

[The following article, by a young lady who is still at school, is inserted in all its fulness of picturesque detail partly on account of the admirable object lesson it affords in the collection of folklore. Boys and girls have a great advantage in this work in the ease with which they can vanquish the barriers of racial or class prejudice, which are after all the main difficulties to be overcome. Miss Wherry has given fictitious names to her informants, but the genuineness of her narratives must be self-evident to any one who knows the garrulous dramatic visionary folk of the Welsh Marches. Readers will not fail also to note the close correspondence of the relative positions of witch and wise man in Monmouthshire with those of the witch and witch-doctor in Central Africa, as described in the preceding paper. — Ed.]

While staying at a farmhouse in Monmouthshire this summer, I tried to collect some stories about the wise men, ghosts, and superstitions of the place. I was indebted to our landlady, Mrs. Briton, for many of them, but she referred me to an old Mrs. Pryce, who, she said, could tell me more stories than anyone.

I first made the acquaintance of Mrs. Pryce in the stable-yard wishing to sell a "fine oak table." She was a weird-looking figure in her heavy cloak and cottage bonnet, but the most striking feature about her was the curious penetrating brightness of her eyes. Next day we all trooped down to see the table in her cottage at Trelleck. She was more witch-like than ever; so much so that I looked around for the black cat, which, however, was not forthcoming; she gave long histories of the usual six children whom she had buried, also of her quarrels with her landlord. She also wished to sell some chairs, for she said, "I've no need of chairs, being all alone, and I have the bench I used to kill pigs upon, 'twill not be used for that agen, so I may so well sit on it so long as I do live."

Two or three days afterwards she came up for the money for her table. Drawing me mysteriously out of the room she whispered on the stairs, "They're after me for the rent." She got her money and was then prevailed upon to "take a drop o' cider." I then took the opportunity of asking her if she knew anything about Jenkyns, the wise man, in whom I was very much interested, having heard a great deal about him.

"Lor' bless you, me dear," said she, "Why, Jenkyns 'as been a comfort to me all me life. If I ever 'ad a pain of any sort, rheumaticks, toothache, or what ye like, if I'd go to Jenkyns 'e'd always take it away. Anything that were lost, in all the country-side, 'e'd always find it. 'Deed I did miss old Jenkyns when 'e died, and many's the time I've wished 'im back agen."

I asked her what old Jenkyns' appearance was, and gathered that he was an oldish man, with a long dark beard; stooping, and walking with a stick. "He allus wore one o' those box 'ats," said Mrs. Pryce, "an' an old round coat about the house, but when 'e went to town 'e put on a long coat with tails,"

"But have you ever seen any of his charming, Mrs. Pryce?"

"Lor' bless you, yes, me dear," said she; "many an' many a time, but onst in particular I were dreadful skeered, an' I'll tell you all about it. One day one of me brothers had a toothache, so him an' me an' me other brother went up to old Jenkyns to have it charmed away. Jenkyns could charm away anything; many a time, when I've had rheumaticks or pain of any sort I'd go to Jenkyns an' say, 'Oh! Jenkyns, I do feel so bad, take away my pain, do now;' 'an' 'e'd say,' 'Well now, d'ye believe?' 'Oh, yes, I believe,' say I, an' there! the pain 'ud be gone.

"Well, as I was sayin', when the toothache was gone, Jenkyns went out o' the kitchen to fetch a drop o' cider, an' me brother see'd a big, big book on the comer of the table, an' began to look at it. Jenkyns hollers out from the other side of the house, 'Don't you touch that book, or it'll be the worse for you!' When 'e came back me brother says, 'You must have got the Old Man 'imself about 'ere to have such like goings on,' says 'e. Just then there came a great noise in the room above, bowling about the floor, like as if a great big ball were rollin' about 'All right,' says Jenkyns, 'if you don't look out, youll have him a bit closer.'

"With that 'e takes a candle an' blows into it, puts it on the table, an' draws a circle round it. Then the light all burnt dim an' blue, and the whole room got cloudy an' misty. Presently, we see'd a little old man sittin' in a chair next to Jenkyns, 'e was rockin' 'imself to and fro, and squeakin', 'Jenky, Jenky, Jenky!' an' again, 'Jenky, Jenky, Jenky!' Now 'e 'adn't come thro' the door, 'cos that was locked; an' 'e 'adn't come thro' the window, 'cos that was shut an' barred; an' yet there e' was, sittin' in the chair, calling 'Jenky, Jenky, Jenky!' an' 'Jenky, Jenky, Jenky!' Then Jenkyns blew into the candle agen, an' the dim blue light went away, an' the candle burned clear, an' lo an' behold! that little grey old man was vanished.

"'There!' says Jenkyns; but me brothers didn't wait to hear any more; they just took to their heels an' set off home as if the Old Man were after them, leavin' me to follow as best I could. But I believe to this day 'twas the Old Gentleman himself as we saw."

I asked her what had become of the big book, and what was in it, but she did not know, though she thought that the books were left to a nephew who had disappeared. She did not know the contents of them either, but said that "the Bible was a great book with him!" I had no time to ask any more questions, for Mrs. Pryce was launched on another story.

"One day there was a young man goin' to Monmouth races, an' as 'e was passin' 'is field, 'e see'd the cattle 'atin' of 'is crops. So 'e up an' took 'is jacket off an' throwed it over the gate, an druv' 'em off; but when 'e come back 'is jacket was gone. Now there was an 'ooman round there as 'e knowed 'ud take anything, but o' course 'e 'oodn't miss the Monmouth races, an' so 'e went without 'is jacket. But when 'e came back 'e told 'is wife, an' she told 'im to go off to old Jenkyns an' 'e'd get it back for 'im. Well, old Jenkyns 'e said, 'That 'ooman wont rest till she come an' put your coat back on the gate where she took'd it from. But what'll I do to punish 'er?'

"'Oh!' said the young man, 'don't do anything to hurt her, so long as I gets me jacket back.'

"'Well,' says the old Jenkyns, ' 'ow 'ud it be if I was to put the button 'ole on her cheek, just 'ere, under 'er eye?'

"'All right,' says the young man.

"An', sure enough, that 'ooman come'd n' put back that jacket on the gate, where she tooked it from; but ever arterwards she 'ad the mark of a black button-hole on 'er cheek, just beside 'er eye, so as everyone should know what sort of an 'ooman she was."

"But have you seen the mark, Mrs. Pryce?" I said.

"Why yes, me dear," said Mrs, Pryce, "t'was old So-and-so;" and with that she gave me her whole pedigree. "An' many a time have I seen that mark," said she. "Oh, Jenkyns always punished people when they stole things; there was those folk down to Pen-y-van, they had a bad time of it, I'll tell you about that. There was a farmer down by Pen-y-van, an' 'e 'ad a lot o' cider, but that all got stolen by four people. So 'e went to old Jenkyns to see what was to be done. But ole Jenkyns, 'Tisn't no good,' says he, 'the cider's drinked; I can't get it back for you, 'cos it's all drinked; but I'll tell you what I'll do,' says 'e; 'you come along to the green at six o'clock to-morrer evening, an' I'll make 'em dance;' an' sure enough he coom'd, an' there was these four people dancin' away on the green, men an' women. An' they couldn't help it, 'cos old Jenkyns 'ad put a spell on them, an' they danced for two hours for punishment, till 'e tooked the spell off. An' there was hundreds o' people watchin' 'em. Old Ann Griffiths, she told me all about it, how they was dancin' and jumpin' about, an' all the time ready to drop. Old Jenkyns, 'e was a watchin' quite pleased like for some time; then 'e got tired, tooked the spell off an' went home."

"An' it's not the first time 'e's punished people like that," said Mrs. Briton. "Don't you remember that 'ooman at the public down to Grosmont?" and she started on her story, Mrs. Pryce now and then putting in a nod of approval

"One day old Jenkyns was going down town, an' 'e stopped at a public, 'The Cock and Feather,' to get some refreshment 'E asked for bread an' cheese an' beer; when 'e'd finished 'e asked 'ow much it was. 'Oh,' says the landlady, 'lef s see, six an' four's ten, that's tenpence, please.' Jenkyns said, 'twas too much, but 'e paid 'is tenpence an' went off.

"Presently the 'ooman came back into the room an' went up to the place where Jenkyns had been sitting, an' calls out,

"Six an' four's ten.  
Here's off agen.'

"An' she started runnin' round the table, an' when she came back to Jenkyns' place she called out again,

"'Six an' four's ten.  
Here's off agan.'

"An' started ninnin' round agen. Presently 'er daughter came in an' seed 'er mother runnin' round the table an' callin' out, so she knowed she'd got a spell on 'er. She went on like that for an hour and a half, then 'er son came back from work an' see'd 'is mother runnin' round the table, callin' out,

"Six an' four's ten.  
Here's off agen.'

"So 'e said, "Why, mother, what's t' matter?'"

An' she says, 'Oh, I don't know!

"'Six an' four's ten,  
Here's off" agen.'

"So 'e said to 'is sister, ''As so-an'-so been 'ere?' an' she said 'e 'ad, an' 'e said, ''Ow long's 'e been gone?' an' she said, 'Two hour.'

"So 'e went an' caught up old Jenkyns an' tells 'im what was wrong, an' Jenkyns says, 'Serve 'er right for chaigin' a poor man tenpence for a bit o' bread an' cheese. But,' 'e says, 'you go an' look under a candlestick on your mantelpiece; there youll see a bit of paper. Don't you look at it or it'll be the worse for you, but throw it in the fire. An' I hope this'll be a lesson to yer mother.'

"So the son went home, an' there was 'is mother, still runnin' round an' calling out,

"Six an' four's ten,  
Here's off" agen.'

"'E ran to the chimney-piece, there was the paper! an' 'e throwed it in the fire; 'is mother dropped into a chair, all exhausted like. An' it served 'er right."

Mrs. Briton stopped, quite exhausted, for she had been acting the story herself all the time, rushing round the table and shouting,

"Six an' four's ten,  
Here's off agen."

Mrs. Pryce and I were simply screaming with laughter, and it was some time before Mrs. Pryce went on, with a rather disjointed story about a witch:

"One day some folk came to old Jenkyns about a witch; they told 'im 'ow she used to turn herself into a hare an' stand on an old gate-post an' frighten folk terrible. Once there was some men goin' by an' they see'd 'er on the post, an' she called out

"Pee wow, pee wow!' and jumped down; an' they all runned away. So old Jenkyns he says, *You follow after her,' says 'e, 'an' stick a knife into 'er *third 'eel-mark*, then you'll be rid of her.' Now this old witch had put a spell on a woman in the village, so 'er husband an' 'er brother said they'd pay 'er out.

"They see'd the old lady goin' along the road one day, an' so in the third heel-mark from where she was they stuck a knife into the ground. She set up such a screechin' you could a' heard it for miles. 'Oo told you to do that' says she, an' begins sayin' things most awful. Then she went off limpin' like, as if a knife was put right thro' 'er foot So you see old Jenkyns 'e knew 'ow to settle witches, 'e did. Twas a pity he never see'd them on the Buckle. I'll tell you about them.

"One day there was a man going down the Buckle pitch, an' as 'e was goin' along, all of a sudden 'e 'eard sumthin' a comin' down behind 'im, an' 'e looked an' there 'e saw an old 'ooman a comin' gallopin' down the pitch on a piece of an old hurdle. She come right past 'im, an' 'e tried to catch hold of the hurdle; but no, 'e couldn't touch it, nohow. Then there came along another old hag, leppin' an' gallopin' on a ladder, an' behind her came another, as I'm alive, trundlin' on a common grindstone! They came right past 'im, an' on to a public beyond the pitch, an' there they stopped, an' them that wasn't too frightened tried to shoot 'em, but no, nothing couldn't touch 'em, nobody could catch hold of that hurdle, nor the ladder, nor the grindstone neither; an' presently they called, 'Pee wow. Pee wow!' 'an' was off again, so as nobody couldn't stop 'em."

"Well, now I'd like to have seen that," said Mrs. Briton. "I expect you'll be practising on one o' them old grindstones, won't you, to see if you can get along same as the witches?"

"Talkin' of witches," said Mrs. Pryce, "there was a wise woman way over the mountains some time ago, as I heard tell of. She could find anything that were lost. One day there was a man that had a very fine watch, an' 'e put it on the table one day while 'e went to clean 'isself, an' when 'e come back 'twas gone. So 'is mother went off 'way over the mountains to this old 'ooman. Jes' as she came up to the door a little dog run out barking. Then there came out a little, little old 'ooman. 'Don't you be afraid o' the dog,' says she; 'I know what you's come about. Twas your own niece as took the watch. You go back 'ome an' look under the stone next the pump in your scullery, an' there youll find it,' says she. 'An' will you have 'er that took it punished?' said she. But the 'ooman thanked her, and said so long as she got the watch back, she didn't care to punish any one, much less her own niece. So she went back, an' there sure 'nough she found the watch under a stone in the scullery. Now, weren't that strange, as the old 'ooman who'd never seen the place should know where the thing was?"

This was the last story Mrs. Pryce told me. Mrs. Briton, however, remembered some more about Jenkyns, and one day, when I was mangling for her, she told me the following:

"One day old Jenkyns was comin' up from Monmouth, and just on the pitch by the station was four horses strugglin' an' strainin' to drag a great piece of timber up the hill. They were pullin' an' men were pushin', an' then they'd be pulled back by the weight of it Jenkyns, he looked at them for some time, then he up an' shouts, 'Unhitch that fore horse!' So they unhitched him, 'cos nobody dared disobey anything that Jenkyns told them to do. 'Now hitch 'im on behind,' 'e said; an' so they hitched 'im on behind. Then Jenkyns tooked the whip, cracked it, an' shouted, 'Now, me lads, all together!' An' would you believe it, them 'orses that couldn't move a step before, galloped up the hill like a top spinnin', an' the leader dancin' behind!"

Another day I cornered Mrs. Briton in the dairy, and bargained for a story. "Well," she said, "I'll tell you what I know 'bout old Sarah Griffiths. They used to say she was a witch, an' this was told me by old Jacob Jones 'isself, an' 'e ought to know. So if it's a lie, it's 'is own lie.

"It 'appened when Mr. Mason was livin' at the Argoed. 'Is gardener was very particler 'bout havin' turf from the 'ill, an' they 'ad ter bring it across the river in boats, an' old Tom Griffiths an' Jacob Jones, they was 'elpin'. Well, on the last day, when they'd got it all up, Mr. Mason's gardener, 'e left some money down at the Boat Inn, so as they should 'ave some beer, 'cause 'e was pleased they'd brought the turf up so quick. So Tom, when 'e went up to tea, 'e says to Sarah, 'e was goin' down for an hour, cos they was goin' to 'ave some singin' down at the 'Boat'; but Sarah, she said, 'Thee shassent go down theer; thee'st better stay at 'ome 'an 'ave thee's supper.'

"Well, Tom, 'e would'nt stay, so she said, 'If thee goes down theer, thee bis'nt comin' 'ome to-night' An' she began to curse an' swear, an' say she wished the devil 'ud run off with 'im if 'e went down, but still 'e went.

"Well, 'e was a comin' up again, about ten, with old Jacob Jones, an' Jacob was a little way in front; 'e was a tellin' me about it arterwards. 'E said, 'It's as true as my hand's there,' 'e said, 'I felt myself goin' up, up, an' it took me breath away, it was so swift, an' I went up right over the hedge.' It were one of those 'igh 'edges all over dog-briars an' blackberry branches. An' 'e went right over, sheer down into the meadow the other side. Presently 'e 'eard some 'un swearin' close by, an' 'e said, 'Tom, is that thee? What f devil art doin' theer? 'An' Tom said, 'Jacob is that thee? What t' devil art doin' heer?'

"An' then they tried to get out, but they couldn't, an' they was all scrat about, an' bruised, an' cut, an' try as they might they couldn't get out, they was so buried in briars an' brambles. They lay there swearin' an' talkin' to one another till half-past five in the mornin', when they 'eard Dan an' Tom, their two boys, comin' up home from the dnworks. Then Jacob 'e called out 'Lor' bless thee, Dan, is that thee? Coom an' get us out o' this!'

"An' them two boys 'ad the greatest difficulty in gettin' 'em out, they was so stuck in them briars an' things. But at last they got out, an' when they got 'ome, there was old Sally boilin' the kettle, an' she said, 'I telled thee, Tom, thee oosn't come 'ome, an' thee didn't'

"There's another story I've just remembered about a witch," said Mrs. Briton; "I'll just tell you about it.

"There was an old witch used to live 'bout here, an' she had a daughter. Now there was a young man very fond of this girl, and wanting to marry her, but her mother hated him, and would have liked to have put him out of the way if she could.

"One day he came up to see his sweetheart, and there was her mother a brewin' somethin' in a saucepan on the fire. She says, 'Tom, do 'ee take t' kettle an' bring me some water from the well.' But the girl called out, 'Don't 'ee go, Tom. Oh! don't 'ee go.' 'You be quiet, ye interfering hussy,' says the old 'ooman. 'Here, Tom, take t' kettle.'

"So Tom took the kettle an' went off to the well, an' dipped it in; but 'e felt somethin' a pullin' an' pushin' him till it got 'is 'ead right under water as 'twere tryin' to drown him. O' course 'e struggled and kicked till 'e got 'is 'ead up again, an' then 'e looked round to see who 'twere, but there — there war'nt no one.

"'E couldn't see no one, but in two minutes somethin' had 'im again and got 'im under the water, an' all this time 'e couldn't get the kettle filled anyway. Three times 'e were took an' dipped in the well, an' it were a wonder 'e weren't drowned, for 'twas all 'e could do to keep 'is 'ead up. At last 'e got the kettle filled an' went back to the cottage.

"There was the old 'ooman still brewin' in the saucepan an' mutterin' to herself; but when she saw 'im that she thought was drowned come to the door with the kettle full she stopped all of a sudden an' looked at 'im that awful, an' a sort of a horrid laugh came out of the saucepan, an' the lid jumped off an' flew right up the chimney so as all the kitchen was filled with smoke an' the most awful smell. Then 'e knowed she 'ad been brewin' spells to kill 'im, so 'e dropped the kettle an' took to 'is 'eels, an' all up the road 'e could 'ear 'er cursin' 'im, an' I take it 'e was glad to get 'ome. But 'e never went after that girl agen."

Mrs. Briton is one of the few people from whom you can get ghost stories first hand; they are rather vague, but she believes in them implicitly.

"One day," she said, "our cattle got lost an' our two boys went out to look for them. They was out for hours an' hours, an' towards evening Bill Roberts brought the cattle home, but 'e 'adn't seen them boys. So I began to get anxious like, an' I went out all over the place huntin' an' callin' for them. At last it got quite dark, an' I was in an awful state o' mind: I put a lamp in the window to guide them if they was to come back, an' went out with my father to look for them again. We was just goin' past the house of a wicked, wicked old man what had just died (they told all kinds of stories about him, some said as 'e had killed 'is own wife); as I was sayin' we was passin' this house, an' I saw just beside me a big, big, black dog, as large as a calf, an' 'is eyes shone like lumps of fire. My father hit at it with 'is stick, an', would you believe me, the stick went right through it, an' 'twas still there!

"Bye-an'-bye, when we'd passed the house, the dog disappeared.

"'That's a sure token,' says my father, 'that them boys is in the river!'

"Well, you may believe that made me feel bad, but when we got 'ome the lamp was gone out of the window, an' I rushed upstairs, there was the boys fast asleep. Next momin' they told me how they'd got so tired an' gone to sleep in the road, an' woken up when it was dark an' come on home. But that day a telegram come to say as my brother 'ad been killed by a railway truck. So, you see, it was an omen, seeing that there dog."

There is a funny old house on the way to Penallt called the "Potash"; it is said to be haunted, but Mrs. Briton is the only person I have met who has seen anything there. This is her account:

"One night about twelve o'clock I was goin' along the road down to Mitchel Troy, where we used to live; I was just nearin' the 'Potash' when I heard like a lot of people talkin' in the air. First I thought 'twas the gypsies, but as I was comin' by the hedge in the field I saw a sort of a black cloud comin' thro' the gap, an' I heard a sound of dankin' chains, but all at once I knowed it wasn't gypsies 'cos they weren't there, an' I heard voices all around. I ran, an' ran, I was so frightened, till at last I fell right into a sand pit at the bottom of the hill."

Some other members of Mrs. Briton's family have seen visions too. Her son, Samuel, told me that one night, goin' up through Troy Woods, he had seen a great black beast with flaming eyes, and when he turned his lantern on it, it vanished with a sort of screech into a ditch.

Mr. Briton is said by his wife to have seen a black dog going nine times round a tree; I don't know if that is true, but after much cross-questioning, and with additions from Mrs. Briton, I made out that he really had seen something one night, when going to see his wife, who was nursing a sick woman in a him some way off. By the side of the road he saw a lady, dressed in a very old-fashioned way, holding her skirt up; her hair, of a sandy colour, was divided and arranged in two knots on the top of her head. Though it was a pitch-dark night he saw her plainly, and said "Good night;" but she passed him without speaking, and vanished up the road. Mr. Briton riished into the farm where his wife was, and told her be had seen the devil.

"Had 'e got a tail?" said she, laughing.

"No, but 'e had horns," he said; for he thought she had, from the way her hair was arranged.

"You should have followed her, and she'd have shown you a treasure if you'd asked her in God's name what she wanted," said Mrs. Briton sagely; and he wished he had.

"But, why did you think she was the devil?" I asked him. "Oh, I s'pose 'twas just a wicked thought of mine," he said.

I gathered some stories from Mrs. Briton about a mythical person, supposed to have come from Kentchurch `[TH: near Grosmont]` near by, who went by the name of Jack Kent. He is associated with the Druidical stones at Trelleck, and the cleft on the Skyrrid.

"They say that when Jacky was a little boy he made a compact with the devil, which enabled him to do anything he set his hand to.

"Once he was engaged by a farmer to scare crows; but there was a fair going on in the town, and Jack didn't mean to miss it, so he called all the crows together from all the fields round, and when they were all collected he sent them into an old barn, with no roof to it. But Jack put the crows in there and said something to them, and they couldn't get out, try as they might So Jack, he went to the fair, but when he had been enjoying himself there a bit, he met his master. (Now his master had specially told him he was not to go to the fair, or else the crows would be after the crops.) So the farmer said, 'Hullo, Jack, what art doin' here? Didn't I tell thee to look after th' crows?' But Jack says, 'T' crows be all right, master.' And he took the farmer to the old barn, and sure enough there was the crows, and they couldn't get out, altho' that barn had no roof, until Jack told them to. `[Cf. Folklore Journal, i., 370 [TH: actually, 379] (where Kent is misprinted Rent); also vol. ii., p. 10, and F. Hindes Groome's In Gipsy Tents (Nimmo), p. 11, whose version of the story has been heard in Shropshire also. — Ed.]`

"Jack bested the devil in everything. One day they were walking through a turnip-field, and Jack made a bet that he could get more profit out of the field, if they shared it, than the devil could. (The turnips weren't above ground then, but Jack knew they were there.) Jack asked the Old Boy if he'd have Tops or Bottoms. He said 'Tops,' so Jack got the turnips and the Old Boy the greens.

"Next year the Devil took the bet again, an' this time he made sure he'd win, so he said he'd have Bottoms; but Jack, be had took precautions, an' that field came up wheat, so he got the corn an' straw, an' the Devil got the roots, which of course wasn't much good.

"Then they went to threshing. Jack was to have Bottoms this time, so he got the barn floor, and the Devil went on top; so he put up a hurdle for the Devil to thresh on, and as he battered away Jack had all the corn on the floor.

"Then they made a bargain that Jack was to build a bridge over Trothy Weir, Grosmont, before the cock crowed in the morning, but Jack did not before the cock crowed, and there the stones lie to this day, many a ton.

"Jack did some wonderful things in his time. Why! one day he jumped off the Sugar Loaf Mountain on to the Skyrrid (and there's his heel-mark in the Skyrrid to this day). An' when he got there he began playing quoits, he pecked (threw) three stones as far as Trelleck, great, big ones, as tall as three men (and there they still stand in a field), and he threw another, but that didn't go quite far enough, and it lay on the Trelleck Road, just behind the five trees, till a little while ago, when it was moved so as the field might be ploughed; and this stone, in memory of Jack, was always called the Pecked Stone.

"The Devil swore he'd have Jack's soul whether he were buried inside or outside the church; but when Jack died he was buried just under the wall of Grosmont Church, with his head inside and his legs outside, and a great stone (which has since been moved) was put to mark the place. So the Devil never got him."

In Monmouthshire there is a curious custom called "New Year's Gifts." On New Year's Eve the village children bring round apples, with three sticks for legs, and surmounted by a sprig of box adorned with hazel-nuts, fastened on by slitting the nut at the top and inserting a leaf of the sprig. I have heard, too, that in the spring, when the crops are just beginning to sprout, the men go into the field, taking cider with them, light a fire, and "say something" over the corn. On Good Friday it is right to bake a small loaf, which is to be kept till the same date next year; it will not go bad. Some of this loaf ground up is a certain cure for various illnesses.

Mrs. Briton says that if you kill an adder, and before sundown hold it over a flame of fire, its four legs will come out. She has seen it!

Monmouthshire Folklore. (Ante, p. 85.)

Miss Wherry's charming Monmouthshire collections are a valuable addition to the lore of a county whose literature is all too undeveloped in this direction. "The mythical person" known as "Jack Kent," who is credited (p. 85) with so many diplomatic triumphs over the Evil One, is no other than Father John of Kentchurch, D.D., Provincial of the Franciscans, an Oxford professor, and a Welsh bard whose poems are yet extant in seventeenth century MSS. He lived in the fifteenth century, and having scientific knowledge, could hardly fail (any more than his brother Bacon) to get credit for magical powers. Some of the feats attributed to him are obviously gigantic, and have no doubt been transferred to him from some forgotten giant Such is his jumping off the Sugarloaf Mountain, near Abergavenny, on to the Skyrrid (the Sgiryd Fawr). His "heel-mark" in the latter mountain is an extensive pre-historic landslip, and is usually ascribed to the earthquake which took place at the Crucifixion. The Sgiryd Fawr was always regarded as sacred and mysterious. More than one Monmouthshire parish church was built on a mound formed of earth brought from this mountain; and it was the custom at the burial of Catholics, right down to the early nineteenth century, to sprinkle on the coffin earth brought from the chapel of Saint Michael, which stood on the slope near the landslip. Saint Michael's, or the Holy Mountain, were other names for the Great Sgiryd.

The belief (p. 86) that if one kills an adder and holds it over fire its four legs will come out, reminds one of the Jewish tradition that the serpent had legs and walked before Adam's fall. I have heard this belief referred to a "race-memory" of antediluvian reptiles.

The *Book of Baglan*, a celebrated Welsh MS. of Gwentian pedigrees, written 1607, twice mentions a certain giant, "Gigas Orgo" or "Giginn Orgo," to whom it attributes the first building of Abergavenny Castle. I cannot explain the word Giginn unless it be some obsolete Welsh word for *giant*, but in any case the combination "Giginn Orgo" involves a radical form Gorgo, in which one is much inclined to recognise the *Guorguol* or Werwolf of *Arthur and Gorlagon* (see Mr. Nutt's notes, p. 61). I may add that Orgo is the only giant I have met with in the folklore of Monmouthshire.

Hereford Journal - Wednesday 06 August 1851

JOHN O'KENT. In a recent number of the Athenaeum there appeared an account of a newly-discovered manuscript comedy Anthony Munday. The writer, Mr. J. Payne Collier, appears to have made many inquiries after the renowned "John Kent," or, as he is usually called in this county, "Jack o'Kent," and as it may be interesting to our readers, we reprint the letter, together with some particulars which have been since furnished by a correspondent, in answer to Mr. J. Payne Collier's remarks: "By the kindness of the Hon. E. M. L. M.P., I have in hands, for publication by the Shakspeare Society, a manuscript comedy entirely in the autograph of our great dramatist's celebrated contemporary, Anthony Munday—who signed his name at the end of it. It was found recently, amongst the papers and evidences belonging to Mr. Mostyn's family; and I can hardly estimate too highly our obligation to him for allowing us the unrestricted use of such valuable relic. Munday's reputation was so great at the period when he was writer for our stage as to lead distinguished critic of that day to pronounce him the "best plotter;" thus, for the construction of a dramatic story, placing him above Shakspeare, Marlow, Ben Jonson, Greene, and other theatrical rivals. " How far this character was deserved is another question which the discovery the remarkable literary curiosity in hands will, all events, enable us better to determine. " The scene is laid Chester and its vicinity; the Earl, his Countess, his daughter, his niece, Llewellen, Prince North Wales, the Prince South Wales, and the Earls Powis, Pembroke, and Morton being principal characters. Respecting all these no difficulty arises; but want information regarding two other personages who figure even more prominently, and on whom, in fact, the whole plot depends. refer to two wizards, or magicians, the one named John-a-Kent and the other Johna-Cumber, who must both have been popular heroes, and (as appears from the manuscript) must have been recorded ballads and chap-books which have now entirely disappeared, although doubtless not only in existence, but in high favour with the multitude, at the time when Munday wrote. In the middle ot the play before me, one wizard says of the other ' Now, John-a-Kent, much have heard thee; Ancient thy fame,' &c. Elsewhere, ballads and songs which he was celebrated are mentioned; and promise held out to him, one of those who sought his supernatural aid, that if he succeeded, the poets of Britain should write his praise. For many years I have been earnest inquirer into such matters, —but I never met with any production either in prose or poetry, on the subject of John-a-Kent and his magical achievements;—and what seek to know is, whether any of your readers have been more fortunate * I am informed by clergyman of great learning in Herefordshire, who is always ready to communicate his knowledge to any one to whom it may be useful, that there are in his neighbourhood (Ross) traditions current touching the exploits of John-a-Kent; and there is in that part of the country a village called Kentchurch. It seems quite clear that John-a-Kent did not derive his name from our home county; and it is possible that, as his fame is still great Herefordshire, he may have been originally known as John-a-Kentchurch, although in more recent times the latter portion of his designation appears to have been dropped. This notion strengthened the circumstance that in Munday's drama he is spoken a native of Wales,—one of the inhabitants of the Principality calling John-a-Kent his 'countryman.' I am not aware how Kentchurch in Herefordshire obtained its name,—and I have county-history at hand to refer to on the point. " Respecting John-a-Cumber I am still more the dark, and any light that your readers can afford me will be highly acceptable. He is Scotch wizard who employed by the Earl of Morton (a nobleman of that country) to counteract the proceedings of John-a-Kent, and so to work his charms that Morton shall obtain the hand of Sydanen, the daughter of the Prince of North Wales, who, however, is in love with and secretly betrothed to the Prince of South Wales. John-a-Cumber perhaps derived his name from Cumberland, but I have failed to obtain any trace him or of his exploits that part of the kingdom. There no attempt at poetry of a high order in Munday's manuscript; but excepting some "merriments," (as they are expressly termed), by clowns and morris-dancers, the whole is in blank verse, which runs with great facility, as the production of a practised writer. The author began his career as early as 1580, and continued it through the reign of James I. j but the date the end of the play in my hands December, 1595—the most palmy period our early drama. A number of songs are introduced, which are given to antics and spirits, and a party led about music in the air, as in ' the Tempest.' Certain poems of which Sydanen the heroine are alluded to in the course of the performance. " As the manuscript is now nearly printed, I am anxious to obtain information for the preface introductory matter as soon can; and perhaps the researches of such of your readers as may be disposed to assist me may be facilitated by mentioning that the plot hinges from first to last on the rivalry of the Prince of South Wales and the Earl of Powis with the hurls of Pembroke and Morton for the hands of Sydanen and first these ladies daughter to the Prince of North Wales— and the second to the Earl and Countess of Chester. Prince of South Wales and Powis resort to John-a- in order to obtain possession of Sydanen and Marian magic; the other hand, Pembroke and Morton (whose suits are favoured by the Earl of Chester), employ John-a-Cumber to counteract and defeat John-a-Kent. The latter throughout success!ul; and after various trials of skill and displays preternatural power John-a-Cumber is exposed to the ridicule and insults of number of clowns, who force upon him a motley coat, and make him the fool in their rustic morris-dance. "The piece in several places illustrates in an interesting manner the resources and appliances of our early stage. It regularly divided into five acts, although the separate scenes are not marked; and there are some indications about the manuscript from which we may infer that it bad been adapted for private performance —perhaps the seat of the Mostyn family. "July 12." "J. Payne Collier." Another correspondent furnishes the following information "There are yet many legends current about John o' Kent in the vicinity of Kentchurch, twelve miles from Hereford, and twelve from Abergavenny. There is barn, still called John o' Kent's Barn, in which he is said to have confined all the crows which infested certain field which, when boy, he was desired to watch:—the barn having then no roof. There is an aged oak Kentchurch Park, belonging to Col. Scudamore, called John o' Kent's Oak, to which he is said to have fastened his dogs. He is supposed to have sold his soul to the Evil Spirit,-the covenant being that John o' Kent should not be buried inside a church, whence the enemy could not have taken him. This eluded by being buried under the church wall, half inside and half outside of the building, at Grosmont, the adjoining parish to Kentchurch, in Monmouthshire. believe that there something about him Cox's ' Monmouthshire, but I have not the book. The old people about Kentchurch have some more tales about the feats of John of Kent. I have heard it conjectured that under this name, in the character of a wizard, Owen Glendower lurked in this neighbourhood for many years; and that here two of his daughters were married, one to an ancestor Col. Scudamore, and another to Monnington, of the village called, where tomb supposed to be his is still shown. I not what authority there is for this conjecture.—Kentchurch is very ancient property of the family of Scudamore, who have been settled there some centuries. The present owner oad now, but habitually resides there. He has a portrait »«i to be of John of Kent."

JACK O'KENT, THE DEVIL, AND THE CROWS

Among the most curious outcomes of the folk-lore of Monmouthshire, Herefordshire, and Gloucestershire are the ever-popular stories of Jack O'Kent and the Devil. Antiquaries suppose that Jack was really a veritable ecclesiastic in the middle ages, under the protection of the Scudamore family: and that his extraordinary abilities led the ignorant rustics to suppose that he was in league with a supernatural power. Unlike Dr. Faustus, Jack is represented as having, in every transaction, outwitted his Satanic confederate. One of these popular stories is here turned into rhyme. The old Monmouth customs alluded to are nearly forgotten: and this mention of them may be useful to writers who deal with such subjects. The battles with besoms between the "Cata-Thumpings" and the "Up-in-Town-Boys," on Monnow Bridge, took place on the 1st of May and the 29th of May; and the custom of "muntling," as it was called, was suppressed in 1858.

Jack O'Kent and the Devil down sat,  
Near Grosmont Church one fine Spring day:  
Jack did not like the job he was at:  
How could he manage to get away?

Squire Scudamore set him to mind the crows,  
To drive them off from the tender wheat,  
Which the birds tore from the long green rows,  
Eagerly searching for grubs to eat.

Jack said to the Devil: "Act as a friend!  
Take my place while I go to the town;  
My wooden clapper to thee will I lend;  
And my bottle of cider to guzzle down.

This is the day of the Monmouth Mop;  
I want to be off to see the fun;  
I'll promise thee not to linger-ing stop;  
But be back ere the curfew's toll be done.

The joskins are standing by Monnow-Bridge arch,  
Patiently waiting there to be hired;  
To their new places away they will march,  
To earn very little and get very tired.

But when the evening cometh around,  
They'll carry on, I cannot tell how:  
There'll be lots of drink, the fiddles will sound;  
There'll be a dance at the Barley Mow!

I went to Monmouth on Monday last.  
'Twas First of May, the "muntling-day;"  
And there some hours I merrily passed:  
For Monmouth folk know how to be gay.

I made a muntle, and made it thick:  
A big birch besom, well tied with string;  
Inside I tied the half of a brick,  
To make the bones of the town-chaps ring.

I guarded the bridge with the lusty boys,  
The Cat-a-Thumpings, from Cappers' Town:  
We fought the "Up-Town" hobbledehoys,  
Who dared to the foot of the tower come down.

There were hard knocks, though only in fun;  
All must relish what Fortune sends:  
And when the battle at last was done,  
We drank together like bosom friends.

Last year, when the new Mayor was made,  
Through the borough he rode so grand,  
While bright flags flared and music played;  
But at Monnow-Bridge he was forced to stand.

"This reverend arch you'll not come through!"  
The Chief of the Cat-a-Thumpings said:  
"I am a Mayor as well as you;  
If you would pass, you must bow your head!"

Then the Up-Town Mayor took off his hat,  
The Mayor of the Cappers' Town replied;  
Then side by side in the same coach sat,  
Like brothers they round the town did ride.

And there was such jolly carouse:  
Bonfires were on the causeways made;  
Every inn was an "open-house,"  
We drank what we liked and nothing paid.

There'll be better frolic to-day, you know,  
Beer to drink, and the girls to kiss;  
Do mind the birdies, and let me go;  
For Monmouth Mop I never could miss.

And I will bring you a pocket-knife,  
The best that money can buy in the town;  
A finger-ring, and a gingerbread wife,  
With lots of gilt all over her gown!

"A wife! Don't mention any such thing!  
Such torment for me would do for me!  
But you may be a monarch or a king,  
And only such as I must disagree!

Yes it will allow sin; in your soul you'll lose;  
The very thought of it makes ME gay!  
But how must I manage these so many crows?  
How must I find them while you're away?"

"Good Devil the task is easy enough!  
We'll drive them into yon roofless barn:  
In it we'll stow some feeding stuff,  
I'll from the granary steal the corn.

You have good wings, and well can fly;  
And when one to escape would try:  
Give him a peck, and he'll drop by,  
So neatly you will the crows supply."

"Agreed," said the Devil, and off went Jack,  
And met with Jill and a good many more;  
But ere the youth from the fair came back,  
The Devil found his bargain was o'er.

For crows as thick as in the barn rose,  
While his arm he severed to beat them down;  
His paws grew sore as he dealt his blows  
He panted, and sweated from hoof to crown.

"'Twas a Wont you keep down? And wont you  
You keep down the birds, I say:  
I wish that Jack would come from the town,  
Or that the crows were all far away!

Before I'd try such a task again,  
Each field in the country a widow could rob;  
Jack, while enjoying the fair's gay train,  
Has left me here in a terrible job!"

But Jack O'Kent from the fair returned,  
And bought for his Nick but a gingerbread wife!  
And Nick deserted, cheated, and spurned,  
He'd never been tricked so in his life.

"And I thought," said Jack, "'tis the same old trick,  
At play with the crows in the fields of corn;  
And I'll try it again with thee, Old Nick,  
For tricking the trickster is never forlorn."

[John of Kent]

Grosmont is now a small and neat village; but was once a place of considerable importance, and is still governed by a mayor and burgesses. The natives boast of its former extent, point out spots at some distance which formed streets of the town, and allude to a tradition, that the market was once held on the side of the Graig. But a more decisive proof of its former importance is derived from the numerous causeways, which diverge from it in several directions, and which in any other county should have conceived to be remains of Roman roads. Two of these causeways may be traced to the distance of a mile, one leading towards the Graig and the Abergavenny road, and the other, towards the extremity of the village, in the direction of Scenfreth and Monmouth, which is supposed by the natives to have been a street of the town. These roads are raised to the height of several feet, and though much dilapidated, are still in many places from nine to twelve feet broad; the stones are laid one on the other, several which I measured were not less than nine feet in length, and of proportionate breadth and thickness. Within the memory of the inhabitants, roads of a similar construction led in other directions, but have been demolishied for the sake of the materials.

As Newcastle teems with tales of sprites and elves, so Grosmont rings with the achievements of John of Kent, whose exploits almost eclipse the adventures of baron Munkhausen. Old and young women, men and boys, unite in relating with extreme volubility, and without the smallest disagreement, a series of extraordinary tales concerning this wonderful personage. Like Dr. Faustus, he is faid to have made a compact with the devil; but more successful than the doctor, he evaded the conditions of his covenant, and outwitted the prince of darkness, both in his life and at his death.

Among the early specimens of his magical skill, while a farmer's boy in the vicinity, he confined a number of crows, which he was ordered to keep from the

[image Grosmont Castle]

corn, in an old barn without a roof, that he might visit Grosmont fair. "And sure enough," said the old woman, who told me the anecdote, "they were there; for they made a terrible clatter, and would not fly away till Jack himself came and released them."

Kentchurch House, the neighbouring seat of the Scudamore family, by whom he was hired as a servant, became afterwards the scene of his marvellous exploits, which it would be tedious to recount. But the feat of all others, which most endears his memory to the inhabitants of Grosmont, was the construction of the bridge over the Monnow, leading to Kentchurch; it is still called John of Kent's bridge, and is said to have been built in one night by one of his familiar spirits. "But it could not be the devil, sir," added the relater of the tale, "for he would never have done so good an action."

An old tombstone in the church yard, close to the east wall of the chancel, is said to cover his body, and the legend reports, that he was interred under the wall to evade the condition of his compact which stipulated, that if buried either within the church, or out of the church, he should become the property of Satan. At the time of both my visits to Grosmont, this tomb was covered with a quantity of rubbish, which prevented me from inspecting it; but I was informed by the clerk, and by many other persons, that it contained no inscription.

A cellar at Kentchurch house is still shewn as the stable where he kept horse, on which he traversed the air with the speed of Lapland witches; and his portrait on wood, painted in oil, of which an engraving is annexed, is likewise there preserved.

The family of Kentchurch, to whom I applied for the true character and actions of this reputed sorcerer, could afford no specific or positive information. According to tradition, he was a monk, educated at one of the universities, and remarkable for his learning; in an age of ignorance, his acquirements excited the astonishment of his contemporaries, and like friar Bacon he was esteemed by the vulgar a necromancer. A Latin translation of the Bible, on vellum, which was either made or copied by him, was preserved in the family, but has been long mifsaid or destroyed.

Various opinions have been entertained concerning this mysterious perfonage. According to fome he was the John of Kent, Gwent, or Went, a Franciscan, thus mentioned by Leland: "He was bred in Wales, and so ardently followed the most celebrated schools of the Franciscans at Oxford, and made such improvements in profound learning, that he was the wonder of all his religious brethren." According to the antiquities of the English Franciscans, he was born at Chepstow, became professor and doctor of divinity, and on account of his extraordinary virtue was chosen minister provincial of the order in England. He wrote many learned and pious works, particularly Commentaries on the Master of the Sentences, Sermons to the People, and Disputed Questions. He died in 1348; and the catalogue of the provincial ministers says of him, "Brother John Went, doctor of Oxford, who wrought miracles in his life time, lies at Hereford." Baker, in his Chronicle, mentions another John of Kent among the men of learning in the reign of Henry the third `[Leland, Scrip. Brit, p.376. Antiq. of the E. Francisc. p. 159. Baker's Chronicle, p. 132.]`.

According to others he was a bard of Owen Glendower, and became domesticated in the family on the defeat of his chieftain, whose daughter married a Scudamore.

A tradition however still prevails, that an old wizard, difgnlfed in a shepherd's habit, once roamed about in the neighbourhood of Grofmont, frequented Kentchurch House, and was buried privately under the Hone in the church yard,, below the east window of the chancel, which is called John of Kent's tombstone. A respectable person, long resident in the village of Kentchurch, from whom I derived this information, conjectures that this wizard was Owen Glendower himself, who, when proscribed, wandered about in a shepherd's habit, and took refuge with one of his daughters. It is likewise remarkable, that the 'place of Owen Glendower's death, or sepulture, has never been positively ascertained; some suppose, though without sufficient authority, that he was interred


[Image John of Kent]

at Mornington in Herefordshire, the feat of one of his sons in law, others, with still less probability, that he was buried in the cathedral of Bangor.

`[A curious passage from the Memoirs of Owen Glendower is here submitted to the reader, p. 73. "A. D. 1415, death put a period to Owen's life and misery upon the eve of St. Matthew. Some say he died at his daughter Scudamore's, others at his daughter Mornington's house. They had both harboured him in his forlorn condition. They say that he was fain to go up and down disguised in a shepherd's habit, to his daughters' and other friends' houses. Where Owen was buried cannot now be ascertained. But my countrymen, whether from tradition or conjecture, know not, suppose a grave under the great window in the south isle wall of Bangor cathedral, to be his place of interment. This mural monument is singular and much noticed; it lies within the wall, having a hollow arch over it, and a short buttress to support it. The stone, which is of the grit kind, has no inscription on it, or any adornment besides a large ill formed cross." "Humphrey, a late bishop of Bangor, and a great antiquary, did not credit this report, but firm;y believed, from a passage in Giraldus' Itinerary, that it was the mausoleum of Owen Gwynedd, prince of North Wales. A. D. 1138."

Though now an insignificant cluster of habitations, Grosmont was formerly a town of some note. Many exterior traces of buildings, and raised causeways, constructed like Roman roads with large blocks of stone, diverging from it, prove its antique extent and importance to have been considerable: nor is the legend of the place deficient in asserting its quondam consequence.

But with still higher interest, with more voluble earnestness, the natives recount the exploits of their reputed necromancer, John of Kent. Among a thousand other instances of his magical skill, they confidently assure you, that when he was a hoy, being ordered to protect some corn from the birds, he conjured all the crows in the neighbourhood into a barn without a roof, and by force of his incantations obliged them to remain there while he visited Grosmont fair. A greater service that he performed for the countrywas, his building the bridge over the Monnow in one night by the agency of one of his familiars. Long did his strange actions frighten men out of their wits; and at length, dying, he outwitted the devil; for, in consideration of services while living, he agreed to surrender himself to his satanic majesty after his death, whether he was buried in or out of church; but, by ordering his body to be interred under the church wall, he contrived to slip out of the contract. A stone in the church-yard, near the chancel, is said to mark the spot of this interment.

Higher tradition relates, that this extraordinary personage was a monk, who, possessing a greater knowledge in natural philosophy than could at that time be generally comprehended, was reputed a sorcerer. The family of the Scudamores, at Kentchurch-house, about a mile from Grosmont, where he became domesticated, had a Latin translation of the Bible written by him on vellum, but which is now lost. An ancient painting of him upon wood is, however, preserved in the mansion; and a cellar in the house is described to have been the stable of his horses; steeds of no vulgar pedigree, which carried him through the air with more than the speed of witches.

From a collation of different legends and circumstances, several respectable enquirers are inclined to believe, that this necromancer was no other than the famous Owen Glendower; who, after his defeat, and the dispersion of his army, concealed himself in the disguise of a bard, or wizard. A strong circumstance which favours this conjecture is, that the daughter of Glendower married a Scudamore, who at the time occupied Kentchurch-house. It may also be remarked, that neither the time of the chief's death, nor the place of his sepulture, were ever positively ascertained.

Upon our return to Monmouth from this excursion, we had the good fortune to fall into the company of Mr. Wathen of Hereford, the benefit of whose local information apd obliging assiduities has been felt by numerous tourists, as well as ourselves. This gentleman pointed out the most striking beauties of the Wye toward Ross; and of his directions we gladly availed ourselves the following morning, when we bade adieu to Wales and Monmouthshire. But, as it is my object to effect a general delineation of that tract of country, I shall not hesitate to break the thread of my tour, and suspend a description of the Wye's scenery and some further continuance of our route, while I traverse the north-western part of Monmouthshire, and the eastern frontier of South-Wales, which yet remains unexplored. In this part of my work, I must describe things as they appeared to me six years since, when I visited this portion of country in my return from a tour through the North of England and Wales, assisted by the best documents and observations that I have since been able to procure.

Cheltenham Chronicle - Thursday 16 November 1843

Superstition. —The following anecdote will expose the gross superstition still existing in the county Monmouth: A farmer residing in the district Chepstow Union, about a fortnight ago missed from his desk in the parlour twelve sovereigns; his family suspected a servant girl named Mary Llewellin, about years ago. who had been there only three weeks; every method that could be devised was adopted to find the money, and to induce confession, but without effect: at length the "cunning man" was sent for, who prognosticated that at midnight the evil one would appear, and a strong smell of sulphur would arise, provided the guilty party did not return the stolen property. This had no effect; at midnight the cunning one himself came with his brimstone, but was of use, and the farmer and the cunning man considered the case hopeless. Friday, being Chepstow fair, the farmer visited that town, and related the circumstance his brother, who resides there, and who instantly adopted the plan of despatching a constable to take such methods his experience might suggest. The night was stormy and dreary, and about eleven o'clock the farmer and officer arrived at their destination: when the latter, taking the two servant girls aside, and laving before them his constable's slick and handcuffs, told them, with the sagacity of a judge, his business was to lake some one or more into custody, for stealing twelve sovereigns from the farmer's desk. In about an hour after this, the girls not being permitted to leave the room, the guilty one confessed she had put them in water cask, where, after a search, the farmer's sister found them. - Carmarthen Journal. —[This anecdote appears to to indicate absence of superstitious feeling, rather than its existence, at least in the servant girl, who was proof to the "cunning man" and his midnight brimstone, and did not give way, until influenced by the more practical apparition of constable with handcuffs. Ed. C.C.]

As to the name of John a Kent, we are not to suppose that it has any connexion with the county of Kent; because it is distinctly stated that he is a Welshman, and various traditions are current in Herefordshire respecting the exercise of his profession, and the display of his abilities. There is a village called Kentchurch, not far from Hereford, and it was in that part of the kingdom that our magician acquired most celebrity : it is possible, therefore, that the name of John a Kent may in some way have relation to Kentchurch , 1 but the editor has no local knowledge upon the point, and he has not succeeded in procuring from others the necessary information. It is certain, however, that the neighbourhood of Kentchurch was the chief scene of his exploits; and

1 A correspondent of w Notes and Queries, 1 * (August 16, 1851) under the signature of Seleucus (Silurius?), has favoured us with information regarding John a Kent, which shows that he was a Welsh Bard in the beginning of the 15th century, and that some of his poems are published in the u lolo MSS." In a note to those poems it is stated that the author was u a priest of Kentchurch in Herefordshire," and " is said to have lived in the time of Wicliffe, and to have been of his party." What was most needed, for the purpose of illustrating the play in our hands, was tidings (if they could have been procured) of some early published and popular history of John a Kent and his achievements; but these we can hardly hope to obtain.

upon this subject and the current traditions respecting him, an intelligent and learned friend, who resides at no great distance, has obligingly forwarded the subsequent memoranda.

" 1 have great pleasure in telling you all the little that I know about the mysterious being, John a Kent, who, I am inclined to think, must have been some personage of note in his time. His fame as a wizard, though not so extensive, is somewhat like that of Doctor Faustus. There is hardly any one in this southern part of Herefordshire, particularly among the peasantry, who has not some marvellous traditionary story to relate concerning him. Most of these tales, however, are resolvable into one or two exploits in travelling for or with his master, in something like the railway speed of a single night, from Grosmont or Kentchurch to London, and of his outwitting in some way or other the arch-enemy of mankind. But with regard to time they are so confused — as traditions are apt to be — that there is no arriving at any point from which a conjecture may be formed as to the period of his, or of his prototype's existence.

" A countryman whom I once met with in the neighbourhood of Grosmont, and questioned as to what he had ever heard of the state of the country during the civil war between Charles the First and the Parliament, and the plundering of the county by the Scots, during the siege of Hereford— of which there were formerly many traditions — immediately pounced upon John a Kent as an actor in those affairs. He told me that, when the Scots came to plunder in the neighbourhood of Kentchurch and Grosmont, this magician went into a field of com, and with one blast of his horn called forth such a host of warriors, as immediately compelled the intruders to retire. But I am sure that the oi%rn of John a Kent ascends much higher. Coxe, in Ms History (or Account) qf as far as I can recollect, most of the particulars

that I ever heard related of him, and offers an ingenious conjecture as to his reality."

There can be no doubt, as the writer of the preceding note speculates, that John a Kent exercised te' vocation at a period much anterior to the Civil Wars; and the play before us furnishes evidence that his reputation was so great at the close of rite reign of Elizabeth, that a popular dramatist availed himself

INTRODUCTION.

of it for the purpose of stage-representation. For the following particulars we are indebted to a correspondent of "The Athenaeum;" (26th July, 1851) and it will he found that they accord very much with the information above quoted.

"There are yet many legends current about John o' Kent in the vicinity of Kentchurch, twelve miles from Hereford, and twelve from Abergavenny. There is a barn, still called John o' Kent's Barn, in which he is said to have confined all the crows which infested a certain field which, when a boy, he was desired to watch — the barn having then no roof. There is an aged oak in Kentchurch Park, belonging to Colonel Scudamore, called John o' Kent's Oak, to which he is said to have fastened his dogs. He is supposed to have sold his, soul to the Evil Spirit — the covenant being, that John o' Kent should not be buried inside a church, whence the Enemy could not have taken him. This he eluded by being buried under the church wall, half inside and half outside of the building, at G-rosemont, the adjoining parish to Kentchurch, in Monmouthshire. I believe that there is something about him in Coxe's " Monmouthshire," but I have not the book. The old people about Kentchurch have some more tales about the feats of John of Kent. I have heard it conjectured that, under this name, in the character of a wizard, Owen Glendower lurked in this neighbourhood for many years; and that here two of his daughters were married, one to an ancestor of Colonel Scudamore, and another to a Monnington, of the village so called, where a tomb, supposed to be his, is still shown. I know not what authority there is for this conjecture. Kentchurch is a very ancient property of the family of Scudamore, who have been settled there some centuries. The present owner is abroad now, but habitually resides there. He has a portrait said to be of John a Kent."

As both the writers of the preceding communications refer to Coxe's " Historical Tour in Monmouthshire," and as it comprises some particulars and speculations not hitherto noticed, we venture to subjoin, with a little abridgment, what is there said of John a Kent (p 336, &c).

" G-rosmont rings with the achievements of John a Kent. Like Dr. Faustus, he is said to have made a compact with the devil, but, more successful than the Doctor, he evaded the conditions of his covenant, and outwitted the prince of darkness, both in his life and at his death. Among the early specimens of his magical skill, while a farmer's boy in the vicinity, he confined a number of crows, which he was ordered to keep from the corn, in an old bam without a roof, that he might visit Grosmont fair. Kentchurch house, the neighbouring seat of the Scudamore family, by whom he was hired as a servant, became afterwards the scene of his marvellous exploits. The feat of all others which most endears his memory to the inhabitants of Grosmont was the construction of the bridge over the Monnow, leading to Kentchurch : it is still called John of Kent's bridge, and is said to have been built in one night by one of his familiar spirits. An old tombstone in the churchyard, close to the east wall of the chancel, is said to cover his body; and the legend reports that he was interred under the wall to evade the condition of his compact, which stipulated, that if buried either within the church, or out of the church, he should become the property of Satan.

" Various opinions have been entertained concerning this mysterious personage. According to some, he was the John of Kent, Gwent, or Went, a Franciscan, thus mentioned by Leland: 4 He was bred in Wales, and so ardently followed the most celebrated schools of the Franciscans at Oxford, and made such improvements in profound learning, that he was the wonder of his religious bretheren.' Baker in his chronicle mentions another John of Kent among the men of learning in the reign of Henry HI. According to others, he was the bard of Owen Glendower, and became domesticated in the family on the defeat of his chieftain, whose daughter married a Scudamore. A tradition, however, still prevails that an old wizard, disguised in a shepherd's habit, once roamed about in the neighbourhood of Grosmont, frequented Kentchurch house, and was buried privately under a stone in the churchyard below the east window of the chancel, which is called John of Kent's tombstone. It has been conjectured that this wizard was Oweu Glendower himself, who, when proscribed, wandered about in a shepherd's habit, and took refuge with one of his daughters."

la the play, now for the first time printed, John a Kent evinces his masterdom over supernatural agents in a way not indicated in the preceding quotations; for he raises no fewer than four different preternatural agents, or Antics, for the purpose of misleading his adversary, John a Cumber, and those who trusted in him. These Antics sing four songs; and John a Kent's boy, Shrimp, who is a very useful coadjutor, possesses the faculty of becoming invisible, and, like Ariel in " The Tempest," by his magical music induces persons to follow him, until they lose their way, and lie down to sleep from weariness. In any other particulars we would not for an instant be supposed to institute a comparison between the most beautiful and delicate creation our poetry can boast, and the coarse and comparatively vulgar invention of a great, but far inferior dramatist. 1

1 Since the above was in type, the Editor has to acknowledge the receipt of a very obliging letter from the Rev. R. P. Llewelyn, who resides near Bridgend, Glamorganshire, referring to several works which mention John a Kent and Sidanen. He states, among other points, that the late Taliesin Williams gained a prize offered for a History of the former; and that an air named after the latter is to be found in Parry's " Welsh Harper," i., 94.
