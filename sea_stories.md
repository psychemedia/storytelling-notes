# Sea Stories

One obvious one (?!) is [*The Fisherman and his Wife*](https://www.worldoftales.com/European_folktales/German_folktale_9.html#gsc.tab=0) ([other examples](https://sites.pitt.edu/~dash/type0555.html)) which is widely found across many traditions. Another is *Why the sea is salt*, ([examples](https://sites.pitt.edu/~dash/type0565.html)).

Scottish legends (esp. Scottish islands) of *selkies*, which is to say, *seals*, shedding their seal skin and taking human form. A typical telling is of woman being captured then lost, eg [Faroe Islands, "Kópakonan (Seal Woman)"](https://old.visitfaroeislands.com/en/be-inspired/in-depth-articles/legend-of-kopakonan-(seal-woman)/). The tale type is [*The Mermaid Wife*](https://sites.pitt.edu/~dash/type4080.html) (that link gives several examples). See also various seal and mermaid related stories in [George Douglas, *Scottish fairy and folk tales*, 1900, p186-196](https://archive.org/details/scottishfairyfol00doug/page/186/mode/2up?q=seal). For a collection of Scottish collections, see [here](https://sites.pitt.edu/~dash/scotland.html).

Also related water sprites (*kelpies*) eg [*Folk-Lore Journal*, 1889: Vol 7, p199-201](https://archive.org/details/sim_folk-lore-journal_1889_7/page/198/mode/2up?q=kelpie). See also this [overview](https://www.ancient-origins.net/myths-legends/riding-seas-kelpies-and-other-fascinating-water-horses-myth-and-legend-006170).

A Duncan Williamson tale of [*Jack trying to catch a mermaid*](https://www.tobarandualchais.co.uk/track/32158?l=en). Another of his tales, [*Death in a Nut*](https://www.tobarandualchais.co.uk/track/36459?l=en), also involves the sea-shore.

A story in which the sea plays an interesting role, from Sabine Baring-Gould, *Old English Fairy Tales*, 1895, p141+, is [*The Undutiful Daughter*](https://archive.org/details/oldenglishfairyt00bari/page/140/mode/2up). *I keep looking for an opportunity to tell this one!* See also https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonnie_Annie and http://www.springthyme.co.uk/ballads/balladtexts/24_BonnieAnnie.html

Collections of tales relating to smuggling will often have a strong nautical theme.

There may be something of interest buried in the following:

- [*Legends and superstitions of the sea and of sailors*, Fletcher Bassett, 1895](https://archive.org/details/legendssuperstit00bass)
- [*Sea fables explained*, Henry Lee, 1883](https://archive.org/details/seafablesexplain00leeh_0/)

I was surprised not to immediately find stories about white horses either running into the sea and becoming waves, or turning from waves into white horses.

I have a couple of loosely Island-related sea stories: sinking of the *Eurydice*, and the founding of the Pepperport ([*Walter de Godeton and the Shipwrecked Wine*](https://github.com/psychemedia/stuff-and-nonsense/blob/master/03_Storytelling/walter_de_godeton_and_the_shipwrecked_wine.md)).

Hampshire Chronicle - Monday 16 May 1803

The impress on Saturday, both above and below Bridge, was the hottest that has been for some time—the boats belonging the ships at Deptford were particularly active, and it is supposed they obtained upwards of two hundred men, who were regulated on board the Enterprizcetill late at night, and sent in the different tenders to the Nore, to be put on board such ships whose crews are not completed.

The impressed men, for whom there was not room on board the Enterprize on Saturday were put into the Tower, and the gates shut, to prevent any of them effecting their escape.

The impress on the River was Sunday continued with the utmost activity.

On Saturday, about two o'clock, a dreadful affray happened at Hungerford-stairs, in consequence of a man of war's boat, in which were a midshipman and a gang of seamen, impressing some watermen at that place. Having pressed several they put ashore to take another, when the wife of the last pressed man clung to her husband, and not being able to separate them, she was conveyed away with him in the boat; some coal heavers returning at this moment to work, immediately assailed the boat with glass bottles, and coals from the lighters, till most of the people within her were desperately wounded, and amongst the others, the unfortunate woman: the midshipman and three of his crew were beaten into the water and the whole had probably perished, had not a barge come at this moment belonging to one of the Insurance Offices, to demand the release of a pressed man belonging to that Office, then in the boat: recovering their man, and finding the situation of the press-gang, they took the boat in tow, and proceeded towards Blackfriar's-bridge : to this place the mob pursued her, and being joined by additional numbers, they insisted upon sinking the boat with her crew but this was successfully resisted by the Master of the Insurance barge, who sailed with them below London-bridge, and put them singly on board their tender. The poor woman is said to have died of her wounds. Three of the gang were taken to an hospital with very little hopes of recovery.

Hampshire Chronicle - Monday 21 November 1803
The following are the particulars of a very extraordinary outrage committed by a press gang at Margate, on Tuesday se'nnight as related by the parties who were the sufferers:— About ten o'clock at night, Mr. Lancells, who is grocer and tallow chandler, was going round his premises with a lantern, as was his usual custom, to see every part was safe from the danger of fire, when he heard a voice exclaim, "Who is that fellow with the lantern ? Mr. Lancells replied, "Who calls me that fellow ?" The Captain instantly ordered his men to seize and take him to the boat. Mr. Lancells informed him that he was a constable, and commanded the Captain in the King's name to keep the peace, and added that he was a tradetman, a housekeeper and in all those capacities exempted from the Impress Act. The only answer was, "D——n his eyes, take him on board." He was then dragged from his own door in the Market-place to the Pier, where he was overtaken Mr. Gore, the High Constable, who is also Captain of the Volunteers. Mr. Gore interposed his authority, with his staff of office in his hand, upon which the Captain ordered his gang to seize Mr. Gore, which was done accordingly, and he was dragged into the boat after Mr. Lancells, where they were detained near two hours in the rain under a guard of sailors, while the pressgang proceeded round the town, and pressed several other persons as little liable to the impress as Mr. Gore or Mr. Lancells. Among the persons impressed was Mr. Brett, the farmer, North Down, near Margate. The Civil Power was at an end; the officers of the law being impressed, Mr. Brett had no one to apply to for protection, bur was obliged to submit to the same violence the other gentlemen had suffered. They were all taken on board the Texel, where Mr. Gore happening to know the pilot, received some civilities. The Captain of the Texel was bed, it being three o'clock in the morning when they reached the ship : but Captain Byng was no sooner informed what had happened, than he invited Mr. Gore and Mr. Lancells to breakfast, and made them every apology for the outrage that had been committed, expressing the deepest concern for their sufferings, and informed that his boat should take them on shore whenever they pleased to depart from the ship. They were accordingly landed at Margate on the evening of the day after they had been impressed.

Hampshire Chronicle - Monday 05 June 1815

About six o'clock on Wednesday evening, as the Officers of the Impress at Hull were attempting to take a seaman, by great exertion he extricated himself from their hold ; during the struggle a mob had collected together, and the press-gang were annoyed for a considerable time by them. After this, the mob assailed the house of rendezvous, the sign of the Spurn Lights, South-end; not satisfied with breaking all the windows and doors, and pulling down part of the front wall, they proceeded into the house, and destroyed all the furniture, linen, glass, &c. the beds they tore open, and strewed the feathers the street; the liquors and ale they drank or carried away pitchers.
