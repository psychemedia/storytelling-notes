# Sea Stories

One obvious one (?!) is [*The Fisherman and his Wife*](https://www.worldoftales.com/European_folktales/German_folktale_9.html#gsc.tab=0) ([other examples](https://sites.pitt.edu/~dash/type0555.html)) which is widely found across many traditions. Another is *Why the sea is salt*, ([examples](https://sites.pitt.edu/~dash/type0565.html)).

Scottish legends (esp. Scottish islands) of *selkies*, which is to say, *seals*, shedding their seal skin and taking human form. A typical telling is of woman being captured then lost, eg [Faroe Islands, "KÃ³pakonan (Seal Woman)"](https://old.visitfaroeislands.com/en/be-inspired/in-depth-articles/legend-of-kopakonan-(seal-woman)/). The tale type is [*The Mermaid Wife*](https://sites.pitt.edu/~dash/type4080.html) (that link gives several examples). See also various seal and mermaid related stories in [George Douglas, *Scottish fairy and folk tales*, 1900, p186-196](https://archive.org/details/scottishfairyfol00doug/page/186/mode/2up?q=seal). For a collection of Scottish collections, see [here](https://sites.pitt.edu/~dash/scotland.html).

Also related water sprites (*kelpies*) eg [*Folk-Lore Journal*, 1889: Vol 7, p199-201](https://archive.org/details/sim_folk-lore-journal_1889_7/page/198/mode/2up?q=kelpie). See also this [overview](https://www.ancient-origins.net/myths-legends/riding-seas-kelpies-and-other-fascinating-water-horses-myth-and-legend-006170).

A Duncan Williamson tale of [*Jack trying to catch a mermaid*](https://www.tobarandualchais.co.uk/track/32158?l=en). Another of his tales, [*Death in a Nut*](https://www.tobarandualchais.co.uk/track/36459?l=en), also involves the sea-shore.

A story in which the sea plays an interesting role, from Sabine Baring-Gould, *Old English Fairy Tales*, 1895, p141+, is [*The Undutiful Daughter*](https://archive.org/details/oldenglishfairyt00bari/page/140/mode/2up). *I keep looking for an opportunity to tell this one!*

Collections of tales relating to smuggling will often have a strong nautical theme.

There may be something of interest buried in the following:

- [*Legends and superstitions of the sea and of sailors*, Fletcher Bassett, 1895](https://archive.org/details/legendssuperstit00bass)
- [*Sea fables explained*, Henry Lee, 1883](https://archive.org/details/seafablesexplain00leeh_0/)

I was surprised not to immediately find stories about white horses either running into the sea and becoming waves, or turning from waves into white horses.

I have a couple of loosely related sea stories: sinking of the *Eurydice*, and the founding of the Pepperport ([*Walter de Godeton and the Shipwrecked Wine*](https://github.com/psychemedia/stuff-and-nonsense/blob/master/03_Storytelling/walter_de_godeton_and_the_shipwrecked_wine.md)).
