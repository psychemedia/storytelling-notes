SKETCH OF THE TALE OF BRAN.

Bran, the son of Llyr, with his brothers, and the attendants of his court, are described as sitting on a large stone at Harlech `The vicinity of Harlech abounds in Druidical remains: At the ebb of the tide part of a great stone wall, four-and-twenty feet in thickness, may be seen, extending into the sea for about two-and-twenty miles in a serpentine manner, from the coast of Merionethshire, midway between Harlech and Barmouth. This extraordinary work is called Sam Badrig, or St. Patrick's Causeway. Sarn Badrhwyg, or the Ship Breaking Causeway, remarks Pennant, it ought to be more properly called, from the numbers of ships lost on it. Its principal city is supposed to have been Caer Wyddno, or Gwyddno's City. Gwyddno flourished from about the year 460 to 520. He was surnamed Garanhir, and was father to Elphin, the patron of Taliesin the bard. At the end of Sarn Badrig are sixteen large stones, one of which is four yards in breadth. Sarn y Bwlch runs from a point N. W. of Harlech, and is supposed to meet the end of this. It appears at low water near the mouth of the Dysynni. The space between these formed, several centuries ago, a habitable hundred of Merionethshire, called Cantref Gwaelod, the lowland hundred. There appears little reason to doubt that these Sarns, or Causeways, were the work of art; according to monkish legends, Sarn Badrig was miraculously formed by St. Patrick, to expedite his passage to Ireland. That this part of the sea was formerly dry land seems to be well attested both by written and oral tradition. The catastrophe of its being deluged is recorded in a very old MS., written between the ninth and twelfth centuries, called the Black Book of Caermarthen (preserved in the Hengwrt collection), page 53. The inundation is believed to have happened about the year 500, owing to the negligence of a drunkard named Seithennin, who left the slucies of the embankment open. Vide Welsh Archaiologia, vol. ii. p. 64.`, when they perceive thirteen ships steering towards them from the south of Ireland. They go down to the strand, and the ships offer tokens of peace. The Irish king, Maltholwc, is on board one of these ships; and he says, that he has made the voyage for the purpose of obtaining the hand of Bronwen `[Bronwen means white bosom. In Jones's Relics of the Bards, p. 124, it is stated that the highest turret of Harlech Castle is called Bronwen's Tower.]`, Llyr's daughter, and so create a union between the two islands. Bran invites him on shore, and Maltholwc lands. The next morning a council is held, when the Irish king's request is complied with, and he is married to Bronwen.

Bran's half brother Evnisien (the man of strife) becomes angry at not being consulted respecting this marriage, and, as an insult to Maltholwc, mutilates his horses by cutting off their ears and their lips close to the teeth. Intelligence of the insult is conveyed to Maltholwc, who immediately orders his ships to prepare for departure. Bran demands the reason of his so doing, and expresses his regret at the insult which has been offered to him by Evnisien: he at length proposes not only to replace the horses, but also to give Maltholwc a bar of silver equal in compass and height to himself, and a plate of gold as large as his face. On these terms the matter is made up, and a banquet of reconciliation takes place.

At this feast the appearance of Maltholwc is pensive, instead of his usual gay manner. Bran makes a farther apology, and offers him, as an additional remuneration, a magic cauldron, into which any man who may be slain to-day shall, if thrown, be on the morrow as well as ever; but he shall not have the use of speech `[Taliesin more than once, in his mysterious verses, speaks of magic cauldrons. In his poem of Preiddeu Annwn^ the spoils of Annwn (translated the deep ?),Welsh Archaiol. p. 45, he styles it the cauldron of the ruler of the deep, which first began to be warmed by the breast of nine damsels (the Gwillion). He describes it as having a ridge of pearls round the border: "Neu pair pen Annwfn! Pwy y vynud? Gwrym am ei oror a mererid." "Is not this the cauldron of the ruler of the deep? What is its quality, with the ridge of pearls round its border?" &c.]`. The horses are given the next day, and in the evening there is another banquet, at which Maltholwc inquires of Bran where he had obtained this wonderful cauldron. Bran replies, that he believes it came from Ireland, and expresses his wonder that Maltholwc should be ignorant of its history. Maltholwc thus reminded, says, that he remembers something of it; for that, as he was one day hunting on a mountain above a lake in Erin, called the Lake of the Cauldron, he saw a hideous, gigantic, tawny man come out of the lake with a cauldron on his back, followed by a woman who was twice his size, being large with child. That he took them home with him; but they were of so mischievous a nature, and so riotous, that, to get rid of them, he had recourse to the plan of forming an iron house, in which he induced them to live; and having made them drunk, he had caused coals to be piled about it and blown into an ardent glow. The heat becoming white, and inconvenient to the inmates, the gigantic man put his shoulder to the side of the iron house, and forced it out; his wife followed him, and they escaped from Ireland over to Wales.

Bran then says, that he received them kindly; in gratitude they gave him the cauldron, and afterwards became excellent warriors.

After this conversation, Maltholwc and his thirteen ships depart for Ireland, taking with him his wife Bronwen. They are received with great joy in Ireland; and a son is born, who is named Gwern ab Maltholwc, and who is put out upon fosterage. The Irish, however, on learning the insult which had been offered to their king in Wales, become indignant. To mark their anger, they cut off all communication with that country, and insist on Maltholwc's putting away his wife Bronwen, and making her perform all menial offices. Bronwen, thus disgraced, rears a starling, whom she teaches to speak; and having completed her tuition of the bird, ties a letter under its wings, with which it flies over to Wales. The bird at length contrives to discover Bran, "the blessed," `[Bran was the father of Caradawg (Caractacus), and according to the Triads, he with all his family were carried to Rome, and remained there seven years as hostages for the son. Bran having met there with some Christians, and being converted, he prevailed on two Christians to accompany him to Britain, by which means the faith was introduced. Hence was the epithet "blessed" given to him.]` alights on his shoulder, ruffles its wings, and discovers the letter. Bran immediately assembles his forces; a temporary government is formed, and with his host he proceeds to invade Ireland; "where there were then only two rivers called Lli and Arcan."

O'Flaherty's Ogygia, as well as Heating's History of Ireland, (which profound works may be considered of about equal historical value with the Mabinogion), record that, on the landing of Partholan, the first inhabitant of Ireland after the flood there were three lakes, and ten rivers in that island; which the old poem, beginning, ... (Adam, the reverend sire of all our race), thus enumerates ...

"Nor lake expanded, nor a rapid stream  
Found they in Ireland, on their first arrival,  
Besides three lucid lakes of obscure fame,  
And ten bright streams of ancient high renown.  
In truth-declaring verse I'll now record  
The names of these three ancient, smooth, wide lakes:  
Irrus, fair lake of soft expanded bosom;  
Loch-lurgan, and Fordreman's lake.  
The Lee, the Bois, the Barrow bright, and Erne;  
The Sligo fair, the Moarne, and the Moy;  
The Finn, the LifTy, watering Leinster's plain,  
Are the fair rivers of high ancient fame."

Both Keating and O'Flaherty mention, in the course of their history, the bursting out of various other lakes and rivers in Ireland.

Some swineherds, who were on the sea shore, discover his approach, and go with all possible speed to Maltholwc, when the following dialogue takes place:

"Sir," they said, "health to thee!"

"Heaven grant you success!" was his reply; "and have you any news?"

"Sir, we have most wonderful news," they said in answer; "we have certainly seen a wood on the sea, where we never beheld a single tree before."

"Truly, that is a strange thing," said the king; "did you see any thing besides?"

"O yes; we could perceive a great mountain by the side of the wood, sir," they replied; "and that mountain was moving, and there was a very high ridge on the mountain, with a lake on each side of the ridge. The wood, the mountain, the whole seemed in motion."

"Well," said the king, "there is no body here who knows any thing of all this unless it be Bronwen; inquire if she knows?"

Thereupon messengers repaired to Bronwen.

"Madam," said they, "what dost thou suppose those things can be?"

"The men of the Isle of the Mighty, who are coming over, from having heard of my affliction and disgrace."

"What can be the wood that was seen on the sea?" said the messengers.

"The masts of ships, and their sail-yards/' Bronwen replied.

"Mercy on us!" they cried; "but what was the mountain that was seen on one side of the ships?"

"That was Bran, my brother, coming into shallow water," she replied; "there was no ship that could contain him."

"But what could be that tremendous ridge, and the lake on each side of the ridge?"

"It is he surveying this island," said Bronwen: "he is full of wroth; his two eyes on either side of his nose, are what seem the two lakes on either side of the ridge."

The Irish warriors hold a council, and retreat over the river Llivon, breaking down all the bridges. Bran advances with his troops, but they find the river impassable.

"There is only this to be done," Bran replied, "that whosoever would be the top, let him be the bottom; I will be a bridge." And then was that saying first made use of, and still is it proverbial from that event.

Bran laid himself across the river, and hurdles being placed upon him, his troops pass over. A negotiation ensues; when Bronwen suggests, that a house should be built of sufficient size to contain Bran, who, as he never had one before large enough for him, will feel the honour so great, that he will accede to a peace.

To proceed with a more rapid analysis of the tale. Only seven return from this expedition to Ireland, after having destroyed nearly all the people of the country. Bran is mortally wounded, and orders his companions who survive to carry his head to be interred in the White Hill in London, as a protection against all future invasions, so long as the head remained there. The sequel of the tale recites their progress to London to bury the head. At Harlech, in their way, they are kept seven years listening to the birds of Rhianon, singing in the air, and in Dyved (Dimetia) by attending to the last words of Bran, they stay in a grand hall for eighty years, enjoying every kind of pleasure; all their misfortunes, and the object of their further progress being kept out of their minds: but upon opening a door looking towards Cornwall, their real condition breaks in upon their memory, and they pursue their journey.
