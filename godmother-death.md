# Godfather / Godmother Death

Godfather Death, or Godmother Death, *(Aarne-Thompson-Uther tale type 332)* tells the tale of young child, born of poor parents, who has Death for their godparent.

Death teaches the child a trick or two about how to tell whether someone who is seriously ill would survive or die. With this knowledge, the child becomes a great doctor. But the child/doctor goes against the instruction of Death, and saves two people should have otherwise died. Death is not happy. The child/doctor is shown how lives are represented and Death makes his feelings known...

## The Grimm Versions

The story of Godfather Death appears in Grimms' collection in two slightly different versions.

The following example, taken from a translation in 1853, represents the "settled" version of the tale according to the Grimm brothers.

The Godfather Death

A CERTAIN poor man had twelve children, and was obliged to work day and night to find them bread to eat; but when the thirteenth child was born, he ran out in his despair on the high road to ask the first he should meet to stand godfather to it.

Presently he met Death striding along on his withered legs, who said, "Take me for godfather." The man asked him who he was, and received for reply, "I am Death, who make all things equal." "Then," answered the man, "you are the right person — you make no difference between the rich and poor; you shall be godfather for my boy."

Death replied, "I will make your child rich and famous; he who has me for a friend can need nought." Then the man told him the christening was fixed for the following Sunday, and invited him to come; and at the right time he did appear, and acted very becomingly on the occasion.

When the boy arrived at years of discretion, the godfather came and took him away with him, and leading him into a forest showed him an herb which grew there. "Now," said Death, "you shall receive your christening gift. I make you a famous physician. Every time you are called to a sick person I will appear to you. If I stand at the head of your patient, you may speak confidently that you can restore him, and if you give him a morsel of that vegetable he will speedily get well; but if I stand at the feet of the sick he is mine, and you must say all medicine is in vain, for the best physician of the world could not cure him. Dare not, however, to use the herb against my will, for then it will go ill with you."

In a very short space of time the youth became the most renowned physician in the world. "He only wants just to see the sick person, and he knows instantly whether he will live or die," said every one to his neighbour; and so it came to pass, that from far and near people came to him, bringing him the sick, and giving him so much money that he soon became a very rich man. Once it happened that the King fell sick, and our Physician was called in to say if recovery were possible. When he came to the bedside, he saw that Death stood at the feet of the King. "Ah," thought he, "if I might this once cheat Death; he will certainly take offence; but then I am his god-child, and perhaps he will shut his eyes to it,– I will venture."

So saying he took up the sick man, and turned him round, so that Death stood at the head of the King; then he gave the King some of the herb, and he instantly rose up quite refreshed.

Soon afterwards Death, making an evil and gloomy face, came to the Physician, and pressed him on the arm, saying, "You have put my light out, but this time I will excuse you, because you are my god-child; however, do not dare to act so again, for it will cost you your life, and I shall come and take you away."

Soon after this event the daughter of the King fell into a serious illness, and, as she was his only child, he wept day and night until his eyes were almost blinded. He also caused to be made known, that whoever saved her life should receive her for a bride, and inherit his crown. When the Physician came to the bedside of the sick, he perceived Death at her feet, and he remembered the warning of his godfather; but the great beauty of the Princess, and the fortune which her husband would receive, so influenced him that he cast all other thoughts to the wind. He would not see that Death cast angry looks at him, and threatened him with his fist; but he raised up his patient, and laid her head where her feet had been. Then he gave her a portion of the wonderful herb, and soon her cheeks regained their colour, and her blood circulated freely.

When Death thus saw his kingdom a second time invaded, and his power mocked, he strode up swiftly to the side of the Physician, and said, "Now is your turn come and he struck him with his icy-cold hand so hard, that the Physician was unable to resist, and was obliged to follow Death to his underground abode. There the Physician saw thousands upon thousands of lamps burning in immeasurable rows, some, large, others small, and others yet smaller. Every moment some were extinguished, but others in the same instant blazed out, so that the flames appeared to dance up here and there in continual variation.

"Do you see?" said Death. "These are the lamps of men's lives. The larger ones belong to children, the next to those in the flower of their age, and the smallest to the aged and grey-headed. Yet some of the children and youth in the world have but the smallest lamps."

The Physician begged to be shewn his own lamp, and Death pointed to one almost expiring, saying, "There, that is thine."

"Ah, my dear godfather," exclaimed the Physician, frightened, "kindle a new one for me; for your love of me do it, that I may enjoy some years of life, marry the Princess, and come to the crown."

"I cannot," answered Death; "one lamp must be extinguished before another can be lighted."

"Then place the old one over a new lamp, that its dying fire may kindle a fresh blaze," said the Physician entreatingly.

Death made as if he would perform his wish, and prepared a large and fresh lamp; but he did it very slowly, in order to revenge himself, and the little flame died before he finished. Then the Physician sank to the earth, and fell for ever into the hands of Death!

```

The version that appears in Grimm's original 1812 edition is less elaborate, and also differs in the ending: Death shows the Doctor his lamp, and warns the Doctor not to cross him again, but the Doctor continues to live. *In one of my tellings, I used "a chill wind blew between them, and as the doctor's flame spluttered, he clutched his chest in pain. 'Do not cross me again', said Death; and with that, my story ends.". That approach also allows the flame to be blown out...*

One problem with the tale according to Grimm is the question of how the Doctor's actions save lives if the lives are associated with the lamps. What lamp is used to rekindle the lamps of the King and his daughter? Should there be a trade, somewhere, on the Doctor's life? Or perhaps other lamps should extinguished earlier than they might otherwise be, their oil used to top up the king's lamp, and his daughters, according to some sort of conservation principle? Or might lamps that would have otherwise burned be sacrificed, miscarried children of the Doctor's wife, for example?

...

In the tale as a whole, there are various elements that we can change to influence the feel of the story, or even change how it can progress.

For example, there may be some variation in the description of what we might term the *hall of lamps*. In some versions, the lamps are oil lamps of various sizes, explicitly filled with different amounts of oil representing the remaining life of each person they represent. In other tellings, they are candles of different sizes, variously burned down. For example, large, church like candles might represent a long and healthy/sturdy life; smaller, birthday cake like candles, might represent the short life of one who dies as a baby.

In both cases, we might light one lamp/candle from another, perhaps signifying giving birth, or saving someone's life, or alternatively, extending someone's own life (in which case, the flame itself represents the person's life). In the case of the oil lamp, we might imagine pouring oil from one lamp to another to represent sacrificing something of one's own life for another.

??trade oil from one lamp to another. In another, they are candles.

I quite like an ending of the form:

> *a chill wind blew between them, and the flame on the doctor's candle flickered, and spitted; the doctor clutched his chest in pain. Death gave him a withering look: "do not go against me again".*

Alternatively, the flame may be blown out, and as it does so, the doctor dies.

LXXVIII

(Google Translate from the german version)

LXXVITI. The King's Son and Death.

A mighty king sat in his kingdom; He was not lacking in goodness of all kinds and choice hearts, in worldly honor and immeasurable wealth in gold and precious stones. It was an honor for him to smack about him in his hall men who are called philosophers, i.e. highly learned sages. In this and in many other things he sought glory, for his arrogance was great. An event then occurred which filled the whole kingdom with great joy: the queen gave birth to a son. Surrounded by wealth, he grew up as befits a king's child, kind and friendly, steady and capable, manly in spirit without wrong or blunder. When he had grown old enough to think of his instruction, it happened one day, as the king was sitting at his table, that the wisest master in the hall got up and stood in front of the perch. 'Lord,' he said, 'you have a young son, whom all your friends look on with joy, for we believe he has been given to us of God to sit after you on your throne with rich honor as befits his birth. Therefore I offer myself with all willingness to teach him and to instruct him in the wisdom which I have gathered from books and from my own experience, that his name may be the more famous as he shall be wiser than other people.' When he said nothing, it was evident at once that the king did not take the speech so kindly as some had expected; Rather, he took on a somewhat angry expression and said: 'My dear, what can you teach our son? Your wisdom is worth no more than the antics of traveling people and children's games.' The master replied: 'If these words did not come from a king's mouth, they would undoubtedly be untrue, for my wisdom has never become the scorn of children, rather I have acquired such rich knowledge that it will be highly honorable for your son would be if he learned just as much: everyone will confirm that.' The king angrily replied: 'Depart from here; We tell you how it is to be done: either our son shall remain untutored and shall not sit at your feet, or he shall receive the teacher who can instruct him in unknown wisdom, of which you have never heard.' Again the master replied: 'if your son is a human being, then he will only have human comprehension: and when has one ever heard that one human being should not teach the other?' With that he ended his speech and returned to his seat. Now there was complete silence for a while, because the king was angry and therefore everyone was silent. — After a few days, when the king was again sitting at the table, there was a soft knock at the door and an order to let him in, and when the guards looked, there was a man outside who looked like a wise man and asked to be brought before the king. When the king had given his leave, the man went in and stood in front of the perch; he had a wide felt hat on his head, so that one could not see his face exactly, he also moved the brim just a little out of respect for the king, then saluted and said: 'Hail to you, sir!' Then he continued: 'You can see from my appearance, O Lord, that I can be counted among the wise; And having heard a word from you concerning the teaching of your son, which in your guesses seemed a little arrogant, I sought you out intending to put my wisdom at his disposal, for I hope that that, what I can teach him, according to your wishes, will be unknown to every living human being. But as I am old and quirky, I do not like to be exposed to the noise of far and wide people: therefore let a house be built for us two miles from the stat in the forest that is there, and bring enough food there that we can live off it for a whole year, because i don't want anyone to disturb us from the day we move in.' The king was very happy about this speech and had everything prepared as quickly as time permitted. We'll skip the preparations and get straight to that have moved into the house; The master sat down on the high seat, as was fitting for him, but the king's son at his feet, as humble as a child of low rank. So they sat in silence the first day, the second, and the third, and not a word was heard. And to make it short, the king's son serves the master morning and night all year round and sits silently at his feet every day. When the year is over, the day before the king's visit was to be expected, the master speaks to the king's son: 'Tomorrow, my son, we will be visited and brought before the king. He will ask about your lessons, and if you like it, you can answer that you are not allowed to say anything about your teaching, but that shows that such things have never been heard by a human ear. Your father will also ask if you want to stay with me longer: but I won't give you any advice in relation to this.' So it happened, as just said: the next day both were called to the castle and brought before the king. When he asked his son if he wanted to go to school longer, he answered in all friendliness that he would like to go back there. The two were given food for a year. We can now be brief, because the second year runs exactly the same way from beginning to end. Once again the king's son decided to remain in solitude. The third year passed in the same silence and in the same boredom, and when this was over and they were expecting to be picked up the next day, the master spoke like this: 'My dear son, for your silence, your patience and loyalty you should do this received as a reward that the masculinity and steadfastness that you have shown during three years will never be forgotten, but will be written down in the history books; Furthermore, it is fitting that the expectation in which you have sat here alone should not be disappointed, for you are well worthy of the teaching which no wise man before you has received. First of all, know

who I am. My name is Mors—that means death—and I'm not human, although it seemed so to you; and apart from our parting, which will soon take place, it shall be a sign of your wisdom that it will become widely famous and spread through all countries, so that no man will be as respected as you, for all people will long to see you, though some who desire it will not attain it. Now pay attention, my son, to what I am telling you in a few words, although I have been silent for a long time, because it will be of use to you: if it happens that a person in the state becomes ill, go to him inside, even if you are not called, for he will be the only one who does not plead with you to visit him. You will see me sitting with this sick person and with everyone else you come to, but you should pay attention to where I am sitting. When I sit near my feet, you should say how it will also happen that man will have a long and not serious illness and will rise up. If I sit at the side of man, the illness is shorter and much more serious, and yet it is followed by recovery and full health. But if I sit on my head, then death is certain, may the torment last longer or shorter. So this will be the cause of your fame, that you can predict to every human being what is to come, so that they can arrange themselves accordingly and make the appropriate decrees. But I want to teach you one more thing. If your friends fall ill, or notables whom you wish to please and whose friendship you wish, or obtain money and honor from them, then take the bird called karadius; if you see that I'm not sitting at the head end, you should carry the bird to the sick person and hold it in front of his face, because this bird has the peculiarity that it sucks up the sickness of the human being and absorbs it into his body. Then let go of the bird: it knows its nature and flies with the disease high in the air and as close to the sun as possible, and blows the disease from itself in the light of the sun, this but absorbs them and destroys them with their heat, the bird on the other hand is healthy. As a result of our meeting and conversation, it will happen that the peculiarity of this bird will become known through your words; they will be remembered and recorded with the name of the bird in the book, which people will call fisiologus. My apprenticeship is over now, dear son, and so is our first meeting, but we will meet a second time, and then you will not enjoy seeing each other again.' That's how the conversation ended. The day appeared when both were summoned before the king. The king's son presented the master with a commendable certificate in front of the whole entourage, and he received rich thanks and offers of gifts and tokens of honor from the king. But he refused everything and asked permission to say goodbye. The king's son's wisdom was not appreciated at first, but after a while it grew in such respect that everyone agreed that his equal had never been born; and one could say that all countries were on the move to seek him out and claim his wisdom, because everything that was mentioned earlier came to him at his word. He also made long journeys to examine the diseases of distinguished people, until his father died; And now, when he himself ascended the throne, he visited his friends, especially those belonging to his entourage when they fell ill, and the mighty of the country, whom he considered to be of use to the prosperity of the empire; but although he had received such a gift, he did not become haughty, but was so condescending, kind, and amiable, and so gentle and gentle toward all his subjects, as befits a king, that every child was dear to him: because that's the way to go, that one person's praise makes ten friends. So his days fade away in glory and happiness, that he himself enjoys excellent health and the realm of peace and prosperity, until he was a hundred years old, and still a sprightly man, because he was tall and strong and adept at caring for his body. Nevertheless, a violent illness overtook him, which caused great grief to his friends. She took him with her in such a way that after a short time there was hardly any rescue; and one day, as he was lying there in this state, he fainted, and when it was over he opened his eyes and saw something that did not please him: his old master had appeared with the wide felt hat and sat close to his head. The king immediately noticed that death was at the door and said: 'Master, why are you coming here so soon?' 'It must be like this, my son,' replied the latter. "I would not have thought it then," said the king, as I sat silently, a royal child, at your feet for three years, that you would do this to me, to tear me away from the fullness of happiness and royal honors, since I was I'm still fit and fit to govern.' 'It is true, my son,' replied the master, that you had to endure much; but you also received a lot in return; and now you will have to go with me anyway.' When the king saw that there was no longer any hope of delay, he said: 'I will be able to get so much from you that you will give me time to say an Our Father before we go.' The master said that this should be granted. The king said the first four verses of the prayer up to et dimitte nobis, but when he got that far he was silent. The master waited a long time, but the king remained silent. 'Why don't you pray, my son?' asked the old man. 'That's why I don't pray, my master, because I don't want to. You have nothing more to do here, because for this time we will have to separate. You granted me an Lord's Prayer, and therefore, based on your promise, I will not pray the last part of it until I have lived as long as my heart desires, and then I will voluntarily finish my prayer, without being called and pushed by you.' 'You deceived me by cunning son, replied the master, and therefore you will assert your will for this time.' He went away, but the king got better so quickly that it seemed marvelous to everyone how quickly the disease abated. He now lived in his honor for a second century, but then he was so bent with age, so collapsed and paralyzed that it seemed a burden to him to live any longer. He called all the leaders of the land, and a mighty assembly came together. The king's chair was erected and the ruler led there by his men. He now made stipulations for the whole empire, concerning the kingship and also the other estates, and gave his people good advice and fatherly admonition to fear God and to protect the rights of the country according to the old statutes of good princes. Then he lay down in broad daylight and commanded his ministers to prepare him for the last hour. When this was done with due solemnity, he related to his intimates all that had passed between him and the Master, and then said: 'Come now, my Master, and hear how I close the prayer which you once granted me, for now I'm ready.' The man appeared on the spot; then the king began: iet dimitte nobis\ and in the same moment as he said the amen after the prayer, he departed from this life and was much mourned, although he was old, and with that this story has an end.

Reinhold Köhler writes to me about this fairy tale, which was first referred to by Jon Sigurdsson in the Diplomatarium Islandicum / (Kaupm. 1857 J p. 239): 'The Icelandic Aeventyri is a very peculiar and at the same time the oldest known version of the widespread fairy tale of death, which gives a person - in most versions his godfather or godfather - the gift of giving him to every sick person see and see from his position whether the sick will die or will recover.

his godfather the promise to be able to make every sick person well. — Only in four of the parallels cited does the ruse with the Lord's Prayer used in the Icelandic fairy tale appear, namely in Hans Sachs, in the German fairy tale in Wolf's collection, in the Portuguese and the Norwegian. In them, too, the doctor asks Death, who wants to take him away, to let him pray the Lord's Prayer first, and then doesn't finish it. In the tale of the wolf he declares that he will pray to it for 50 years, and death laughingly accepts it; in Hans Sachs and in the other two fairy tales, however, death outwits the doctor after a while, so that he prays an Lord's Prayer. For Hans Sachs, when the doctor has not finished praying the Lord's Prayer for years that have begun, death takes the form of a sick person, lies down in front of the doctor's front door and asks the doctor to help him with an Lord's Prayer, which the doctor says acts innocently and falls for him. In the Portuguese fairy tale, death pretends to be dead; the doctor finds him lying on the street and prays the Lord's Prayer for his soul, whereupon death jumps up and seizes him. In the Norwegian fairy tale, one night Death hangs a large plaque with the Lord's Prayer on it over the doctor's bed, who, when he wakes up, reads the Lord's Prayer and, when he has finished reading it, dies. Then there is the Hungarian fairy tale mentioned above, which is obviously distorted. For in him death proclaimed to his father, when he bestowed on him the power to heal every sick person, at the same time that he should—one does not know why—die immediately if he said the Lord's Prayer or Amen. Years later, the godfather finds a crying child on the street who complains that his father hit him because he didn't know a word during prayer. 'Was it our father?' asks the godfather, and so one after the other all the words of the Lord's Prayer, and when he asks at last: 'Was it Amen?' the child, who was none other than death, replies: 'Yes, that was it; amen for you, godfather, amen/' And immediately the man dies. — Finally, the trick with the Lord's Prayer appears in a Syrian fairy tale: see Syrian sagas and fairy tales, collected from popular speech and translated by E. Prym and A. So ein f Göttingen 1881 ) see 299 rich young man, with whom he has fraternized, when asked that he will take his soul on his wedding night. So Her Reiche only marries after 400 years, and when the angel of death comes, he asks him to let him live until he has said the Lord's Prayer. When the request is granted, he says it
Our Father not. Only after 20 years does he forget to eat at home and say the prayer. Soon the angel of death appears and takes his soul. E. Prym refers to this in the subject index u. w. 'Todesengel' (p. 406) on Grimm, Kinder- und Hausmär- chen III, 132. There — in a variant of the fairy tale about the Spielhansel — death says to him when Hans Lustig prays an Our Father at a funeral: l So, I'll lift it up, that you say that bedden, nu most du deran."1 But nothing of the Lord's Prayer has occurred before: the fairy tale is obviously distorted. — The beginning of the Icelandic aeventyri is quite peculiar , the appearance of death as the prince's wise and teacher, the bird karadius 1 and finally the lusty king's voluntary prayer of the Lord's Prayer!

A well done Swedish version of the Icelandic aeventyri (according to my text) was provided by G. Cederschiöld in Ny sveusk tidskrift I (1882) pp. 220-226.

Godfather Death  
[November 20, 1547]

FOR his new child, a man would find  
A good godfather. To his mind  
Not any suited; but before  
His long and anxious search was o'er  
He met the Lord before his door:  
The Gracious One, when told the quest,  
Offered himself. The man thought best  
This offer quickly to refuse:  
"I must not. Lord, thy service use;  
Thou giv'st not equal gifts," he cried;  
"One rich, one poor, to one denied  
The gifts thou bring'st to all beside;  
My neighbours, friends, and all men know  
Unequal justice thou dost show."

Soon after. Death the peasant met;  
Quoth he, "My friend, dost thou seek yet  
For a godfather? Why not me?  
I offer now myself to thee."

Replied the peasant, "For the sake  
Of my dear child, thee, will I take.  
Thou hast a reputation ill;  
But thou hast power the place to fill,  
And thou dost bear an equal hand  
To rich and poor throughout the land."

To Death the sponsorship was given;  
He held the child in its baptism,  
And would his son a doctor make,  
With promise he much wealth should take;  
He made him skilful in the art  
Of healing; and, for his own part,  
Agreed that when the sick must die  
He would be seen the pillow by;  
But if trained skill the case could meet  
He would be standing by the feet:  
So where Death took his silent stand  
Became a token shrewdly planned;  
And the wise doctor thus could tell  
If his sick patient would get well.  
Unto the godson would, alone.  
The fateful messenger be shown.

A rich man in the village lay  
So ill, they feared that he must pay  
The debt of Nature. To him came  
Our doctor, who would win much fame  
By such a cure; he looked around.  
And Death, beside the feet, he found.  
"He will get well; " he instant cried;  
"I answer for him if be tried  
My remedies; and, for a fee.  
Twelve gulden shall be paid to me."  
Well grew the patient, and the name  
Of the wise doctor won much fame.  
And all employed him. When he came  
To a sick-bed the sign he sought  
Which his Godfather Death soon brought;  
Then he gave sentence. As he said.

The patient soon was well, or dead.  
This brought him wealth; and all men knew  
The word he said was always true.

But when ten years had passed away  
The doctor on a sick-bed lay;  
As, groaning there, he looked around,  
Godfather Death again he found:  
Hope, for the moment frighted, fled.  
For Death was standing by his head.

Quoth Death, "My godson, come with me;  
Thy course is run, as thou may'st see."

The doctor said, " I will not stay  
Thee long; but, ere I go away.  
Let me, I pray thee, say a prayer,  
For future welfare to prepare;  
This done, then I will gladly go."

Quoth Death, "Well, godson, be it so."

The doctor then began to pray.  
Of the Lord's prayer one word to say;  
But then he paused, nor did intend  
His prayer should ever have an end.  
Often came Death to see him there.  
And asked, " Hast thou yet done thy prayer ?

"Nay!" said the doctor, " such an end,  
I pray the Lord will never send."

At length Death made a cunning plan;  
In wasted form of a sick man  
He laid him down before the door.  
And called the doctor:  
"O, before I die, a Pater Noster tell.  
And save my wicked soul from Hell!"  
The doctor's prayer was quickly said;  
Then Death unmasked his grinning head;  
With fleshless hand he clutched him fast,  
His helpless victim now at last."  
Full six long years thou'st cheated me,"  
He cried; " I now take charge of thee;  
Thy ended prayer hath loosed my hand.  
So come at once at my command."

The doctor could no more delay 
Godfather Death; but passed away 
With his grim master, hand in hand,  
To find Death's vast and unknown land.

There is a proverb, Hans Sachs saith,  
"No human skill can baffle Death."

MORAVIAN STORIES

MORAVIA is so named from the river Morava (in German the river March), of which, and its affluents, it is the basin. It falls into the Danube a little above Presburg. In very early times Moravia appears to have been more civilized and powerful than Bohemia; but later, Bohemia became a considerable kingdom, and Moravia a dependency of, and eventually a margravate under the Bohemian crown.

The Moravian stories differ but little in character from those of Bohemia. The country, unlike Bohemia, abounds in dialects, although the literary language is the Bohemian. On the east the Moravian melts into the Silesian, or 'Water-Polish.'

No. 8, 'Godmother Death,' is an interesting variant of the Teutonic 'Godfather Death,' which is given by Grimm. The reason why Death is represented as a Godmother, rather than a Godfather, in the Moravian story, is, that Death (*Smrt*) is feminine in all Slavonic dialects. The story constructed on this basis is more graceful and fuller of incident than the Teutonic tale, in which Death is masculine.


VIII.— GODMOTHER DEATH.

THERE was a man, very poor in this world's goods, whose wife presented him with a baby boy. No one was willing to stand sponsor, because he was so very poor. The father said to himself: 'Dear Lord, I am so poor that no one is willing to be at my service in this matter; I'll take the baby, I'll go, and I'll ask the first person I meet to act as sponsor, and if I don't meet anybody, perhaps the sexton will help me.' He went and met Death, but didn't know what manner of person she was; she was a handsome woman, like any other woman. He asked her to be godmother. She didn't make any excuse, and immediately saluted him as parent of her godchild, took the baby in her arms, and carried him to church. The little lad was properly christened. When they came out of church, the child's father took the godmother to an inn, and wanted to give her a little treat as godmother. But she said to him, 'Gossip, `[The Slavonians are rich in terms, both masculine and feminine, expressing the various relationships between godparents and godchildren and their parents. We have only one form, 'gossip,' which thus has to do duty for both the godmother and the father of the godchild.]` leave this alone, and come with me to my abode.' She took him with her to her apartment, which was very handsomely furnished. Afterwards she conducted him into great vaults, and through these vaults they went right into the under-world in the dark. There tapers were burning of three sizes — small, large, and middle-sized; and those which were not yet alight were very large. The godmother said to the godchild's father: 'Look, Gossip, here I have the duration of everybody's life.' The child's father gazed thereat, found there a tiny taper close to the very ground, and asked her: 'But, Gossip, I pray you, whose is this little taper close to the ground?' She said to him: 'That is yours! When any taper whatsoever burns down, I must go for that man.' He said to her: 'Gossip, I pray you, give me somewhat additional.' She said to him: 'Gossip, I cannot do that!' Afterwards she went and lighted a large new taper for the baby boy whom they had had christened. Meanwhile, while the godmother was not looking, the child's father took for himself a large new taper, lit it, and placed it where his tiny taper was burning down.

The godmother looked round at him and said: 'Gossip, you ought not to have done that to me; but if you have given yourself additional lifetime, you have done so and possess it. Let us go hence, and we'll go to your wife.'

She took a present, and went with the child's father and the child to the mother. She arrived, and placed the boy on his mother's bed, and asked her how she was, and whether she had any pain anywhere. The mother confided her griefs to her, and the father sent for some beer, and wanted to entertain her in his cottage, as godmother, in order to gratify her and show his gratitude. They drank and feasted together. Afterwards the godmother said to her godchild's father: 'Gossip, you are so poor that no one but myself would be at your service in this matter; but never mind, you shall bear me in memory! I will go to the houses of various respectable people and make them ill, and you shall physic and cure them. I will tell you all the remedies. I possess them all, and everybody will be glad to recompense you well, only observe this: When I stand at anyone's feet, you can be of assistance to every such person; but if I stand at anybody's head, don't attempt to aid him.' It came to pass. The child's father went from patient to patient, where the godmother caused illness, and benefited every one. All at once he became a distinguished physician. A prince was dying — nay, he had breathed his last — nevertheless, they sent for the physician. He came, he began to anoint him with salves and give him his powders, and did him good. When he had restored him to health, they paid him well, without asking how much they were indebted. Again, a count was dying. They sent for the physician again. The physician came. Death was standing behind the bed at his head. The physician cried: 'It's a bad case, but we'll have a try.' He summoned the servants, and ordered them to turn the bed round with the patient's feet towards Death, and began to anoint him with salves and administer powders into his mouth, and did him good. The count paid him in return as much as he could carry away, without ever asking how much he was indebted; he was only too glad that he had restored him to health. When Death met the physician, she said to him: 'Gossip, if this occurs to you again, don't play me that trick any more. True, you have done him good, but only for a while; I must, none the less, take him off whither he is due.' The child's father went on in this way for some years; he was now very old. But at last he was wearied out, and asked Death herself to take him. Death was unable to take him, because he had given himself a long additional taper; she was obliged to wait till it burned out. One day he drove to a certain patient to restore him to health, and did so. Afterwards Death revealed herself to him, and rode with him in his carriage. She began to tickle and play with him, and tap him with a green twig under the throat; he threw himself into her lap, and went off into the last sleep. Death laid him in the carriage, and took herself off. They found the physician lying dead in his carriage, and conveyed him home. The whole town and all the villages lamented: 'That physician is much to be regretted. What a good doctor he was! He was of great assistance; there will never be his like again!' His son remained after him, but had not the same skill. The son went one day into church, and his godmother met him. She asked him: 'My dear son, how are you?' He said to her: 'Not all alike; so long as I have what my dad saved up for me, it is well with me, but after that the Lord God knows how it will be with me.' His godmother said: 'Well, my son, fear nought. I am your christening mamma; I helped your father to what he had, and will give you, too, a livelihood. You shall go to a physician as a pupil, and you shall be more skilful than he, only behave nicely.' After this she anointed him with salve over the ears, and conducted him to a physician. The physician didn't know what manner of lady it was, and what sort of son she brought him for instruction. The lady enjoined her son to behave nicely, and requested the physician to instruct him well, and bring him into a good position. Then she took leave of him and departed. The physician and the lad went together to gather herbs, and each herb cried out to the pupil what remedial virtue it had, and the pupil gathered it. The physician also gathered herbs, but knew not, with regard to any herb, what remedial virtue it possessed. The pupil's herbs were beneficial in every disease. The physician said to the pupil: 'You are cleverer than I, for I diagnose no one that comes to me; but you know herbs counter to every disease. Do you know what? Let us join partnership. I will give my doctor's diploma up to you, and will be your assistant, and am willing to be with you till death.' The lad was successful in doctoring and curing till his taper burned out in limbo.

THE CANDLES OF LIFE

THERE was once a poor man named Martin. He was so very poor that when his wife gave birth to a little boy, he could find no one who would stand godmother to the child.

"No," he told his wife, " there's no one that I've asked who is willing to hold this infant at the christening."

The poor mother wept and moaned and he tried to comfort her as best he could.

"Don't be discouraged, my dear wife. I promise you your son will be christened. I'll carry him to church myself and if I can find a godmother no other way I'll ask some woman I meet on the road."

So Martin bundled up the baby and carried him to church. On the way he met a woman whom he asked to be godmother. She took the baby in her arms at once and held it during the christening.

Now Martin supposed that she was just an ordinary woman like any other. But she wasn't. She was Death who walks about among men and takes them when their time has come.

After the christening she invited Martin home with her. She showed him through the various rooms of her house and down into great cellars. They went a long way underground through cellar after cellar to a place where thousands upon thousands of candles were burning. There were tall candles just lighted, candles burned halfway down, and little short ones nearly burned out. At one end of the place there was a heap of fresh candles that had not yet been lighted.

"These," Death said, "are the candles of all the people in the world. When a man's candle burns out, then it is time for me to go for him."
"Godmother," Martin said, pointing to a candle that was burning low, "whose may that be?"

"That, my friend, is your candle."

Martin was frightened and begged Death to lengthen his candle, but Death shook her head.

"No, my friend," she said, " I can't do that."

She reached for a fresh candle to light it for the baby just christened. While her back was turned, Martin snatched a tall candle, lighted it, and then pressed it on the stub of his own candle that was nearly burned out.
When Death turned and saw what he had done, she frowned reprovingly.
"That, my friend, was an unworthy trick. However, it has lengthened your life, for what is done is done and can't be undone."

Then she handed Martin some golden ducats as a christening present, took the baby again in her arms, and said:

"Now let us go home and give this young man back to his mother."

At the cottage she made the sick woman comfortable and talked to her about her son. Martin went out to the tavern and bought a jug of ale. Then he spread the table with food, the best he could afford, and Godmother Death sat down on the bench and they ate and drank together.

"Martin," she said to him at last, "you are very poor and I must do something for you. I tell you what I'll do: I'll make you into a great physician. I will spread sickness in the world and you will cure it. Your fame will go abroad and people will send for you and pay you handsomely. This is how we'll work together: when you hear of a person taken sick, go to his house and offer to cure him. I will be there invisible to every one but you. If I stand at the foot of the sick man's bed, you will know that he's going to get well. So then you can prescribe salves and medicines, and when he recovers he'll think you have cured him. But if I stand at the head of the sick man's bed, you will know that he has to die. In that case you must look grave and say that he is beyond help. When he dies people will say how wise you were to know beforehand."

She gave him further instructions and then, after bidding her godchild and its mother a kind farewell, she left.

Time went by and Martin's fame as a great physician spread far and wide. Wherever Godmother Death caused sickness, there Martin went and made mar- velous cures. Dukes and princes heard of him and sent for him. When he rubbed them with salve or gave them a dose or two of bitter medicine and they recovered, they felt so grateful to him that they gave him anything he asked and often more than he asked.

He always remembered Death's warning not to treat a sick man if she stood at his head. Once, however, he disobeyed. He was called to prescribe to a duke of enormous wealth. When he entered the room he saw Death standing at the duke's head.

"Can you cure him? " they asked Martin.

"I can't promise," Martin said, " but I'll do what I can."

He had the servants turn the duke's bed around until the foot instead of the head was in front of Death. The duke recovered and rewarded Martin richly.

But Death when next she met Martin reproved him:

"My friend, don't try that trick on me again. Besides, it is not a real cure. The duke's time has come; he must go to his appointed place; and it is my duty to conduct him thither. You think you have saved him from me and he thinks so, but you are both mistaken. All you have given him is a moment's respite."

The years went by and Martin grew old. His hair whitened and his muscles stiffened. The infirmities of age came upon him and life was no longer a joy.

"Dear Godmother Death," he cried, " I am old and tired! Take me!"
But Death shook her head.

"No, my friend, I can't take you yet. You lengthened the candle of your life and now you must wait until it burns down."

At last one day as he was riding home after visiting a sick man, Death climbed into the carriage with him. She talked with him of old times and they laughed together. Then jokingly she brushed his chin with a green branch. Instantly Martin's eyes grew heavy. His head slipped lower and lower and soon he fell asleep on Death's lap.

"He's dead," the people said, when they looked in the carriage. "The famous Doctor Martin is dead! Oh, what a great and good man he was! Alas, who can take his place!"

He was buried with great pomp and all the world mourned his death.
His son, whose name was Josef, was a stupid fellow. One day as he was going to church, his godmother met him.

"Well, Josef," she asked, "how are you getting on?"

"Oh, pretty well, thank you. I can live along for a while on what my father saved. When that's gone, I don't know what I'll do."

"Tut! Tut! "said Death. " That's no way to talk. If you only knew it, I'm your godmother who held you at your christening. I helped your father to wealth and fame and now I'll help you. I tell you what I'll do: I'll apprentice you to a successful doctor and I'll see to it that soon you'll know more than he knows."

Death rubbed some salve over Josef's ears and led him to a doctor. " I wish you to take this youth as an apprentice," she said. " He's a likely lad and will do you credit. Teach him all you know."

The doctor accepted Josef as an apprentice and when he went out into the fields to gather herbs and simples, he took the youth with him.

Now the magic salve with which Godmother Death had anointed Josef enabled him to hear and understand the whisperings of the herbs. Each one as he picked it, whispered to him its secret properties.

"I cure a fever," one whispered.

"And I a rash."

"And I a boil."

The doctor was amazed at his apprentice's knowledge of herbs.

"You know them better than I do," he said. " You never make a mistake. It is I should be apprentice, not you. Let us go into partnership. I will work under you and together we will make wonderful cures."

And so, owing to his godmother's gift, Josef became a great physician of whom it was said that there was no illness for which he could not find a remedial herb.

He lived long and happily until at last his candle burned down and Death, his kind godmother, took him.

(iii) We have the authority of our President, Mr. Mansel Pleydell, for saying that it was sometimes the practice in his own neighbourhood of Whatcombe, near Blandford, for those in attendance on the dying person to observe which way the planks of the floor lay, and if they happened to be cross-ways with the bed they turned the person round so that he would " go with the boards."

(iv.) In West Dorset it is believed that the same difficulty will be experienced if the bed upon which a dying person is lyinghappens to be placed directly under a beam. So recently as the summer of 1891 an old woman lay dying in the parish of Symondsbury, near Bridport, and, being longer in dying than was expected, several of the neighbours noticed that her bed was under a beam, and requested that the bed should be moved or " her 'ill die so hard." I am bound to say, though in this instance, thst although the bedstead was moved accordingly the poor old soul lingered on for some time afterwards.

1812 no. 44' from min [i.e. i. probably Minchen Schwertzel] Oct. 20, 1811', from Hesse. But here the oral story ends with Death showing the doctor the cave with the lights of life and warning him. In the 2nd edition (1819) is Death's cunning, with which he punishes his godchild, from the extensive adaptation of the fairy tale in F. G. Schillings 'Neuen Abendgenoa
3, 145—286 (1811. All writings 60, 9) added 1 ). Here, too, it is not the baptized who becomes a doctor, but the father; out of greed he turns the prince, for whose healing he is promised great riches, to turn around. To avenge himself for having been tricked, Death leads his godfather into the cave where thousands of lights are burning, and also shows him the light of his life, which is a small stub. The godfather is afraid, he asks death to kindle a new light for him; he refuses at first and then lets the burning stub fall down, and with that the godfather falls dead too.

The fairy tale about which R. Köhler (Gering, Islendzk Aeventyri 2, 149. 1883), Gustav Meyer (Essays und Studien 1, 242. 1885), J. Bolte (Zs. f. Volkskunde 4, 35. 1894) and G Polivka (Narodopisn^ Sbornik öeskoslovansk^ 10, 188. 1904) can be traced back to the Middle Ages; but the acquisition of death as godfather and his outwitting by the doctor originally appear separately. — In the Icelandic fairy tale 'The King's Son and Death', which was probably written by Bishop Jon Halldörsson, who died in 1339 (Gering, Islendzk Aeventyri 2, 143 nr. 78. Cederschiöld, Sv. landsmälen 5, 6, 58), an unknown master promises to teach the king's son secret wisdom that no living person has heard of. For three years the boy sat in humility and silence in the lonely forest house at the feet of the silent master; then he reveals his name Mors to him and bids him go to all the sick; there he would see his master either sitting next to the patient's feet or on the side or on the head, and from this he could tell whether the illness was long and not severe, shorter and severe but not life-threatening, or finally fatal; in the first two cases he could also hold the bird Karadius 2 ) in front of the sick person's face so that he could take away the illness

and carry them near the sun, which they destroy. The king's son now gained great fame as a doctor, ascended the throne after his father's death and lived to be a hundred years old. One day he fainted, and when he woke up he saw his old master sitting at his head. When he heard that his end was near, he asked death for a period of time before he had prayed an Our Father, but said only the first four prayers and then declared that he would not end the prayer until he had had enough. Death tricked had to forsake him, and the king lived another hundred years, until life seemed a burden to him. Then he called his superiors to admonish them, lay down on the bed, summoned his master and finished saying the Lord's Prayer, and as soon as he said Amen, he passed away.

In Germany, around 1300, Hugo von Trimberg tells a story in Kenner (v. 23711-23769 ed. Ehrismann = print from J. 1549 Bl. 118 a) as an introduction to another fairy tale (our nr. 177), how a man meets a stranger, who sleeps with him becomes godfather to his newborn child. After the baptism he hears that the stranger is Death, asks him for a long life and also receives the assurance that he will send him several messengers before he takes him away. In the 'Historia von Sancto' (Zs. f. dtsch. Philologie 32, 349), written around 1670, the same introduction occurs, but connected with the tailor in heaven (no. 36), Hans Pfriem (no. 178) and the gambling Hansel (no. 82).

Combined with the outwitting of death by the doctor, this introduction first appears in 1547 by Hans Sachs in a proverbial poem and a master song 'Der Bauer mit dem Tod' (Fabeln und Schwanke ed. Goetze 1, 290 no. 99 and 4, 315 no .448). When the farmer is looking for a godfather for his child, he encounters God and death; He doesn't want to share that one because he distributes money and property so unequally; but death is right for him because it promises to make him a doctor. After the baptism is celebrated, Death teaches his godfather that if he sees him by the head of the sick, then he must die, but if he stands at his feet, then may he recover. After ten years, during which the farmer has earned a lot of money with his cures, Death himself asks him to go away with him, but allows him to pray one more "Our Father". When the clever farmer refuses to finish the prayer to speak, death finally throws himself in the form of a
Sick down in front of his house and begs the doctor to speak a paternoster over him. Carelessly he fulfills the request, and death wrings his neck.

Jacob Ayrer (fl605. Dramen ed. Keller 4, 2467) made a pastoral play 'The Farmer with his Gevatter Death' from this poem. First Jesus offers himself to the father of the baptism, Claus Gerngast, but he is not accepted by him because he makes one rich and the other poor. The devil then approaches, whom he also rejects because he is running away from the name of the Lord and the Holy Cross (just like St. Christopher when he is looking for a master). The devil finally sends death down his neck, which treats all people equally; he is godfather and promises to make him a doctor, from which he will receive a bounty of reward (p. 2480, 2i):

'With all the sick you find me,  
And you don't see me with him  
Then you shall see me alone.  
When I stand by your sick feet,  
So he will have to die 1 );  
Then don't assume you are!

But you see me staring at the beheading, etc. For the appearance of the medicine, he should only give two apple seeds put in bread. The peasant succeeds, but in the end death fetches his godfather himself, without the latter attempting a ruse. — From Ayrer, Heinrich W o 1 f f at Nuremberg created his master song 'Der Gevatter Tod' (Zs. f. Volkskunde 4, 39). The story 'of the little farmer and death' printed by Birlinger (Take me with 1871 p. 271) from the 3rd part of the 'Biblical picture banquet' (1691) also agrees with this up to the end, where the farmer sells a rich merchant to the snatches from standing death by having the bed turned over, and in return receives only a warning from the godfather. — Moscherosch, on the other hand (Gesichte Philanders von Sittewald 2, 671 ed. Straßb. 1643 — p. 306 ed. Bobertag 1883, in 'Soldatenleben') is silent about Jesus and from

*) So vice versa as in the Icelandic fairy tale and in Hans Sachs, in J. Pratorius and in most of the newer variants (Gering 2, 150); only in Ayrer, Wolff, in the Bilderbanquefc, Aurbacher, Grimm, Bechstein, Ktihnau 1, 624, Armana pronvencau, Lnzel 1, 335 does the position of death in the feet indicate the fatal course of the disease.

devil as from medical activity; here death only promises his godfather not to fetch him until he has said the Lord's Prayer. J. C. Ettner, Des faithful Eckhart's unworthy Doctor 1697, p. 190 alludes to the doctor whose godfather was death -1, 40); not the father, but the newborn child, who played no role in the versions mentioned so far, receives the doctorate; the devil and the Lord appear at the beginning, but the ending is missing.

To quickly characterize the more recent records, we name the main motifs: A 1 . A poor man asks death to be his godfather, whom he declares to be more just than God and the devil. — B1. He or his son receives the gift of seeing death standing at the head or foot of the bed and then determining the course of the disease. — C 1 . The doctor cheats death by pausing in the last Lord's Prayer 1 ) or C2 by turning the bed. — D1 . Death takes revenge by getting him to finish the prayer or by D2 extinguishing his life light, which he shows him in the cave of lights.

A son was born to a poor man, but the man was so poor that he could find no one who would be his godfather; he went from door to door, but in vain. Now he sat down on the Heerstrasse in the hope that a passer-by might want to be moved. Soon a beautiful and splendidly dressed woman came along the way. The poor man spoke to her, and she agreed to serve him. 'Tell me your name' , said the man, 'because, miserable as I am, I cannot take you as my godmother until I know who you are'. She opened her veil, which was embroidered with gold stars, and said: 'I am the Blessed Virgin'. 'Then I don't need you,' the man replied, 'your son is unjust and doesn't treat everyone the same way; otherwise I would not be so poor and unhappy.' The Blessed Virgin passed by, and soon another woman came, tall and thin, wrapped in a black veil. The poor man approached her and she promised to be a godmother. 'But who are you?' said the man, 'for even if I am despised and miserable, I cannot take you if you do not belong among the righteous.' 'I am Death,' answered the figure, throwing back the black veil and showing him the dry bones. 'You are welcome,' said the poor man, 'because you are fair to everyone and treat everyone equally.

Come and hold my son over holy baptism!' 'Death did it and said to the man: 'When your son grows up, make him a doctor! If he is called to a sick person, I will come too; if I stand at the patient's head, it is a sign that he must die; when I stand at the foot of the bed, it is sure proof that the patient will not die yet; your son should judge accordingly. 1 — So it happened, the boy went to the doctor, and when he saw his godfather standing by the pillow, he said it was too late, the sick man could no longer be saved, and left. If the godfather stood by, he would prescribe whatever came to his mind and the patient would be cured. He was famous far and wide and acquired money and honors as much as he wanted. One day he was called to a very rich man; he found death on the pillow and announced his death to the man. The rich man turned over in bed, whining, and begged and wept; he promised the doctor his entire fortune, his house and estates if he would rescue him, until the doctor promised to try. There were a lot of servants standing around, and he made them turn the bed over as quickly as possible so that death was now at their feet. Death lifted the index finger of his hand and disappeared, and the rich man gave the doctor whatever he wanted in money and goods. It went on like this for a long time, when the doctor was called to an old man and as soon as he entered he saw death standing on the sick man's head, declared that it was too late, and wanted to go out the door. Then the old man's daughter threw herself down in front of the door and raised her hands towards the doctor, begging him so fervently. The doctor looked into her beautiful blue eyes and his heart trembled, but he didn't want to insult death again. The beautiful child begged more and more touchingly, the old man promised him his daughter if he saved him, and the doctor couldn't do it any other way, he had to dare again, he let the bed snow! turn around. Death raised his index finger again and said; 'Be careful of the third time? — The doctor married the beautiful daughter and lived happily ever after and determined not to cheat on death any more. Then the king summoned him; He found the sick man weak and Death standing on his head, and the servants weeping and wailing around him. He declared the king must die; they asked him in vain to try his cure, he was inexorable. Then the dying king got up and ordered his guards to cut off the doctor's head as soon as he closed his eyes. He was held and he saw a man in armor with a drawn sword ready to behead him. He was horrified and saw that his death was inevitable, and decided it would be better to try his godfather again, had the bed turned. (Here the story ended; the woman knew that

Praetorius already pointed out the echo of the Upper German dote (ahd. toto, mhd, tote. Fischer, Schwab. Wtb. 2, 290) = godfather to death; but our fairy tale did not grow out of a play on words, since the quantity of the vowels separates both words exactly and only an ablaut relationship would have to unite them again (J. Grimm, Mythol. 6 p. 814). In both the Roman and Slavic versions, Death is of the female gender (mort, emrt) and appears as the godmother. — The lights to which life is tied are reminiscent of Nornagest (Grimm, Mythol. * p. 380. 386. 812. 3, 256), of the Holstein legend of the countess who became a slave to the devil (Müllenhoff nr. 248) and the still common expression 'blow out the light of life, the candle of life'; Meleager's life is also tied to a burning log in the Greek legend; See Wackernagel, Das Lebenslicht (Zs. f. dtech. Alt. 6, 280). In the Lüneburg Heath, two candles are lit in front of the wedding couple and it is believed that the part whose light goes out first dies earlier (Zs. f. Volksk. 7, 40. 15, 438. 18, 311). Perhaps Lucian's story (Vera historia
1:29) from the lights that walk about in Lychnopolis instead of the people. The cave with the lights of life still appears in the Alsatian fairy tale of the talking skull (Stöbers Alsatia 1858-61, 264 =» Söbillot, C. des provinces p. 227) and in the Tyrolean fairy tale of the girl with the dead godmother (Zingerle, Sitten und Opinions a 1871 p. 160).
We repeatedly notice the influence of other fairy tale circles, especially the spirit in the glass (n. 99) and the devil Belfagor fleeing from the evil woman, from which Benfev (Pantechatantra 1, 524.
2, 551) and G. Meyer (Essays 1, 263) all too quickly concluded that they were related

38. Der Tod als Pate.

Es war einmal ein armer Mann, der hatte sehr viele Kinder und konnte sie kaum ernähren, denn sein Handwerf ging gar schlecht und wenn er auch arbeiten wollte, so bekam er doch keine Arbeit.

TO DO OCR USING CHATGPT ON p. 94


ich Dir aus der Verlegenheit helfen und Pate sein. Geh nur und lasse den Popen zur Taufe rufen, aber sage keinen Menschen, wer der Pate sein wird. Wenn die Leute versammelt sind, werde ich schon kommen."

Der arme Mann ging nach Hause und bestellte die Taufe. Als der Pope angekommen war und die Leute sich versammelt hatten, trat ein schön gekleideter Herr in die Stube, und ließ sich vom Popen als Paten annehmen. Als das Kind getauft war und die Leute sich entfernt hatten, sprach der Tod — denn er war als schöngekleideter Herr erschienen —: „Als Patengeschenk will ich Dir Folgendes mitteilen: Dein Sohn, mein Pate, soll Arzt werden. Wenn er zu Kranken gerufen wird, so soll er allein sehen können, wo ich stehe. Stehe ich bei den Füßen des Kranken, so bleibt er am Leben; stehe ich aber beim Kopfe, so muß er sterben. Durch dies Geheimnis wird er reich und angesehen werden." Darauf entfernte sich der Tod. Der Vater und die Mutter starben gar bald und als der Sohn heranwuchs, wurde er Arzt. Wenn er zu Kranken gerufen wurde, wußte er gleich, wie es um das Leben stand, und sagte es gleich ob der Kranke am Leben bleiben oder sterben wird. Dadurch wurde er so beliebt und berühmt, daß alle Kranken nur ihn riefen und so geschah’s, daß er in kurzer Zeit ein sehr reicher Mann wurde.

Nach vielen Jahren wurde er aber auch krank, und erblickte den Tod bei seinem Kopfe stehen. Da sagte der Arzt: „Ich danke Dir, daß Du mir stets geholfen und mich zu einem reichen Mann gemacht hast. Aber das möchte ich doch gerne wissen, woher Du weißt, wann ein Mensch sterben soll?" Der Tod sagte: „Ich will es Dir gleich zeigen, woher ich es weiß, wen ich abholen soll!" Und er führte den Arzt in seine unterirdische Wohnung, dort öffnete er eine Thür und sie traten in ein unendlich großes Zimmer, wo unzählige Lampen waren, in denen Oel brannte. Da sagte der Tod: „Nun sieh! diese Lampen sind Menschenleben; wenn das Oel verbrennt ist, so komme ich zu dem betreffenden Menschen und hole ihn ab. Sieh, diese ist die Lampe Deiner Frau, die ist beinahe voll, aber Deine dort, geht bald aus!" Der Arzt sagte: „Ich möchte gerne die Lampe meines Vaters sehen!" Darauf entgegnete der Tod: „Die ist schon längst in der Kammer; doch ich will Dir gleich holen!" Als der Tod hinausging, goß der Arzt schnell in seine Lampe und in die seiner Frau aus den übrigen Lampen so viel Oel nach, daß sie voll wurden. Als der Tod zurückkehrte, bemerkte er gleich den Betrug, wurde gar zornig und warf den Arzt hinaus, der nun gesund nach Hause kam und noch lange mit seiner Frau in Glück und Zufriedenheit lebte.

On a chill autumn night a beggar woman brought a boy kicking and screaming into the world.  The beggar knew from bitter experience that a winter spent in icy gutters and crowded almshouses meant death for an infant.  She remembered all too well the blue lips and frozen digits of her firstborn, whom she had lowered into the earth.

So it was with a heavy heart that she set off into the woods, as soon as the baby was strong enough to withstand the journey.  Leaves fell about her like a flaky brown snow.  Damp loam oozed its moisture through the splits in her ragtag boots.  The forest seemed to crave the winter.  The earth had frozen prematurely underfoot.  She scrambled along what paths and animal tracks she could discern, and just as she was beginning to think that she was hopelessly lost, she emerged into a glade.

The Lord of HeavenHere the leaves looked greener and firmer.  Blossoms still lit up the branches and made the air sweet-scented.  In this one circle of trees, at least, autumn clung tenaciously to the summer.

In the centre of the glade stood a solemn young man with a face world-weary beyond his years.  His clothes shimmered like sunlight off of rippling water and he was surrounded by all manner of fabulous creatures, the species of which the beggar could not name.  The man looked up at the beggar and the baby in her arms and asked in tones of faint sadness, ‘What are you doing here, lost in the woods?’

‘I’m looking for a godfather to take and raise my son.’

This seemed to bring the first turnings of a smile to his lips.  ‘I will do it.’

‘Then tell me your name.’

‘Do you not know me?  I am the Lord of Heaven.’

Alarmed, the beggar backed away.  She gripped her baby tight.  ‘Oh no, then you’ll never do for a godfather.  For you are not just.  You let the weak and needy suffer while the strong and rich feast and dance.’  And with that she fled from the blossoming glade, and all at once the chill evening caught her breath and the woods seemed dark and full of the eerie hoots and gruff calls of hidden beasts.

After wandering lost for a while more, the beggar stumbled upon a second glade.  Here the boughs of an ancient briar parted and rose like the arms and base of a throne, and on this arboreal seat perched the most peculiar of monsters, licking rank meat from the tips of its talons.  From the twisted branches around it misshapen creatures leaned, whispering sibilant advice to the monster.

It fixed the beggar with its beady eyes.  ‘What are you doing here, lost in the woods?’The Prince of Hell

‘I’m looking for a godfather to take and raise my son.’

The monster clapped its hands in a clatter of talons.  ‘Ooh,’ it trilled, ‘I will do it.’

‘Then first tell me your name.’

‘Do you not know me?  I am the Prince of Hell.’

The beggar covered her newborn’s eyes.  ‘Oh, I know you, Mister!  And you shan’t have him, for you are not just.  You damn those who serve you just like the damned who don’t.’

And with that she fled the glade, and the forest seemed now welcoming and warm and full of gruff sounds and woodsy smells all reassuringly earthy.

After wandering lost for a while more, the beggar chanced upon a third glade.  Here, in an old deckchair, a wizened figure reclined, snoring into a book of limericks he had been reading.

A twig cracked under the beggar’s tatty boots and the stranger woke with a start.  Then he composed himself, marked his page with a bookmark fashioned from a carrion crow’s feather, and smiled.  The beggar stifled a scream, because the skin of the stranger’s face was stretched as thinly and tightly across his skull as the skin of a drum, and the fingers that poked from the sleeves of his black robe were wire thin and ivory-hued.

‘Before you ask what I’m doing,’ said the beggar, ‘lost here in the woods, I venture to say that I know who you are.’

The stranger stood up straight and tall.  His robe hung emptily from his shoulders like a curtain from a rail.

‘You’re Death,’ pronounced the beggar.

‘Correct, my dear woman.  And you are?’

‘I’m nobody.  But I hope that this boy will grow up to be somebody.  So I’m looking for a godfather to take and raise him.’

‘Then I will do it.’Godfather Death

And Godfather Death did just that, carrying the infant home to his halls.  There he raised him and taught him the secret signs that warned of his own impending visits, and among them was this one: that the boy could always tell whether or not a sick patient was doomed to die by watching for Death’s shadow at the deathbed.  If his shadow loomed at the foot of the bed, death was inescapable.  If the shadow darkened the head, death was for another day.

Armed with this and other insider knowledge, the boy grew up to be an exemplary physician.  Such was his skill that he spent his days travelling the continent, called from home to home to cure the sick or else ease the passing of the suffering.

Then one day a great emperor fell ill and summoned the physician.  He rode hell for leather to the emperor’s court, where he found him shrivelled and needy in the royal bed.  The physician turned grave-faced, for as he examined the emperor he became gradually aware of a column of shadow at the foot of the bed.  This apparition was the sign his godfather had warned him of, and it meant the emperor’s demise was imminent.

Then an idea struck him.  He called for the butler, the cook and the doorman, and together they turned the bed around one hundred and eighty degrees.  The physician took a seat and waited for his godfather to arrive.

He was not long in coming.  He materialised in a cloud of smoke, smelling of cloves and pipeweed.  The physician stood up and greeted him heartily.  ‘But, my dear godfather, there must be some mistake.  Look where you’re standing, at the foot of the bed.  By your own law this means the emperor will survive.  Why don’t you go back to your halls and enjoy a fine glass of chilled wine?’

Godfather Death stood as silent as a stone, which lies at the bottom of a well in a forgotten town.  Then, in the blink of an eye, he vanished.

The emperor spluttered and a healthy pink blushed through his cheeks.  In a week he was walking, and in a week and a half he was throwing a feast  in honour of the physician, who became the toast of the entire empire.  At the feast the physician talked and danced the night away with the emperor’s only daughter, and at the end of the night he and the princess slipped away to a quiet room at the end of a quiet corridor, and there they were very happy.

But... Godfather Death had seen through his adopted son’s deception.  And he was seething, for he would not be cheated.

The next morning before the cock crowed the physician woke to a bony grip around his wrist.  It was his godfather, whispering, ‘Because you are like a son to me I will forgive you this one insult, but if you ever try to dupe me again your life will be forfeit.’

Days passed.  Weeks, months.  The physician and the princess became engaged, and at the wedding party the physician’s godfather drank too much wine and hitched his robes up and jigged merrily with the bride.  It seemed as if all was forgiven.

A year later the princess was pregnant.  Nine months after that a baby girl squealed into the world, plump and a picture of health.  Yet after the birth the princess fell ill.  Her labour had not been straightforward.  The physician tended to his bride day and night, forgetting to eat or drink as he administered her medicines and mopped her feverish brow.  Then one night, rising from her bedside and rubbing his tired eyes, he beheld a column of shadow stretching from the foot of her bed to the ceiling.  He vomited.  His heartbeat went crazy.  He called out to the shadow.  He tried to reason with it.  But it faded and the warning had gone.

He sat with his head in his hands.  He chewed his fingernails until he drew blood.  Then abruptly he rose and called to the butler, the cook and the doorman.  Together they turned the bed one hundred and eighty degrees, and by the time the morning came the princess’s sleep was less fitful and her colour had returned.  Then Godfather Death appeared.

The physician declared, with a sweet-as-you-please performance, that this was an unexpected pleasure.  ‘How good of you, Godfather, to pay us a visit at this troubling time.  But as you can see by the evidence of your own law, my wife is destined to make the fullest of recoveries.’

Death looked down at the foot of the bed and at the bulge of the princess’s feet beneath the quilts.  ‘Yes,’ he said.  ‘I see that now.  She is going to live.  But please... spare your old godfather a quiet word outside.’

The Cave of Candles

Death wrapped a bony arm around his godson’s shoulders and together they ambled out of the door.  But to the physician’s shock it did not lead, as it had on every previous exit, to the palace corridor.  Instead he and his godfather stepped through it into a vast and freezing cavern.  Behind them the door vanished and there was only the cavern stretching as far as the eye could see.  The air was silent and still, and that suited this underworld well, for here in their billions candles burned.  Some were elegant and tall, rising from the stone floor like flaming stalagmites, others were burnt down to sputtering stumps.

‘Where are we, Godfather?’

‘We are in the Cave of Candles, where wick and tallow flicker for every human life on Earth.’

‘Some of these candles are taller than others.’

‘Some lives have shorter time to burn.’

‘And what happens when a candle, such as this one–’ here he pointed to the nearest, which had melted almost as flat as a coin, and where the flame trembled its last in a circle of shiny wax ‘–has burned so low that any second now it will snuff out.’

‘It snuffs out,’ said Godfather Death, and at that precise moment the candle’s light winked out and the physician fell down dead on the stone.

TH: there is a variant somewhere Death is merciful and the candle sof reach of them expire at the same time???

The Just Man.

Once upon a time there was a poor man which the woman had just given birth and give him a son.

He wanted his child to have a godfather righteous man, and he set out for the look for.
As he was walking, his stick in his hand, he first met a stranger, who looked like a very honest man, and who asked him:

"Where are you going, my good man?"

— Find a godfather for my new son.

- Well! Do you want me? I am at your disposal, if you please.

— Yes, but... I want a fair man.

- Well! you could not have timed better; I am your man.

"So who are you?"

"I am the good Lord.

"You just. Lord God!... No I noni Everywhere, I hear people complaining about you, on earth.

"Why so, please?"

- Why? But for a thousand and a thousand different reasons.... Some, because you sent them to this world weak, counterfeit or sickly, while others are strong and full of health, who do not do more deserved than the first; others, and very honest people, as I know more than one, because, although working continually and giving themselves a dog's pain, you always leave them poor and miserable, while their neighbors, nothings , heartless men, good-for-nothings.... No, look, you won't be the godfather of my âls; farewell 1...

And the good man continued on his way, grumbling.

A little further on he met a tall old man with a long white beard.

"Where are you going, my good man?" asked the old man.

— Looking for a godfather for my newborn son.

"I am quite willing to act as godfather to him, if you like; does that suit you?

"Yes, but I must tell you first that I want my son's godfather to be a just man."

"A just man?" Well I am, I think.

"So who are you?"

- Saint Pierre.

_- The doorman of paradise, who holds the keys?

"Yes, that very one."

- Well! so... You're not fair either.

- I am not fair, me! resumed Saint Peter with a little ill humor; and why so, please, man?

- Why? Ah! I will tell you: because, for peccadilloes at all, for your miseries, you refuse, I have been told, your door to very honest people, hard-working men like me. And why? Because, after working hard all week, they may drink a pint of cider too much on Sundays... and then, need I tell you again? You are the prince of the apostles, the head of the Church, are you not?

Saint Peter nodded his head in sign of assent.

— Well, in your church it's like everywhere else; there is nothing there except for money, and the rich still comes before the poor... No, you will not also be my son's godfather; farewell I. . .

And he went on his way, still grumbling.

He then met a character who did not look very good, that one, and who carried a large scythe over his shoulder, like a reaper going to his work.
"Where are you going, my good man?" this one also asked him.

— Finding a godfather for my newborn son»

"Do you want me as your godfather?"

"I must tell you, beforehand, that I want a just man."

"A just man!" You will never find anyone fairer than me.

— They all tell me that; but who are you?

— I am Death (i).

- Ah! yes; then, you are really just you; you have no preference for anyone, and you do your job bravely. Rich and poor, noble and villainous, king and subject, young and old, weak and strong.... you strike them all, when their time has come, content to let yourself be softened or weakened by tears, threats. , prayers or gold. Yes, you really are

(i) In Breton, personified death (ann Ankou) is masculine, and that is why our man takes her as godfather to his son, and not as godmother; it is also for the same reason that I thought I should translate by Trépas, instead of ia Mort.

fair" and you will be my son's godfather. Come with me.
And the man returned to his cottage, taking with him the godfather he wanted to give to his son.

Death was held at the baptismal font, and afterwards there was a little meal in the poor man's cottage, where you drank cider and ate white bread, out of the ordinary.

Before leaving, the godfather said to his friend:

"You are very good people, your wife and you; but you are very poor! As you have chosen me to be the godfather of your âls, I want to express my gratitude to you by revealing a secret that will make you earn a lot of money. You, friend, you are going to become a doctor now, and this is how you should behave: when you are called to a sick person, if you see me at the bedside, you can affirm that you will save him, and give him anything as a remedy, clear water, if you like; he will always survive. If, on the contrary, you see me with my scythe at the foot of the bed, there will be nothing to do, and the patient will surely die, whatever you can do to try to save him.

Here, then, is our improvised doctor, putting into practice the system of his friend Death, and predicting, always with certainty, when his patients were to recover or die. As he was never mistaken and as, moreover, the remedies did not cost him dear, since he only gave clear water to his clients, whatever the disease, he was highly sought after and became rich in not much time.

However, Death, when he had occasion to pass by, came in from time to time to see his godson and talk with his friend.

The child grew and came wonderfully, and the doctor, on the contrary, grew older and weaker every day.

One day Death said to him:

'I always come to see you when I pass by here, and you've never come to my house before; you must also come and visit me, so that I can in turn treat you and show you my home.

'I'll only go too soon,' replied the doctor, 'because I know that once you're at your house, comrade, you don't come back the way you want.

"Don't worry about that, for I won't detain you until your time has come; you know that I am the just man par excellence.

So the doctor left one night to do visit his friend. They went for a long time from Company, over hill and dale, crossing arid plains, forests, rivers, rivers and regions completely unknown to the doctor.

Finally, Death stopped in front of an old castle surrounded by high walls, in the middle of a dark forest, and said to his companion: "It is here."

They entered. The master of the gloomy manor at first entertained his guest magnificently, then, on leaving the table, he led him into an immense room where millions of candles of all sizes were burning, long, medium, short, and whose lights were more or less nourished, and shed more or less light. Our man was at first quite astonished, dazzled and dumb in front of this spectacle. Then, when he could speak:

"What do all these lights mean, friend?" he asked.

'These are the lights of life, friend.

"The lights of life?" What does that mean?

— Every human creature who lives on earth at present has his candle there, to which his life is attached.

— But there are long ones, medium ones, short ones, shiny ones, dull ones, dying ones.... Why?

— Yes, it's like the lives of men: some begin; others are in their fôrœ and all their brilliance; others are weak and vacillating; others finally are about to die out i...

"Like one (a candle) that's long and tall!"

— It is that of a child who has just been born.

— And this other, that his light is bright and beHel

"It is the product of a man in the prime of life."

"Here's one that's going to go extinct, at a loss of food." *

— It is an old man who is dying. " And mine, where is it too? I would like to see it.

"Here he is near you."

"That one?... Ali! my God, it's almost entirely consumed! It's going to go out....

"Yes, you only have three more bears to live!"

"What are you saying there?" What, only a few days!... But since I am your friend and you are master id, can't you keep my candle a little longer... for example, by taking a little the next one, which is so long, to add it to mine?...

— The next one, which is so long, is that of your ah, and if I acted as you advised me to do, I would no longer be the just man you were looking for.

"It is true," replied the doctor, withholding himself and heaving a deep sigh....

And he then returned home, put his affairs in order, called the priest of his parish and died three days later, as his friend Death had predicted.

There U^àt de Vlhmm» /«fie is not psrtictiUârs in Brittany. Like almost all old popular tales, it is found everywhere, more or less complete, more or less entertained.

Bile is titled "v" in Grimm (Contts dts enfant" li de Ja hmmsw, no. 44), under the title of Death and sm Godson^ Hessian tale. Beginning analogous to that of the Breton version. The poor successively refuse as godfather the good God and the devil, and finally accept Death. This makes her godson a great doctor. She points out to him a certain plant which cures the sick very easily when he sees her, Death, at the bedside. If, on the contrary, she stands at the foot of the bed, there is nothing to be done: the patient cannot be saved. The godson, improvised doctor, becomes rich and famous. Called to the sick king, he sees Death at the foot of the bed. So he returns the Ut of mamèw to what. Death is at the bedside, and the king is cured. The Moft, although very displeased, forgives him this time; but, having begun the tour again for the princess, also ill, she leads him into a sort of cavern, where he sees a multitude and lights, &c.
The nstcoaiine in the Breton tale

Compare two bad tales. germans the coUection 3. W. Wolf, p. 365, and from the Prœhle collection, n® 13.
Guillaume Grimm, in his remarks, quotes a German farce by Jacques Ayres (in his Opus theatricum, published after his death, in 1605), which closely resembles the Bessois tale; but the episode of lights is missing. He also mentions as an analog a little poem by Hans Sachs, from i)$3.
In a collection of Hungarian tales (Gaal Stier, n» 4), same introduction. The poor man does not want Jesus as his godfather, "because he only likes the good. » Episode 4^ lights exists. The poor man, and not his godson, becomes a doctor. This part, which seems altered, is inferior to the corresponding part of the Hessian tale.

In a Sicilian tale, collected by Miss Gonzenbach (n^ 19)» different introduction. Some time after Death was godmother (here it is not like in German and Breton, where Death being masculine , she is "godfather"), she comes to fetch the poor man and takes him to a dark vault where a multitude of lamps are burning, etc. In this tale, like in the Breton tale, the godchild does not become a doctor.

The episode of lights is also found in an Italian tale from Venetia, published by MM. Widter and Wolf, in the Jakrhuch fur romanische uni englische Literatur.

GueuUette, in his MilU and a quarter of an hour, Tartar tales, or rather pretended to be such, also has, in the quarter lxxiii*, under the title of: Adventures of a woodcutter and Death, a poor man, a woodcutter , who takes Death as the godfather of one of his newly born children, and whom he wanted to expose to the ferocious beasts, because of his misery. The godfather informs him of the medicinal virtues of certain herbs which cure a number of illnesses, and moreover, so that his judgments of life or death are always infallible, he tells him that, when he sees him at the foot of the bed of his sick, these would recover, but that nothing in the world could prevent them from dying, when he saw him at the bedside. The woodcutter, who has become a doctor, also deceives his

compiles Death, turning over the bed, when the patient is deigned to die, and he thus saves the days of the great Iskender, that is to say, of Alexander the Great.

The episode of lights is missing.

It was published in the Almanac of Provence of 1876, p. eo and following, a Provencal version of the same tale, very similar to the Breton version, except for the episode of lights, which is also missing.

We will see, in the legend of Death tt his compèrty which follows, how the improvised doctor having wanted to take advantage of the secret he possessed to make himself immortal, Death, deceived several times, ends up having his revenge (see also Celtic Rniu where the legend of L'Homnu just was first published, 3* vol., Ï878, p. 38J).

On the heavens or lights of life, see also U Filleul di la Mortj in the Tales of a drinker of hiire by Ch. Deulia (lamps in which are the wicks of each mortal, more or less bright and shining).

M. Paul Sébillot tells me that he also collected at Saint-Gist, in the gallot country or non-Breton Brittany, a tale in which a boy led by a skeleton sees a plain filled with lights of different lengths.

a. One day, he said, he waved well and ate both milk and meat; He also bought bread, 1 so that at the end of the week he brought in lumps of cheese, meats, and steamers into the city, and sold them there for good. But the little children of the flesh would not go forth. All the sheep passed by; and there was no way to finish them; so there was nowhere to take it upon yourself. And when even those fingers could not be counted, the pairs of hungry bastards, but the woman fell to him with the age of twenty-four, then there was still misery over white. No one looked at him anymore. The children screamed, who in the oven, which under the oven, in which ki Woman moaned on straw and only chased one thing, it will be when they no longer have anyone to bring it to baptism. The shepherd would have still satisfied the elected children so that they would just go to sleep, that they would eat up their throats in the morning, because there would be baptisms; but the woman, she is only a beast, and do not let God calm down!
Under him once more after all the neighbors and from mine to pray; but the faith in that evening ceased. He didn't even return home, but set out on a deserted night to call whomever he met, to call him a godfather. He walks, climbs and grains from him. It may have been around midnight, and he was still alive. All his misery floored him p »mht B z & bhl božekaf, alas ^ from which he rájoik prepares the baptism as ow \\ fefei ^ ^^ ^ Ä * oéí without those Icinotrov

Baz speaks to his back, "They didn't rush. you will go! "He will see, - and here he just smiles 1 y in the eyes of a creature tall, emaciated, meets with a white tarpaulin, as if she was not there either. i, Dear Knf God! he gasped. - "Never ask who I am who I am," the creature says; 'I am forever behind every man's back. Tell me what you bless and beg for?' 'it did not matter to anyone, only if he already had 1 heart.
"Since that's so,' 'the creature will tell you, I'll help you with D. But you see, gift for gift and for nothing no. Well, you too will call me to will. I'm going from behind the sea and for the first time in the world I stopped. I hurried here over the mountain to the city. If you carry me on your doorstep and just in front of the gate, I will help you; and that you can't think I'm hard on you. Once you lie below me, there will be nothing from our godfather."
The troubled loin raised his eyes, and here it seemed only three steps out of town. "Hey, * ^ he thought," I'd like to betah, too, if this poor thing got me (for those few steps, because I used to make cents of cheese on my shoulders. "' she was already on his back, and Jabúčka was like a pierce.

asks the old. - y? Oh, no! "He wanted to say a cut, but he barely took it out. At that moment, not even a piercing relieved him." He takes a second step, and his knees break again; as if it were nothing, "Man, am I heavy for you?"

"He barely exhausted his throat, saying" no, "but at that moment it seemed to him that he was no longer carrying anything. And he asks, "Man, am I heavy for you?" - "Yeah, my God!" The man shouts from the paint; otherwise he would not have come to admit that the faith was heavy.

He looks at the strange creature and sees it in front of him with all the deeds he had heard of her: darkly bare, instead of the eyes of a pit, as if a fist entered them, - instead of a nose only a hole in the middle of the face, teeth like wheels, only throats , bare ribs, legs like two sticks, sharp scythe in long dry hand; - and the whole skeleton that moves, the bones rattle, as if to fall apart small into a pile. - I guess it'll make every man's godfather do it

ebárs to another. And don't be afraid of me; I will fulfill what I did; just if you didn't say I was tough on you. If I showed up in the morning on a white day at the baptism of your child, don't even dream about it. I will advise you, as well as godparents, you will get children and children will be kept. Don't let a single word go as far as I can tell you. ''
"He hears, then," says death. I forgive you for his sake now, take the vegetables that grow around here, where you brought me, go straight with her to the palace and announce that you will help the king, you will see me standing at his feet. and give the green thing to the sick man over his head; This shall be thy craft: they shall deliver thee in all ways unto the sick: and in every man shall he see that thou shalt see me at my feet, and shalt see me at my feet.; but when I stand by the sick man's head, he is already mine, he is already catching up; you just become TV ^ mw ^ ^^^ - ^ eĎDaj bo, i myself.

you will get rich in a short time. You only know what, man, Protect yourself from greed; for you will perish! ^
There was a quiet morning breeze, and there was no more of a slag or a sign of death.
"God forbid, was it just a dream and really?" The man sighed. "And first it will be real; for all my body still hurts what I carried."
Poverty drove him and the whims, where he cleverly gathered the vegetables, where he bore the death - and hurried to the city, right to the king's palace. - There was a lot of people piled up, because from the evening they only cut it when the king released the soul. They all walked on their fingers, but they didn't stop a stranger from reaching the bed either. Death (the godfather stood at his feet. No one saw her, only our lord, and he rejoiced when she nodded to him to do what he was supposed to do. There was no death, and the dear king sat down and asked, and for a moment he dressed and walked like a wholesome man.
"Well, man, who do you not know where you are from," the king said to him;

The lord told the king all his misery. The king immediately preached to the chariot, poured him a carriage full of money, and said, "Come on, if you are so mad. Call your godparents, I know they're coming. He calls me for baptism too; instead, you used to be on my car. And just not killed, 'I help others as much as I do. *'
From then on, everything was different with the Dakeda lord from the wooden house in the narrow valley. He became a dental doctor, sneered in all parts of the world. Bo godfather's death (she helped him faithfully and where he was called to be treated, she only stood there at the feet of the sick. and death, and the hair of his house, his godfather neither came in unto him.
But what if a person hardens and hardens it, only if he is well guided! The former lord from the narrow valley in the city also hardened and hardened. He became rich, healing the cream of those who paid him well in advance. The Godfather laughed at that. On the one hand, she warned him in advance to protect himself from greed, for he would perish. There was no last time left, only that this would be fulfilled on him as well.

Hey, but now there was also a full bag of ducats for the one to turn death away from the king ^ He wasn't looking at the spruce, just the bag. the king reached with his feet to his godfather, but he himself jumped to the king's head now: "Slowly, he could jump from place to place before the Godfather" smrc.
It was already evening, and the healthy king kept our Miracle Physician with him to go against the night. But the greedy people burned those ducats; wanted; have them at home in the depths as soon as possible. He could not be detained * ^, he went into the house at night. f
Goes, goes, and what goes next, the bigger cloud pad4 | to the mountains. He no longer sees either in front of him or behind himself. No wonder he made a mistake and got lost, he didn't even know where. It tangled in one narrow valley and at the end to one dark hole. Fearing at night, he pulled himself into her. And here, as on the boil, stands the Godfather Death in front of him and greets him: «Welcome, ■ my godson, my dear one, welcome! I've been waiting for this palace for a long time now. Well ^ when you Ä // Just ran out! Ale nestrachuj s \ 3l tcv ^ «cvv \ m ^; aíL ^ \ ^ \

V8 (on the one hand, no one can get around me, nor could Afsf me once. But don't even worry about her not flying with me. Well, what are you afraid of!"
And here she took her hand nicely and led My bottom like a palace. There, as in a beautiful church, full of wax candles plowed the walls hanging: they are still eating while they are getting married; the others are already beating, as beautiful as possible; third, half already burned, no longer reach the flames ^ but it burns and burns silently, less; the wells spill over and overheat.
Our man sighed from the deep here. ) tora laughed and started asking the same kind: "But, godmother, what are you doing here? Why do you have so many candles?"
"Hia, my godfather, that's right. In mine

He started] and praying: ^^^ b, godmother spruce, just light at least half a candle yet. I like to enjoy these ducats. Well, until I take them home!
