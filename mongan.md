CM. The Conception of Mongan . `[Nutt and Meyer, The Voyage of Bran, Vol. I, p. 44 ff.]`

' Fiachna Lurga, the father of Mongan, was sole king of the province. He had a friend in Scotland, to wit, Aedan, the son of Gabr&n. A message went from him to Aedan. A message went from Aedan to him that he would come to his aid. He was in warfare against the Saxons. A terrible warrior was brought by them for the death of Aedan in the battle. Then Fiachna went across. He left his queen at home. While the hosts were fighting in Scotland, a noble-looking man went to his wife in his stronghold in Rathmore of Moylinny. At the time he went there were not many in the stronghold. He asked the woman to arrange a place of meeting. The woman said there were not in the world possessions or treasures, for which she would do anything to disgrace her husband's honour. He asked her whether she would do it to save her husband's life. She said that if she were to see him in danger and difficulty, she would help him with all that lay in her might. He said she should do it then, “ for thy husband is in great danger. A terrible man has been brought against him on (against) whom they cannot [prevail], and he will die by his hand. If we, I and thou, make love, thou wilt bear a son thereof. That son will be famous ; he will be Mongin. I shall go to the battle which will be fought tomorrow at the third hour, so that I shall save him, and I shall vanquish the warrior before the eyes of the men of Scotland. And I shall tell thy husband our adventures, and that it is thou that hast sent me to his help.”

It was done thus. When army was drawn up against army, the hosts saw something—a noble-looking man before the army of Aedin and Fiachna. He went towards Fiachna in particular, and told him the conversation with his wife the day before, and that he had promised to come to his help at that hour. Thereupon he went before the army towards the other, and vanquished the soldier. And the battle was routed before Aedin and Fiachna.

And Fiachna returned to his country. And the woman was pregnant and bore a son, even Mongin son of Fiachna. And he thanked his wife for what she had done for him, and she confessed all her adventures. So that this Mongan is a son of Manannan mac Lir, though he is called Mongin son of Fiachna. For when he went from her in the morning he left a quatrain with Mongin's mother, saying :
“ I go home,
The pale pure morning draws near :
Moninnin son of Ler
Is the name of him who came to thee.” '

CMD. The Conception of Mongán and Dub-Lacha's Love for Mongdn. `[Nutt and Meyer, The Voyage of Bran, I, pp. 70-84.]`

"Once upon a time Fiachna Finn went from Ireland to Lochlann, 2 where Eolgarg Mor was then king, and there he found great respect and love and honour. He had not been there long when the King of Lochlann fell ill, and his physicians told him that nothing could cure him except a red-eared shining-white cow which was to be boiled for him. This cow was found in the possession of Caillech Dub (Black Hag). She refused to give the cow except under condition that Fiachna should become security. Now this was the hour and time that messengers came for Fiachna Finn, the son of Baet£n, and he went with those messengers, and took the kingship of Ulster, and was king for one year.

One day Fiachna found the hag outside his ddn demanding her security. She told him that the King of Lochlann had not paid for the cow as arranged. Fiachna offered to pay a price on his behalf but she refused. After much bargaining, the hag said, “ if all the kine of the province of Ulster were given to me, I would not take them, until thou come thyself to make war upon the king of Lochlann.”

Then Fiachna took the nobles of Ulster to attack Lochlann. The King of Lochlann sent venomous sheep against them, and for three days three hundred of Fiachna's warriors were killed by the sheep each day. Fiachna prepared to go and fight against the sheep in spite of the protest of his men. While they were discussing the matter, they saw a tall warrior coming towards them. He wore a green cloak of one colour, and a brooch of white silver in the cloak over his breast, and a satin shirt next his white skin. A circlet of gold around his hair, and two sandals of gold under his feet. The warrior offered to keep the sheep from him if Fiachna gave him “ that ring of gold on thy finger as a token for me, when I go to Ireland to thy wife to sleep with her ... It shall be none the worse for thee ; for a glorious child shall be begotten by me there, and from thee he shall be named, even Mongin the Fair (Finn), son of Fiachna the Fair. And I shall go there in thy shape, so that thy wife shall not be defiled by it. And I am Manannan, son of Ler, and thou shalt seize the kingship of Lochlann and of the Saxons and Britons.” So it was agreed and the strange warrior went to Ireland and in the shape of Fiachna himself he slept with Fiachna's wife, and in that night she became pregnant. On that day the sheep were destroyed and Fiachna seized the kingship of Lochlann and of the Saxons and Britons. Fiachna then paid the Black Hag and returned into Ireland from Lochlann and found his wife pregnant, and, when her time came, she bore a son. When Mongan was three nights old, Manannan came for him and took him with him to bring him up in the Land of Promise, and vowed that he would not let him go back into Ireland before he were twelve years of age.'

p28-9

Fiachna Finn was King of Ireland and Manannan mac Lir was King of the Other-world or Lochlann. Manannan was in love with Fiachna's wife and this is the ruse by which he was enabled to lie with her with her husband's consent. By a trick he compelled Fiachna to make war upon him, and because he was King of the Other-world and had therefore control of all ' magic and enchantment ', Fiachna was in danger of defeat and death. When things were at their worst, he appeared before Fiachna on the battle-field as a tall warrior marvellously clad. He offered to help Fiachna to defeat his enemy, who was of course Manannan himself, for a consideration, namely that they should change forms and that Manannan should go to Ireland to Fiachna's court in Fiachna's form and sleep with Fiachna's wife. He said ' I shall go there in thy shape so that thy wife shall not be defiled by it.' So it was agreed, and Fiachna in Manannan's form was able to conquer his enemy and seize the kingship of Lochlann. At the same time Fiachna's wife became pregnant by Manannan in Fiachna's form.

Thus the child Mongan born to Fiachna's wife was the son of Manannan though he was also the son of Fiachna, because he was begotten by Manannan in Fiachna's form. Then Manannan came and stole his son Mongan when he was three nights old and took him to the Other-world where he kept him for twelve years.
