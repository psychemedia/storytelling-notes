# Steampunk Set, Ryde Steampunk Festival

`Set for the [Isle of Wight *Steampunk Festival*](https://www.iowsteampunkfestival.co.uk/), 20th-22nd September, 2024.`

In certain respects, we might imagine the Steampunk milieu to offer an alternative history of a world timeline that forked from our own in the age of steam to embrace mechanised clockwork at industrial scale and iterate at the speed with which technology advances today.

In the same way that many of the old stories, myths, and legends remained a part of the folk memory in our timeline, so too we might imagine that some of the old tales persisted in the steampunk timeline. But what stories might they have been, why might they have persisted, and how would they have been told?

Steampunk philosophy:

- community
- welcoming
- "wonder and potential mixed with fear", "mystified fascination", and age when "machines were visible, human, fallible, and above all, accessible" [TH: itself  reaction to the hidden mysteries of myth and legend?]; " Steampunk ... focuses on the positive aspects associated with the Industrial Revolution" "Steampunks hope to recapture the Victorian sense of wonder surrounding new technology", works are "optimisitic", "Steampunk worlds are warm and whimsical, and the technology in them has a sense of soul"; "these stories project a future that captures readers' imaginations rather than predictions that fill them with dread" -> so tales need to capture that sense of wonder looking back?  https://digitalcommons.calpoly.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1114&context=forum

-> in many ways, the old stories harkened back to an age before steam

Situate just past point of bifurcation, but where there is enough ambiguity, or a line of ambiguity, can be introduced in a tale from our timeline, that it is not clear which timeline we are in and for which there are perhaps alternate readings.

Is there a timeline of the steampunk alternative history / speculative history

Story where could be a nautical ship or an airship, ambiguous as to which? A magic carpet or magic shoes tale?

> It was a time when clockwork and steam were hastening mechanisation in the fields and, automation in the factories, the old stories left behind in mountainsides and the valleys where only the elderly resided now.

-> Luddism as an optimistic strategy, Steampunk a world where the Luddites won; after the hanging, the world could have gone two ways -> current, steampunk; we all know which way it went. Tracts that were optimistic calls for machinery.

In the country, the old magic still worked its way, father's watch, mother's musical box.

It might have all turned out so differently, if only they'd agreed on the time, at the time, rather than leaving it another ?? years, at a state, rather than a company, level.

Saying that something "works like clockwork" imples some sort of regularity, or repeatability. But if you need differently clocked systems to work together, and your clocks all tell a slighty different time, well, then things drift, and who knows what might happen.

- the natural pace of life (Too Much Time [5-8 mins])
- ~~struggle to retain the old ways of doing things [a Luddite Tale, [15 mins]]~~

Set:

- Too much time (6)
- There were of course, people who always had an always lived outside of regulated, clockwork time. Tinkers, for example. I came by this tale one-such fellow from a Scottish traveller, called Duncan Williamson. He had learned to tell tales to entertain the other traveller children when he himself was a child, and touched the lives of many storytellers today who we saw at festivals and gatherings during the new wave of British Storytelling in the 1990s. This tale is of a tinker, a  Lamp (12)
- Out in the valleys, of Wales, industrialisation was changing the landscape. The coal-mines of the foundries ... But out in the mountains, the old traditions lingered on. Like this tale I heard from Welsh storyteller Ceri Phillips Sin-eater (12)
>Our bus-driver on a trip up to Castell Henllys told us the story (his was set somewhere in the Swansea Valley - I set mine either in Ystalyfera or Ystradgynlais). He was an older gentleman, not our usual bus-driver, who spoke Welsh in my dialect (which stuck with me due to how rare that was to hear it outside the community or my home, even then). His version was much shorter, more of a trad campfire tale, nowhere near as gory and mainly focused on the Sin-Eater as a ghost. My telling draws on supplemental research and similar, more fleshed-out tales in the same style as well as an aesthetic nod towards American urban legends (which I love).
> Such cautionary ghost/tylwyth teg tales are very common the further up the valley you go - I think this is due to the proximity of the settlements to disused pit shafts and the left-over byproducts of heavy industry. My Nan had several stories about the Daren mountain, all told with a warning not to go up there.

There is a much long tale that can be told about the legend of the sin-eater, and the to-ing and fring about any truth of it, in the letters pages and the Victorian press and the early issues of the original folklore journals. If we can find a venue and a setting for it, perhaps I'll tell that tale one day.
