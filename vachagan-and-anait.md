# Vachagan and Anait

I'm sure I've heard my fellow *'Tis Tales* teller Holly Medland tell this tale, although she claims not to remember it, and I think I've also heard it elsewhere, or at least motifs from it, although I don't recall where offhand. Or maybe I just remember reading it in *A Mountain of Gems*, which provides the basis for my own telling of it, albeit with a few of tweaks *(this story is still unstable for me in the actual telling...)*:

> Prince Vachagan is out hunting, incognito, with his trusted friend; it's a hot day and they come to a village, where they are strange symbols on the walls; some women are at the well collecting cold water from the well. Vachagan approaches, and one woman offers a jug of water to Vachagan, but another knocks it away; this happens several times; Vachagan asks if they are mocking him in some way, or denying hospitality; the girl says the men were hot, the cold water would harm them; Vachagan asks the girl her name — Anait — and what does — daughter of a shepherdess; she asks his, but he cannot tell her. Vachagan pines for Anait, persuades his parents he should be allowed to marry her; Vachagan's loyal friend is sent as envoy; fine rug woven by Anait; she also teaches people how to read; Anait's father says decision to marry is Anait's, she says not in suitor has no trade. Vachagan learns to weave brocade, they are married; loyal friend / adviser goes missing; Vachagan becomes king; Anait says he should go incognito round kingdom; strange mountain city, powerful Chief Priest; Vachagan imprisoned in temple cellars: concentration camp, vats of boiling body parts for those who cannot work/have no trade; Vachagan says he can weave brocade from gold, worth 3 time more than any other brocade because of the design, talismans and sigils that only royalty might value; priest takes brocade, tries to sell it to Anait; she's reads message from husband; priest thrown in jail, Anait rescues husband and frees prisoners; thanked for saving them, then Vachagan says she saved him years before by insisting he had a trade.

?? maybe twist it to have Anait write a letter to Vachagan - so he must learn to read - that asks him to write her a letter in response (so he needs to learn to write) telling her his trade? Maybe the letter is read to him - he is embarrassed - and in having the letter written  - he thinks that maybe he should learn to write too... Or maybe he thinks he would like to write / useful so learns to write...
