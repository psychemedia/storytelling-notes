# The Richmond Drummer Boy 

The tale appears to be this:

> end 18th c; tunnel discovered from Richmond Castle to Easby Abbey, a mile or so; entrance discovered by soldiers but narrow, rubble from rockfalls; little drimmer boy lowered in and told to follow the tunnel beating his drum so soldiers above could hear it. All went well, for a while...out of the castle.. across the marketplace... over the river... as far as Easby woods; and then, the drumming stopped.

Was it a monster? Was it a rockfall? Some say the sound of the drum beat changed just before it disappeared, as if the boy had entered a large cavern. THe location of the sleeping King, Arthur, who likes with his soldiers awaiting the time when England needs him most. One of the knights awakes, asks whether England is under attack. No.  "Then it is not yet time to awaken King Arthur " rBut when we do awake, a drummer should lead us. WIll you wait with us? And the by did.

To linger here while the sun went down, and the shadows darkened behind the walls, and the glory streamed through the blank windows, was a rare enjoyment. It was dusk when I returned to the town, and there I finished with another stroll on the path under the castle, thinking of the ancient legend, and wishing for a peep at the mysterious vault where King Arthur's warriors lie asleep. Long, long ago, a man, while wandering about the hill, was conducted into an underground vault by a mysterious personage, and there he saw to his amazement a great multitude lying in deep slumber. Ere he recovered, his guide placed in his hands a horn and a sword ; he drew the blade half out of the sheath, when lo ! every sleeper stirred as if about to awake, and the poor mortal, terror-stricken, loosed his hold, the sword slid back, and the opportunity of release was lost, to recur no more for many a long day. The unlucky wight heard as he crept forth a bitter voice crying :

" Potter, Potter Thompson ! If thou had either drawn The sword or blown that horn, Thou'd been the luckiest man That ever was born."

For many a long year ago a Richmond wight, who rejoiced in the name of Thompson, and gained a living by making pots, was wandering about the purlieus of the castle one day when he suddenly came upon an opening which to his mind seemed to descend into the very bowels of the earth. Nothing daunted, he followed it, and emerged at last into a vault, where he found a great king and his knights fast bound in slumber. Hanging on the wall of the vault near to his hand was a horn and also a sword — Potter Thompson, possibly feeling that the sword was the most useful thing to lay hold of under these mysterious circumstances, did so lay hold of it, and half withdrew it from its scabbard. Whereupon arose a stirring and a murmuring amongst the sleeping company of king and knights, seeing and hearing which Thompson incontinently fled by the way he had come, and doubtless never stayed until he saw daylight But as he fled a voice cried behind him that if he had only drawn the sword or blown the horn he would have been the most fortunate man that ever lived. All of which is a mere sidelight on the legend — which some folk do in all honesty believe to be no legend but a truth — that King Arthur and his knights of the Round Table lie asleep beneath Richmond Castle, waiting until their services shall be needed for the salvation of Christendom.

A potter named Thompson is said to have discovered a tunnel entrance at the bottom of this cliff. Following it deep into the hillside, he came to a large cavern where slept King Arthur and his knights around the famous Round Table. On the table lay an ancient horn and a mighty sword. Young Thompson reached out and picked up the horn, but the sleepers began to awake and, fearing for his life, the potter fled. As he raced down the tunnel back to daylight and safety, he heard a voice behind him declare:

Potter Thompson, Potter Thompson!
If thou hadst drawn the sword or blown the horn,
Thou hadst been the luckiest man e'er was born.

The tunnel appears to have been well known, though the cave remains hidden. A second story tells how this subterranean passage is supposed to run from the Castle to nearby Easby Abbey. Some soldiers once sent a drummer-boy along it to test the theory and followed the sound of his drum almost halfway to the Abbey. Then the drumming stopped! The poor boy was never seen alive again - but his ghost is said to haunt the tunnel from where a slow drumbeat is still sometimes heard.

There once lived a man named Potter Thompson, whose wife was somewhat of a harridan. To escape her carping one day, Potter went for a long walk, eventually finding himself along the River Swale, just below Richmond Castle. As he stopped for a rest, Potter noticed an opening in the rocks below the castle. Upon investigating and peering inside, he saw a long passageway with a faint light in the distance. Potter entered and proceeded towards the light, where he found himself in a cavern surrounded by a sleeping king and his knights, dressed in full armor. Potter instantly recognized the royal figure as King Arthur due to the horn and legendary sword Excalibur, which were both resting on a nearby table.

Excited by his find, Potter decided to take Excalibur so he could prove to everyone that his story was true. However, as he removed the sword from its sheath, the sleeping knights began to stir. Consequently, Potter became scared and quickly decided to leave the cave. Upon his departure, he heard a sorrowful voice say:

"Potter Thompson, Potter Thompson
If Thou hadst either drawn
The sword, or blown the horn,
Thou wouldst have been the luckiest man
That ever yet was born."

Once outside and able to regain his composure, Potter turned back towards the entrance for another attempt, only to discover the opening had disappeared. He frantically searched the rocky banks of the castle but never again located the secret access once revealed to him
