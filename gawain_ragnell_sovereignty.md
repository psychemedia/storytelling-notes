# Sir Gawain and His Marriage to Lady Ragnell

This is one of the tales I remember hearing most frequently when we first started listening to storytellers, and it is one that I have a soft spot for.

The core of the tale is follows:

> King Arthur is out hunting and gets separated from his party;  he meets a knight who would challenge him, say Gawain has taken his lands from him. Arthur must give way, promising to return by the next New Year's Day with the answer to the question "What is it that a woman desire's the most?" else he will cut off his head. Arthur returns to court unhappily, sets out with Gawain for anwsers, but none of them seem satisfactory. On the way to meet the Lord, Arthur meets a hideous hag. She says she has the answer, but the price is that she weds Gawain. Arthur checks with Gawain, ho says he will do what he must for his King. She gives the answer to Arthur and he gives it to the Lord; and the Lord is angry - his sister must have told Arthur.
>
> Back at court, the hag arrives, eats noisily, and goes off with Gawain. He is astonished to see she is beautify; she says she is under an enchantment, will he have her fair by day and foul by night, or v.v. He flounders, says is it her choice. She is released from the curse and the next morning the court is surprised to see Gawain with the fair maiden.

The weddynge of S Gawen & Dame Ragnell.

[MS. Rawlinson, C.86, fol. 128. b ]

Lyhte! `[Klythe, MS.]` and liftenyth the lif' of a lord' riche,  
The while that he lyvid' was none hym liche,  
Nether in bowre ne in halle ;—  
In the tyme of Arthour thys adventure betyd,'—  
And' of the greatt adventure that he hym felf dyd',  
That kyng curteys & royall.  
Of alle kynge Arture beryth the flowyr,  
And' of alle knyghtod' he bare away the hono',  
Where foeu he wentt ;  
In hys contrey was no thyng butt chyvalry,  
And' knygtite were belovid' [by] that doughty,  
For cowarde were elmore fhent.  
Nowe wyll ye lyft a whyle to my talkyng,  
I fhall you tell of Arthowre the kyng,  
Howe ones hym befett ;  
On huntyng he was in Inglefwod',  
With alle his bold' knyghte good',—  
Nowe herkef to my fpell.  
The kyng was fett att his treftyll-tree,  
With his bowe to fle the wylde ven'e,  
And' hys lorde were fett hym befyde ;  
As the kyng ftode, then was he ware,  
Where a greatt hartt was and' a fayre,  
And' forth faft dyd' he glyde,  
The hartt was in a braken ferne,  
And' hard' the houndé, and' ftode full derne,  
Alle that fawe the kyng ;—  
" Hold' you ftyll, euy mah,  
And' I woll goo my felf, yf I can,  
With craft of ftalkyng."  
The kyng in hys hand' toke a bowe,  
And' wodmanly he ftowpyd' lowe,  
To ftalk' vnto that dere ;  
When that he cam the dere full nere,  
The dere lept forth into a brere,  
And eu the kyng went nere & nere.  
So kyng Arthure went a whyle,  
After the dere, I trowe, half a myle,  
And' no man with hym went ;  
And' att the laft to the dere he lett flye,  
And' fmote hym fore and' fewerly,  
Suche grace God' hym fent.  
Doun the dere tumblyd' fo deron,  
And' fell into a greatt brake of feron,  
The kyng folowyd' full faft ;  
Anon the kyng both ferce & fell  
Was with the dere, and' dyd' hym fvell `[ferve well?]`,  
And' after the graffe he tafte.  
As the kyng was with the dere alone,  
Streyght ther ca to hym a quaynt grome,  
Armyd' well and' fure ;  
A knyght full ftrong, and' of greatt myght,  
And' grymly worde to the kyng he fayd',—  
"Well i-mett, kyng Arthor!  
Thou haft me done wrong many a yere,  
And' wofully I fhatt quytte the here,  
I hold thy lyfe-days nygh done;  
Thou haft gevyn my lande, in certayn,  
With greatt wrong vnto S. Gawen,  
Whate fayest thou, kyng alone ?"  
" Syr knyght, whate is thy name, with honor?"  
" Syr kyng," he fayd', " Grom'fom Jour',  
I tell the nowe with ryght."—  
" A, S. Grom'fom', bethynk' the well,  
To fle me here honor getyft thou no det,  
Be-thynk' the thou artt a knyght.  
Yf thou fle me nowe in thys cafe,  
Alle knyghte woll refufe the in euy place,  
That fhame fhall new the froo ;  
Lett be thy wyll, and folowe wytt,  
And' that is amys I fhall amend?' itt,  
And' thou wolt, or that I goo."  
" Nay," fayd' S. Grom'fom", "by heuyn kyng!  
So fhalt thou nott fkape, withoute lefyng,  
I haue the nowe att avayll ;  
Yf I fhold' lett the thus goo with mokery,  
Anoder tyme thou wolt me defye,  
Of that I fhatt nott fayll."  
Now fayd' the kyng, " fo God' me faue,  
Save my lyfe, and' whate thou wolt crave  
I fhall now graunt itt the;  
Shame thou fhalt haue to fle me in ven'e,  
Thou armyd', and I clothyd' butt in grene, pde."  
" Alle thys fhatt nott help the, fekyrly,  
For I woll nother lond' ne gold' truly,  
Butt yf thou graunt me att a certayn day,  
Suche as I fhatt fett, and' in thys fame araye."  
" Yes," fayd' the kyng, "lo! here my hand'."  
" Ye, butt a-byde, kyng, and' here me a ftound'.  
Fyrft thow fhalt fwere, vpoh my fword' broun,  
To fhewe me att thy comyng whate wemefi love beft' in feld' and'  town ;
And' thou fhalt mete me here, with outen fend',  
Evyn att this day xij. monethes end' ;  
And' thou fhalt fwere vpoh my fwerd' good',  
That of thy knyghte fhall none com w' the, by the rood',  
Nowther frende `[fremde?]` ne freynd'.  
And' yf thou bryng nott anfwere, with oute fayll,  
Thyne hed' thou fhalt lofe for thy travayll,—  
Thys fhall nowe be thyne oth.  
Whate fayft thou, kyng, lett fe, haue done.""—  
" Syr, I graunt to thys, now lett me gone,  
Though itt be to me full loth.  
I enfure the, as I am true kyng,  
To com agayn att thys xij. monethes end',  
And' bryng the thyne anfwere."—  
" Now go thy way, kyng Arthure,  
Thy lyfe is in my hand' I am full fure,  
Of thy forowe thow artt nott ware.  
Abyde, kyng Arthure, a lytell whyle,  
Loke nott to day thou me begyle,  
And' kepe alle thyng in clofe ;  
For and' I wyft, by Mary mylde,  
Thou woldyft betray me in the feld',  
Thy lyf? fyrft fholdyft thou lofe."  
" Nay," fayd' kyng Arthure, "that may nott be,  
Vutrewe knyght fhalt thou new fynde me,  
To dye yett were me lever ;  
Farwett, S. knyght, and' evyll mett,  
I woll com, and' I be of lyve, att the day fett,  
Though I fhold' fcape neu."  
The kyng his bugle gan blowe,  
That hard' euy knygtit, and' itt gan knowe,  
Vnto hym can they rake ;  
Ther they fond' the kyng and' the dere,  
With fembland' fad' and' hevy chere,  
That had' no luft to layk'.  
" Go we home nowe to Carlyll,  
Thys huntyng lykys me nott well.'"—  
So fayd' kyng Arthure ;  
Alle the lord¢ knewe by his counten"nce,  
That the kyng had' mett with fume dyfturbaunce.  
Vnto Carlyll then the kyng cam,  
Butt of his hevyneffe knewe no man,  
His hartt was wonder hevy ;  
In this hevyneffe he dyd' a-byde,  
That many of his knyghte m'velyd' that tyde.  
Tyll att the laft S. Gaweh  
To the kyng he fayd' than,  
" Syr, me marvaylyth ryght fore,  
Whate thyng that thou forowyft fore."  
Then anfweryd' the kyng as tyght,  
"I fhall the tell, gentyll Gawen knyght.  
In the foreft as I was this daye,  
Ther I mett with a knygiit in his araye,  
And' fteyn worde to me he gan fayn,  
And' chargyd' me I fhold' hym nott bewrayne;  
His councell muft I kepe therfore,  
Or els I am forfwore."  
"Nay, drede you nott, lord', by Mary flower',  
I am nott that man that wold' you difhonor,  
Nother by euyn ne by moron."—  
" Forsoth I was of huntyng in Inglefwod',  
Thowe knoweft well I flewe an hartt, by the rode,  
Alle my fylf alon ;  
Ther mett I with a knyght armyd' fure,  
His name he told' me was S. Grom' fom' Joure,  
Therfor I make my mone.  
Ther that knyght faft dyd' me threte,  
And' wold' haue flay me with greatt heatt,  
But I fpak' fayre agayn;  
Wepyns with me ther had' I none,  
Alas! my worfhypp' therfor is nowe gone." —  
"What therof?" fayd' Gawen.  
" What nedys more, I fhall nott lye,  
He wold' haue flayn me ther with oute m'cy,  
And' that me was full loth;  
He made me to fwere that att the xij. monethes end',  
That I fhold' mete hym ther in the fame kynde,  
To that I plyght my trowith.  
And' alfo I fhold' tell hym att the fame day,  
Whate wemen defyren mofte, in good faye,  
My lyf' els fhold' I lefe `[leve, MS.]`;  
This oth I made vnto that knygitt,  
And' that I fhold' neu tell itt to no wight,  
Of thys I myght nott chefe.  
And' alfo I fhold' com in none oder araye,  
But euyn as I was the fame daye ;  
And' yf I faylyd' of myne anfwere,  
I wott I fhal be flay rygtt there.  
Blame me nott though I be a wofutt man,  
Alle thys is my drede and' fere."  
"Ye, S,, make good' chere,—  
Lett make yor hors redy,  
To ryde into ftraunge contrey ;  
And eu wher as ye mete owther man or woman, in faye,  
Ask' of theym whate thay therto faye.  
And' I fhall alfo ryde a noder waye,  
And' enquere of euy man and' woman, and' gett whatt I may,  
Of euy mah and' womans anfwere,  
And in a boke I fhall theym wryte."  
"I graunt," fayd' the kyng, as tyte,  
" Ytt is well advyfed, Gawen the good',  
Evyn by the holy rood' !"—  
Sone were they `[the, MS.]` both redy,  
Gawen and' the kyng, wytterly.  
The kyng rode on way, and' Gawen anoder,  
And eu enquyred' of man, woman, and' other,  
Whate wemen defyred' mofte dere.  
Somme fayd' they lovyd' to be well arayd',  
Somme fayd' they lovyd' to be fayre prayed';  
Somme fayd' they lovyd' a lufty mah,  
That in theyr armys can clypp' them and' kyffe them than ;  
Somme fayd' one, fomme fayd' other,  
And' fo had' Gawen getyn many an anfwer'.  
By that Gawen had' geten whate he maye,  
And come agayn by a certeyn daye ;  
Syr Gawen had' goten anfwerys fo many,  
That had' made a boke greatt, wytterly,  
To the courte he cam agayn;  
By that was the kyng comyn with hys boke,  
And' eyther on others pamplett dyd' loke,—  
"Thys may nott fayd' `[faylle?]`," fayd' Gawen.  
" By God'," fayd' the kyng, "I drede me fore,  
I caft me to feke a lytell more,  
In Ynglefwod' Foreft ;  
I haue butt a moneth to my day fett,  
I may hapeh oh fomme good' tydynge to hytt,  
Thys thynkyth me nowe beft."  
"Do as ye lyft," then Gawen fayd',  
" What fo eu ye do I hold' me payd',  
Hytt is good' to be fpyrryng ;  
Doute you nott, lord', ye fhait well fpede,  
Sume of yor fawes fhall help att nede,  
Els itt were yll lykyng."  
Kyng Arthoure rode forth on the other day,  
In to Ynglefwod' as hys gate laye,  
And' ther he mett with a lady ;  
She was as vngoodly a creature,  
As eu man fawe, withoute mefure,  
Kyng Arthure m'vaylyd' fecurly.  
Her face was red', her nofe fnotyd' withall,  
Her mowith wyde, her teth yalowe ou all,  
With bleryd' eyen gretter then a ball,  
Her mowith was nott to lak' ;  
Her teth hyng out her `[he, MS.]` lyppe,  
Her chekys fyde as wemens hyppe,  
A lute fhe bare vpon her bak'.  
Her nek' long and' therto greatt,  
Her here cloteryd of af hepe,  
In the fholders fhe was a yard' brode,  
Hangyng pappys to be an hors-lode,  
And' lyke a barell fhe was made ;  
And' to reherfe the fowlneffe of that lady,  
Ther is no tung may tell, fecurly,  
Of lothlyneffe inowgt fhe had'.  
She fatt on a palfray was gay begon,  
With gold befett, and many a precious ftone,  
Ther was an vnfemely fyght ;  
So fowll a creature, with oute mefure,  
To ryde fo gayly, I you enfure,  
Ytt was no reafoh ne ryght.  
She rode to Arthoure, and thus fhe fayd',  
" God' fpede, kyng, I am well payd',  
That I haue with the mett ;  
Speke with me, I rede, or thou goo,  
For thy lyfe is in my hand', I warn the foo,  
That fhalt thou fynde, and' I itt nott lett."  
" Why, what wold' ye, lady, nowe with me?"  
" Syr, I wold' fayn nowe fpeke with the,  
And tell the tydynge good' ;  
For alle the anfwerys that thou canft yelpe,  
None of theym alle fhall the helpe,  
That fhalt thou knowe, by the rood' !  
Thou wenyft I knowe nott thy councell,  
But I warn the I knowe itt euy deall,  
Yf `[In the MS. part of the previous line is carelessly repeated.]` I help the nott thou art butt dead? ;  
Graunt me, S. kyng, butt one thyng,  
And' for thy lyfe I make warrauntyng,  
Or elle thou fhalt lofe thy hed'."  
"Whate mean you, lady, tell me tygtit,  
For of thy worde I haue great difpyte,  
To you I haue no nede.  
Whate is yor defyre, fayre lady,  
Lett me wete fhortly,  
Whate is yor meanyng ;  
And' why my lyfe is in yor hand',  
Tell me, and' I fhall you warraunt,  
Alle yor oun afkyng ?"  
" For foth," fayd' the lady, "I am no qued',  
Thou muft graunt me a knyght to wed',  
His name is S. Gawen;  
And' fuche couen‘nt I woll make the,  
Butt thorowe myne anfwere thy lyf' fauyd' be,  
Elle lett my defyre be in vayne.  
And' yf myne anfwere faue thy lyf',  
Graunt me to be Gawens wyf',  
Advyfe the nowe, S. kyng;  
For itt muft be fo, or thou artt butt dead',  
Chofe nowe, for thou mayfte fone lofe thyne hed'.  
Tell me nowe in hying."  
"Mary," fayd' the kyng, "I maye nott graunt the,  
To make warrant S. Gawen to wed' the,  
Alle lyeth in hym alon ;  
Butt and' itt be fo, I woll do my labor,  
In favyng of my lyfe to make itt secor,  
To Gawen woll I make my mone."  
"Well," fayd' fhe, "nowe go home agayn,  
And' fayre worde fpeke to S. Gaweh,  
For thy lyf? I may faue ;  
Though I be foull, yett am I gaye,  
Thourgh me thy lyfe faue he maye,  
Or fewer thy deth to haue."  
" Alas !"? he fayd', " now woo is me,  
That I fhold' caufe Gawen to wed' the,  
For he wol be loth to faye naye ;  
So foull a lady as ye ar nowe one  
Sawe I neu in my lyfe on ground' gone,

" No force, S. kyng, thougt I be foull,  
Choyfe for a make hatti an owll,  
Thou geteft of me no more;  
When thou comyft agayn to thyne anfwer',  
Ryght in this place I shatt mete the here,  
Or elle I wott thou artt lore `[lore fowll, MS.]`."  
" Now farewell," fayd' the kyng, " lady,  
"Ye, S.," fhe fayd', "ther is a byrd' men catt ah owll `[Sic MS.]`,  
And' yett a lady I am ;"—  
" Whate is yor name, I pray you tell me?"  
" Syr kyng, I hight dame Ragneit, truly,  
That neu yett begylyd' man."  
" Dame Ragnell, nowe haue good' daye,"—  
" Syr kyng, God' fpede the on thy way,  
Ryght here I fhall the mete."  
Thus they departyd' fayre and' weit,  
The kyng full fone com to Carlyll,  
And' his hartt hevy and' greatt.  
The fyrfte man he mett was S. Gawen,  
That vnto the kyng thus gan fayn,  
" Syr, howe haue ye fped'?"  
" Forfoth," fayd' the kyng, " neu fo yll,  
Alas! I am in poynt my felf to fpyll,  
For nedely I moft be ded'."  
" Nay," fayd' Gawen, " that may nott be,

Thys is itt tydand'."  

" Gawefh, I mett to day with the fowlyft lady

Butt fyrft fhe wold' the to husbond' haue;

The Wedding of Sir Gawain and Dame Ragnell

ARTHUR, while hunting in Ingleswood, stalked and finally shot a great hart, which fell in a fern-brake. While the king, alone and far from his men, was engaged in making the assay, there appeared a groom, bearing the quaint name of Gromer Somer Joure, `[Sir Gromer occurs in "The Turke and Gowin," Percy MS., Hales and Furnivall, i., 102 ; Sir Grummore Grummorsum, " a good knight of Scotland," in Morte d' Arthur ed. Wright, i., 286, and elsewhere. Madden.]` who grimly told him that he meant now to requite him for having taken away his lands. Arthur represented that it would be a shame to knighthood for an armed man to kill a man in green, and offered him any satisfaction. The only terms Gromer would grant were that Arthur should come back alone to that place that day twelvemonth, and then tell him what women love best ; not bringing the right answer, he was to lose his head. The king gave his oath, and they parted. The knights, summoned by the king's bugle, found him in heavy cheer, and the reason he would at first tell no man, but after a while he took Gawain into confidence. Gawain advised that they two should ride into strange country in different directions, put the question to every man and woman they met, and write the answers in a book. This they did, and each made a large collection. Gawain thought they could not fail, but the king was anxious, and considered that it would be prudent to spend the only month that was left in prosecuting the inquiry in the region of Ingleswood. Gawain agreed that it was good to be speering, and bade the king doubt not that some of his saws should help at need.

Arthur rode to Ingleswood, and met a lady riding on a richly caparisoned palfrey, but herself of a hideousness which beggars words ; nevertheless the items are not spared. She came up to Arthur, and told him that she knew his counsel; none of his answers would help. If he would grant her one thing, she would warrant his life ; otherwise, he must lose his head. This one thing was that she should be Gawain's wife. The king said this lay with Gawain ; he would do what he could, but it were a pity to make Gawain wed so foul a lady. " No matter," she rejoined, " though I be foul, choice for a mate hath an owl. "When thou comest to thine answer, I shall meet thee ; else art thou lost."

The king returned to Carlisle with a heart no lighter, and the first man he saw was Gawain, who asked him how he had sped. Never so ill ; he had met a lady who had offered to save his life, but she was the foulest he had ever seen, and the condition was that Gawain should be her husband. " Is that all? " said Gawain. "I will wed her once and again, though she were the devil; else were I no friend." Well might the king exclaim, "Of all knights thou bearest the flower ! "

After five or six days more the time came for the answer. The king had hardly ridden a mile into the forest when he met the lady, by name Dame Ragnell. He told her Gawain should wed her, and demanded her answer. "Some say this, and some say that, but above all things women desire to have the sovereignty; `[See Note at the end of this paper : " Women desire Sovereignty."]` tell this to the knight ; he will curse her that told thee, for his labour is lost." Arthur, thus equipped, rode on as fast as he could go, through mire and fen. Gromer was waiting, and sternly demanded the answer. Arthur offered his two books, for Dame Ragnell had told him to save himself by any of those answers if he could. " Nay, nay, king," said Grorner, " thou art but a dead man." " Abide, Sir Gromer, I have an answer shall make all sure. Women desire sovereignty."

" She that told thee that was my sister, Dame Ragnell. I pray , I may see her burn on a fire." And so they parted.

Dame Ragnell was also waiting for Arthur, and would hear of nothing but immediate fulfilment of her bargain. She followed the king to his court, and required him to produce Gawain instantly, who came and plighted his troth. The queen begged her to be married privately, and early in the morning. Dame Ragnell would consent to no such arrangement. She would not go to church till high-mass time, and she would dine in the open hall. At her wedding she was dressed more splendidly than the queen, and she sat at the head of the table at the dinner afterwards. There her appetite was all but as horrible as her person : she ate three capons, three curlews, and great bake meats all that was set before her, less and more.

A leaf is wanting now, but what followed is easily imagined. She chided Gawain for his offishness, and begged him to kiss her, at least. "I will do more," said Gawain, and, turning, beheld the fairest creature he ever saw. But the transformed lady told him that her beauty would not hold : he must choose whether she should be fair by night and foul by day, or fair by day and foul by night. `[]` Gawain said the choice was hard, and left all to her. " Gramercy," said the lady, " thou shalt have me fair both day and night." Then she told him that her step-dame had turned her into that monstrous shape by necromancy, net to recover her own till the best knight in England had wedded her and given her sovereignty in all points.

A charming little scene follows, in which Arthur visits Gawain in the morning, fearing lest the fiend may have slain him.

1 This is the scene in the bridal chamber next morning :

[715] I telle you, in certeyne,
Withe joye & myrthe they wakyde tylle daye,
And thane wolde rise that fayre maye, `[mayd, MS.]`
'Ye shalle nott.' sir Gawene sayde ;
' We wolle lye, & slepe tylle pryme,
[720] And thene lett the kyng calle vs to dyne.'
' I ame greed,' then sayde the mayde.
Thus itt passyde forth tylle mid-daye.
' Syrs,' `[Syr, MS.]` quode the kyng, 'lett vs go ande asaye,
Yf sir Gawene be one lyve.
[725] I ame fulle ferde of sir Gawene
Nowe, lest the fende haue hyme slayne ;
Nowe wolde I fayne preve.
Go we nowe,' sayde Arthoure the kyng,
' We wolle go se theyr vprysing,
[730] How welle that he hathe spede.'
They came to the chambre, alle in certeyne ;
' Aryse,' sayde the kyng to sir Gawene,
' Why slepyst thou so long in bede ? '
' Mary,' quode Gawene, ' sir kyng, sicurly,

For I am fulle welle att eas ;
Abyde, ye shalle se the dore vndone,

[740] Sir Gawene rose, ande in his hande he toke
His fayr lady, ande to the dore he shoke,
Ande opynyde the dore fulle fayre ;
Sbe stode in her smoke alle by that syre,

On this ballad, Sir F. Madden suggests, was founded that of the " Marriage of Sir Gawaine," which Percy printed, supplying from conjecture the _lacunae_, in the first edition of his _Reliques of Ancient English Poetry_, 1765, and the two subsequent editions. It is thus given in the _Percy Folio MS._, edited by Drs. Hales and Furnivall, vol. i., and reproduced by Prof. Child :

**The Marriage of Sir Gawaine**

`[King Arthur is at Carlisle, keeping a merry Christmas.]`

[1] Kinge Arthur liues in merry Carlisle,  
And seemely is to see,  
And there he hath with him Queene Genever,  
That bride soe bright of blee.

[2] And there he hath with him Queene Genever,  
That bride soe bright in bower,  
And all his barons about him stoode,  
That were both stiffe and stowre.

[3] The king kept a royall Christmasse,  
Of mirth and great honor,  
And when ...

---

`['And for ransom bring me word what is the great desire of women.' Arthur agrees to these terms, and goes back to Carlisle, moaning. Arthir tells Gawain of his encounter with the Baron at Tearne Wadling, and that to get of fighting him, he must find out, by New Year's Day, what a woman most desires. Arthur sets forth to fulfil his engagement. Crossing a moor, he sees a very hideous lady,]`

[4] ' And bring me word what thing it is  
That a woman [doth] most desire ;  
This shall be thy ransome, Arthur, he sayes,  
' For he haue noe other hier.'

[5] King Arthur then held vp his hand,  
According thene as was the law ;  
He tooke his leaue of the baron there,  
And hoinward can `['gan, began.]` he draw.

[6] And when he came to merry Carlile,  
To his chamber he is gone,  
And ther came to him his cozen Sir Gawaine,  
As he did make his mone.

[7] And there came to him his cozen Sir Gawaine,  
That was a curteous knight ;  
' Why sigh you soe sore, vncle Arthur,' he said,
' Or who hath done thee vnright ? '

[8] 'O peace, O peace, thou gentle Gawaine,  
That faire may thee beffall !  
For if thou knew my sighing soe deepe,  
Thou wold not meruaile att all.

[9] 'Ffor when I came to Tearne Wadling, `[A town in Inglewond Forest, near Hesketh, in CunilxTland ; sometimes written Tearne Wathelyne.]`  
A bold barron there I fand,  
With a great club vpon his backe,  
Standing stiife and strong.

[10] ' And he asked me wether I wold fight  
Or from him I shold begone,  
O[r] else I must him a ransome pay,  
And soe depart him from.

[11] 'To fight with him I saw noe cause ;  
Methought it was not meet ;  
For he was stiffe and strong with-all,  
His strokes were nothing sweete.

[12] 'Therefor this is my ransome, Gawaine,  
I ought to him to pay ;  
I must come againe, as I am sworne,  
Vpon the New Yeers day ;

[13] 'And I must bring him word what thing it is  
[That a woman doth most desire.]

---

[14] Then king Arthur drest him for to ryde,  
In one soe rich array,  
Toward the fore-said Tearne Wadling,  
Thai he might keepe his day.

[15] And as he rode over a more,  
Hee see a lady where shee sate  
Betwixt an oke and a greene hollen ;  
She was cladd in red Scarlett. `[This was a common phrase in our old writers: so Chaucer, in his Prologue to the Canterbury Tales, says of the Wife of Bath : " Her hosen were of fyne scarlet red." — Percy.]`

`[with one eye instead of her mouth, and a crooked pose. She asks, 'Who are you ? Fear not me. Perhaps I may succour you.' ' Succour me, and Gawain shall marry you.']`

[16] Then there as shold haue stood her mouth,  
Then there was sett her eye ;  
The other was in her forhead fast,  
The way that she might see.

[17] Her nose was crooked and turnd outward,  
Her mouth stood foule a-wry ;  
A worse formed lady than shee was,  
Neuer man saw with his eye.

[18] To halch vpon him, King Arthur,  
This lady was full faine,  
But King Arthur had forgott his lesson  
What he shold say againe.

[19] 'What knight art thou,' the lady sayd,  
' That will not speak to me ?  
Of me be thou nothing dismayd,  
Tho I be vgly to see.

[20] For I haue halched you curteouslye,  
And you will not me againe ;  
Yett I may happen, Sir Knight,' shee said,  
' To ease thee of thy paine.'

[21] ' Giue thou ease me, lady,' he said,  
' Or helpe me in any thing,  
Thou shalt have gentle Gawaine, my cozen,  
And marry him with a ring.'

[22] ' Why, if I help thee not, thou noble King Arthur,  
Of thy owne hearts desiringe,  
Of gentle Gawaine ....

`[At the tarn he finds the Baron, who thinks Arthur cannot produce the ransom or answer, and claims him and his land. Arthur bids him wait a bit, then gives the answer: 'A woman will have her will.' The Baron curses the lady (his sister, it turns out).]`

[23] And when he came to the Tearne Wadling,  
The baron there cold he finde,  
With a great weapon on his backe,  
Standing stiffe and stronge.

[24] And then he tooke 'King Arthur's letters in his hands,  
And away he cold them fling,  
And then he puld out a good browne sword,  
And cryd himselfe a king.

[25] And he sayd, ' I have thee and thy land, Arthur,  
To doe as it pleaseth me,  
For this is not thy ransome sure,  
Therfore yeeld thee to me.'

[26] And then bespoke him noble Arthur,  
And bad him hold his hand :  
' And giue me leaue to speake my mind  
In defence of all my land.'

[27] He said, 'As I came over a more,  
I see a lady where shee sate  
Betweene an oke and a green hollen ;  
Shee was clad in red scarlett.

[28] ' And she says a woman will haue her will,  
And this is all her cheef desire :  
Doe me right, as thou art a baron of sckill,  
This is thy ransome and all thy hyer.'

[29] He sayes, 'An early vengeance light on her !  
She walkes on yonder more ;  
It was my sister that told thee this,  
And she is a misshappen hore.

[30] ' But heer Ile make mine avow to God  
To doe her an euill turne,  
For an euer I may thate fowle theefe get,  
In a fyer I will her burne.'

`[A company of knights, riding out with the King and Sir Gawain meet the hag. Sir Kay does not fancy her to kiss. Sir Gawain bids him to be quiet, for one of them  must have her to wife. Sir Kay says he had rather perish than it should be he. The others are of the same mind. Arthur reproves his knights.]`

[31] Sir Lancelott and Sir Steven bold, `[Sir Steven does not occur (says Madden) in the Round Table romances.]`  
They rode with them that day,  
And the formost of the company  
There rode the steward Kay.

[32] Soe did Sir Banier and Sir Bore,  
Sir Garrett `[Banier, probably, according to the same authority, a mistake for Bediuer, the King's Constable — Tennyson's Bedivere. Bore is Bors de Gaunes (or Gannes), brother of Lionel. Garrett is Gareth, or Gaheriet, Sir Gawaine's younger brother. Percy MS., Hales and Furnivall.]` with them soe gay,  
Soe did Sir Tristeraru, thai gentle knight,  
To the forrest fresh and gay.

[33] And when he came to the greene forrest,  
Vnderneath a greene holly tree,  
Their sate that lady in red scarlet  
That vnseemly was to see.

[34] Sir Kay beheld this ladys face,  
And looked vppon her swire ;  
' Whosoeuer kisses this lady,' he sayes,  
' Of his kisse he stands in feare,'

[35] Sir Kay beheld the lady againe,  
And looked vpon her snout ;  
' Whosoeuer kisses this lady,' he sayes,  
' Of his kisse he stands in doubt.'

[36] ' Peace, cozen Kay,' then said Sir Gawaine,  
' Amend thee of thy life ;
For there is a knight amongst vs all,  
That must marry her to his wife.'

[37] ' What ! wedd her to wiffe ! ' then said Sir Kay,  
' In the diuells name anon !  
Gett me a wiffe where-ere I may,  
For I had rather be slaine ! '

[38] Then some tooke vp their hawkes in hast,  
And some tooke vp their hounds,  
And some sware they wold not marry her  
For citty nor for towne.

[39] And then be-spake him noble King Arthur, 
And sware there by this day,  
'For a litle foule sight and misliking

`[Gawain's bride asks whether her foul by day or night. Gawain answers, 'By day.' 'Then i must hide from your companions.' 'No ; do as you like.' 'Bless you, Gawain, you have cured me. I was witched into the likeness of a fiend.']`

[40] Then shee said, ' Choose thee, gentle Gawaine,  
Truth as I doe say, win have her foul
Wether thou wilt haue me in this liknesse  
In the night or else in the day.'

[41] And then bespake him gentle Gawaine,  
Was one soe mild of moode,  
Sayes, ' Well I know what I wold say,  
God grant it may be good !

[42] ' To haue thee fowle in the night  
When I with thee shold play  
Yet I had rather, if I might,  
Haue thee fowle in the day.'

[43] 'What ! when lords goe with ther feires,' shee said  
'Both to the ale and wine,  
Alas ! then I must hyde my selfe,  
I must not goe withinne.'

[44] And then bespake him gentle Gawaine,  
Said, ' Lady, that's but skill ;  
And because thou art my owne lady  
Thou shalt haue all thy will.'

[45] Then she said, ' Blessed be thou, gentle Gawaine, 
This day that I thee see,  
For as thou seest me att this time,  
From hencforth I wilbe.

[46] ' My father was an old knight,  
And yet it chanced soe  
That he marryed a younge lady  
That brought me to this woe.


[47] ' Shee witched me, being a faire young lady,  
To the greene forrest to dwell,  
And there I must walke in womans liknesse,  
Most like a feend of hell.

[48] ' She witch my brother to a carlisli b . . .

`['Kiss her, brother Kay', says Gawain, 'and regret your rudeness'. Kay kisses her, and congratulates Gawain. He and Kay take the lady between them, and lead her to King Arthur who thanks God for Gawain's bliss. All the knights rejoice.]`

[49] . . .
. . .
That looked soe foule, and that was wont  
On the wild more to goe.'

[50] 'Come kisse her, brother Kay,' then said Sir Gawaine,  
' And amend thé of thy liffe ;  
I sweare this is the same lady  
That I marryed to my wiffe.'

[51] ' Sir [Kay he] kissed that lady bright,  
Standing vpon his ffeete ;  
He swore, as he was trew knight,  
The spice was neuer soe svveete.

[52] ' Well, cozen Gawaine,' sayes Sir Kay,  
' Thy chance is fallen arright,  
For thou hast gotten one of the fairest maids ,  
I euer saw with my sight.'

[53] ' It is my fortune,' said Sir Gawaine ;  
' For my vncle Arthurs sake  
I am glad as grasse wold be of raine,  
Great ioy that I may take.'

[54] Sir Gawaine tooke the lady by the one arme,  
them, Sir Kay tooke her by the tother,  
They led her straight to King Arthur,  
As they were brother and brother.

[55] King Arthur welcomed them there all,  
And soe did Lady Geneuer his queene,  
With all the knights of the Round Table,  
Most seemly to be seene.

[56] King Arthur beheld that lady faire  
That was soe faire and bright,  
He thanked Christ in Trinity  
For Sir Gawame, that gentle knight.

[57] Soe did the knights, both more and lesse,  
All the knights rejoice.
Rejoyced all that day  
For the good chance that happened was  
To Sir Gawaine and his lady gay.

CHAPTER 6 — GAWAIN

...

The last poem of this group is _The Wedding of Sir Gawain and Dame Ragnell_, originally 925 lines in length. `[A leaf is wanting in the unique MS.]` It is in the South Midland dialect of about 1450. As in so many of these poems it opens with a hunting expedition by Arthur. He parts company with the others to pursue a giant hart, and meets a knight named Sir Gromersomer Joure, who claims that his lands have been wrongfully given to Sir Gawain, and says that he will kill Arthur unless he finds out within a year what women most desire. Arthur has to promise to return, and sets about finding the required answer. He is given enough different replies to fill a large volume; but on the day before his appointment with Gromersomer Joure he meets a hideous hag who tells him that she alone knows the correct one, which she will give him on condition that she may wed Gawain. The King says that he will ask Gawain, who agrees without hesitation. The hag, by name Dame Ragnell, then informs Arthur that women most desire ‘to have the sovereignty'. She will only hold him to the bargain if this is the right answer. Having tried all the other replies, Arthur finally gives Gromersomer Joure that of the hag, which is indeed correct. Gawain has to wed her, to the sorrow of the court, even though he seems cheerful enough. At the wedding feast Ragnell disgusts everyone by eating as much as six men. They retire to bed, and Ragnell demands a kiss from her husband. It is given and she turns into a beautiful maiden, who says that she may be like this either by day or night, according to his choice. Gawain, in accordance with the answer she had given Arthur earlier, puts the matter in her hands, and as a result is told that she will always retain her new form.

This story, of the loathly bride who must win a handsome husband in order to be freed from a spell, is one of the commonest of folk-tales. An Irish version occurs in the twelfth-century Book of Ballynote; the present version may have been Scandinavian in origin, or have been influenced by Scandinavian tales, especially in the detail of the bride's grotesque appetite.

Other English tellings of it are to be found in Gower's Confessio Amantis, and in The Wife of Bath's Tale. The Chaucerian version is probably the best-known of the three, but has the least connections with Arthur. The introduction would appear to show that Chaucer knew the story on which The Gest of Sir Gawain was based; for the main story, he used, with free adaptations, an earlier version of _The Wedding of Sir Gawain_. It is the rape of Brandelis's sister which is the central incident of The Gest of Sir Gawain that causes the question: ‘What do women most desire?' Gawain is fittingly punished by having to marry the hideous hag who provides the answer. The feast, obviously in Chaucer's original, is omitted, with the remark that there was no feasting on such a sad occasion. And the final choice is very different: Gawain's bride can either remain hideous and be faithful to her husband, or he can have her beautiful and take his chance. By giving her the choice, he gets her both beautiful and faithful.

Both this free version, and the rather closer one of _The Wedding of Sir Gawain_ come from a common original in which Gawain was hero, since Chaucer is unlikely to have added an Arthurian background, and yet, because of the discrepancy in dates, cannot have used the present version of The Wedding. Malory must have known either this or its predecessor, for he mentions Sir Gromersomer Joure. `[Identical with Sir Grummor Grummorson.]`

There is little remarkable in the poem's style, which is very much inferior to _The Wife of Bath's Tale_, although less crude and grotesque than the other works of the ‘primitive' group. Had the Chaucerian version stronger associations with Arthurian literature, it would rank as second only to Sir Gawain and the Green Knight. As it is, it hardly falls within our scope, having no more than a name or two and half a dozen lines of introduction to identify it with Arthur and his court.

> Arthur returns to Carlisle and tells Gawain about Sir Gromer's challenge. At Gawain's suggestion, the pair separates and rides through the country, collecting answers in a book. With a month to go, Arthur returns to Ingleswood and meets a monstrously ugly woman, Dame Ragnell. She promises to give Arthur the correct answer, on the condition that he marries her to Sir Gawain. Arthur reluctantly consults Gawain, who agrees because of his love for the king. Arthur returns to the forest once more, where Ragnell tells him that all women want ‘sovereignty'.
>
> When the year is up, Arthur returns to Sir Gromer and gives him his answer. The knight curses Ragnell, his sister, for helping the king, but has to admit that he is right. Ragnell returns to Carlisle with Arthur and insists on a lavish marriage in front of the whole court. Everyone marvels at her ugliness as she devours the splendid wedding banquet. [The couple retire] and Ragnell rebukes Gawain for his lack of sexual desire. He turns to find his wife transformed into a beautiful woman. She offers him a choice: she can be beautiful either at night or during the day. Gawain cannot decide, and tells his wife to make the decision. Delighted, she informs him that he has broken an enchantment placed on her by her stepmother: now that the best knight in England has given her sovereignty, she can be beautiful all the time. The couple go to bed.
>
> When Arthur checks on Gawain the next day, the knight shows him his beautiful wife. The king rejoices, and tells the court about Sir Gromer. Ragnell promises to obey Gawain in all things, and asks Arthur to be good to her brother; everyone agrees that she is the fairest lady at the court. She and Gawain have a son, Gyngolyn, and live in perfect harmony for five years until she dies. The poem concludes with a prayer that its author be released from prison.

> King Arthur spends Christmas at Carlisle with Guinevere and his barons. [While hunting near the Tarn Wathelane, he is accosted by a ferocious baron] who agrees to release him if he returns in a year's time with an answer to the question ‘what do women most desire?' Arthur returns to Carlisle and confides in Gawain, describing the strength and ferocity of the unknown knight. [Arthur and Gawain search for an answer to the question, collecting a sheaf of answers without success]. On the appointed day, Arthur sets out for the Tarn. On his way he meets a hideous crone, dressed in scarlet. She rebukes him for his discourteous greeting, but offers to help him. He eagerly agrees, offering her Gawain in marriage. [She gives him an answer] and he continues on his way. The baron rejects Arthur's sheaf of answers, claiming the king as his captive, until Arthur gives him the crone's reply: ‘a woman desires to have her will'. Vowing to be revenged against the crone, his sister, he admits that Arthur is right and releases him.
>
> [Arthur returns to court and gathers his knights] They all ride into the forest until they come to the crone. Kay scorns her ugliness, but Gawain cryptically remarks that one of them must marry her. Kay and the other knights refuse, [but Gawain agrees and they all return to court. After the wedding, Gawain and his bride retire to his chamber. She transforms into a beautiful young maiden] and offers him a choice: she can be beautiful during the day or during the night. When he chooses night, she reprimands him, reminding him of their public humiliation. He replies that he was simply testing her, and grants her ‘her will'. Delighted, she promises to be beautiful all the time, informing him that she and her brother were bewitched by their wicked stepmother. [They consummate the marriage, and when Kay comes to check on them in the morning, Gawain relates his wife's story]. Kay kisses the maiden, praising her beauty, and they all go to Arthur. The whole court welcomes them and they celebrate.
