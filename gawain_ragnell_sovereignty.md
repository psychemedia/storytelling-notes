The Wedding of Sir Gawain and Dame Ragnell

ARTHUR, while hunting in Ingleswood, stalked and finally shot a great hart, which fell in a fern-brake. While the king, alone and far from his men, was engaged in making the assay, there appeared a groom, bearing the quaint name of Gromer Somer Joure, `[Sir Gromer occurs in "The Turke and Gowin," Percy MS., Hales and Furnivall, i., 102 ; Sir Grummore Grummorsum, " a good knight of Scotland," in Morte d' Arthur ed. Wright, i., 286, and elsewhere. Madden.]` who grimly told him that he meant now to requite him for having taken away his lands. Arthur represented that it would be a shame to knighthood for an armed man to kill a man in green, and offered him any satisfaction. The only terms Gromer would grant were that Arthur should come back alone to that place that day twelvemonth, and then tell him what women love best ; not bringing the right answer, he was to lose his head. The king gave his oath, and they parted. The knights, summoned by the king's bugle, found him in heavy cheer, and the reason he would at first tell no man, but after a while he took Gawain into confidence. Gawain advised that they two should ride into strange country in different directions, put the question to every man and woman they met, and write the answers in a book. This they did, and each made a large collection. Gawain thought they could not fail, but the king was anxious, and considered that it would be prudent to spend the only month that was left in prosecuting the inquiry in the region of Ingleswood. Gawain agreed that it was good to be speering, and bade the king doubt not that some of his saws should help at need.

Arthur rode to Ingleswood, and met a lady riding on a richly caparisoned palfrey, but herself of a hideousness which beggars words ; nevertheless the items are not spared. She came up to Arthur, and told him that she knew his counsel; none of his answers would help. If he would grant her one thing, she would warrant his life ; otherwise, he must lose his head. This one thing was that she should be Gawain's wife. The king said this lay with Gawain ; he would do what he could, but it were a pity to make Gawain wed so foul a lady. " No matter," she rejoined, " though I be foul, choice for a mate hath an owl. "When thou comest to thine answer, I shall meet thee ; else art thou lost."

The king returned to Carlisle with a heart no lighter, and the first man he saw was Gawain, who asked him how he had sped. Never so ill ; he had met a lady who had offered to save his life, but she was the foulest he had ever seen, and the condition was that Gawain should be her husband. " Is that all? " said Gawain. "I will wed her once and again, though she were the devil; else were I no friend." Well might the king exclaim, "Of all knights thou bearest the flower ! "

After five or six days more the time came for the ansAver. The king had hardly ridden a mile into the forest when he met the lady, by name Dame Eagnell. He told her Gawaiii should wed her, and demanded her answer. "Some say this, and some say that, but above all things women desire to have the sovereignty; `[See Note at the end of this paper : " Women desire Sovereignty."]` tell this to the knight ; he will curse her that told thee, for his labour is lost." Arthur, thus equipped, rode on as fast as he could go, through mire and fen. Gromer was waiting, and sternly demanded the answer. Arthur offered his two books, for Dame Ragnell had told him to save himself by any of those answers if he could. " Nay, nay, king," said Grorner, " thou art but a dead man." " Abide, Sir Gromer, I have an answer shall make all sure. Women desire sovereignty."

" She that told thee that was my sister, Dame Ragnell. I pray , I may see her burn on a fire." And so they parted.

Dame Ragnell was also waiting for Arthur, and would hear of nothing but immediate fulfilment of her bargain. She followed the king to his court, and required him to produce Gawain instantly, who came and plighted his troth. The queen begged her to be married privately, and early in the morning. Dame Ragnell would consent to no such arrangement. She would not go to church till high-mass time, and she would dine in the open hall. At her wedding she was dressed more splendidly than the queen, and she sat at the head of the table at the dinner afterwards. There her appetite was all but as horrible as her person : she ate three capons, three curlews, and great bake meats all that was set before her, less and more.

A leaf is wanting now, but what followed is easily imagined. She chided Gawain for his offishness, and begged him to kiss her, at least. "I will do more," said Gawain, and, turning, beheld the fairest creature he ever saw. But the transformed lady told him that her beauty would not hold : he must choose whether she should be fair by night and foul by day, or fair by day and foul by night. `[]` Gawain said the choice was hard, and left all to her. " Gramercy," said the lady, " thou shalt have me fair both day and night." Then she told him that her step-dame had turned her into that monstrous shape by necromancy, net to recover her own till the best knight in England had wedded her and given her sovereignty in all points.

A charming little scene follows, in which Arthur visits Gawain in the morning, fearing lest the fiend may have slain him.

On this ballad, Sir F. Madden suggests, was founded that of the " Marriage of Sir Gawaine," which Percy printed, supplying from conjecture the *lacunae*, in the first edition of his *Reliques of Ancient English Poetry*, 1765, and the two subsequent editions. It is thus given in the *Percy Folio MS.*, edited by Drs. Hales and Furnivall, vol. i., and reproduced by Prof. Child :

__The Marriage of Sir Gawaine__

And seemely is to see,  
And there he hath with him Queene Genever,

CHAPTER 6 — GAWAIN

...

The last poem of this group is *The Wedding of Sir Gawain and Dame Ragnell*, originally 925 lines in length. `[A leaf is wanting in the unique MS.]` It is in the South Midland dialect of about 1450. As in so many of these poems it opens with a hunting expedition by Arthur. He parts company with the others to pursue a giant hart, and meets a knight named Sir Gromersomer Joure, who claims that his lands have been wrongfully given to Sir Gawain, and says that he will kill Arthur unless he finds out within a year what women most desire. Arthur has to promise to return, and sets about finding the required answer. He is given enough different replies to fill a large volume; but on the day before his appointment with Gromersomer Joure he meets a hideous hag who tells him that she alone knows the correct one, which she will give him on condition that she may wed Gawain. The King says that he will ask Gawain, who agrees without hesitation. The hag, by name Dame Ragnell, then informs Arthur that women most desire ‘to have the sovereignty’. She will only hold him to the bargain if this is the right answer. Having tried all the other replies, Arthur finally gives Gromersomer Joure that of the hag, which is indeed correct. Gawain has to wed her, to the sorrow of the court, even though he seems cheerful enough. At the wedding feast Ragnell disgusts everyone by eating as much as six men. They retire to bed, and Ragnell demands a kiss from her husband. It is given and she turns into a beautiful maiden, who says that she may be like this either by day or night, according to his choice. Gawain, in accordance with the answer she had given Arthur earlier, puts the matter in her hands, and as a result is told that she will always retain her new form.

This story, of the loathly bride who must win a handsome husband in order to be freed from a spell, is one of the commonest of folk-tales. An Irish version occurs in the twelfth-century Book of Ballynote; the present version may have been Scandinavian in origin, or have been influenced by Scandinavian tales, especially in the detail of the bride’s grotesque appetite.

Other English tellings of it are to be found in Gower’s Confessio Amantis, and in The Wife of Bath’s Tale. The Chaucerian version is probably the best-known of the three, but has the least connections with Arthur. The introduction would appear to show that Chaucer knew the story on which The Gest of Sir Gawain was based; for the main story, he used, with free adaptations, an earlier version of *The Wedding of Sir Gawain*. It is the rape of Brandelis’s sister which is the central incident of The Gest of Sir Gawain that causes the question: ‘What do women most desire?’ Gawain is fittingly punished by having to marry the hideous hag who provides the answer. The feast, obviously in Chaucer’s original, is omitted, with the remark that there was no feasting on such a sad occasion. And the final choice is very different: Gawain’s bride can either remain hideous and be faithful to her husband, or he can have her beautiful and take his chance. By giving her the choice, he gets her both beautiful and faithful.

Both this free version, and the rather closer one of *The Wedding of Sir Gawain* come from a common original in which Gawain was hero, since Chaucer is unlikely to have added an Arthurian background, and yet, because of the discrepancy in dates, cannot have used the present version of The Wedding. Malory must have known either this or its predecessor, for he mentions Sir Gromersomer Joure. `[Identical with Sir Grummor Grummorson.]`

There is little remarkable in the poem’s style, which is very much inferior to *The Wife of Bath’s Tale*, although less crude and grotesque than the other works of the ‘primitive’ group. Had the Chaucerian version stronger associations with Arthurian literature, it would rank as second only to Sir Gawain and the Green Knight. As it is, it hardly falls within our scope, having no more than a name or two and half a dozen lines of introduction to identify it with Arthur and his court.

> Arthur returns to Carlisle and tells Gawain about Sir Gromer’s challenge. At Gawain’s suggestion, the pair separates and rides through the country, collecting answers in a book. With a month to go, Arthur returns to Ingleswood and meets a monstrously ugly woman, Dame Ragnell. She promises to give Arthur the correct answer, on the condition that he marries her to Sir Gawain. Arthur reluctantly consults Gawain, who agrees because of his love for the king. Arthur returns to the forest once more, where Ragnell tells him that all women want ‘sovereignty’.
>
> When the year is up, Arthur returns to Sir Gromer and gives him his answer. The knight curses Ragnell, his sister, for helping the king, but has to admit that he is right. Ragnell returns to Carlisle with Arthur and insists on a lavish marriage in front of the whole court. Everyone marvels at her ugliness as she devours the splendid wedding banquet. [The couple retire] and Ragnell rebukes Gawain for his lack of sexual desire. He turns to find his wife transformed into a beautiful woman. She offers him a choice: she can be beautiful either at night or during the day. Gawain cannot decide, and tells his wife to make the decision. Delighted, she informs him that he has broken an enchantment placed on her by her stepmother: now that the best knight in England has given her sovereignty, she can be beautiful all the time. The couple go to bed.
>
> When Arthur checks on Gawain the next day, the knight shows him his beautiful wife. The king rejoices, and tells the court about Sir Gromer. Ragnell promises to obey Gawain in all things, and asks Arthur to be good to her brother; everyone agrees that she is the fairest lady at the court. She and Gawain have a son, Gyngolyn, and live in perfect harmony for five years until she dies. The poem concludes with a prayer that its author be released from prison.

> King Arthur spends Christmas at Carlisle with Guinevere and his barons. [While hunting near the Tarn Wathelane, he is accosted by a ferocious baron] who agrees to release him if he returns in a year’s time with an answer to the question ‘what do women most desire?’ Arthur returns to Carlisle and confides in Gawain, describing the strength and ferocity of the unknown knight. [Arthur and Gawain search for an answer to the question, collecting a sheaf of answers without success]. On the appointed day, Arthur sets out for the Tarn. On his way he meets a hideous crone, dressed in scarlet. She rebukes him for his discourteous greeting, but offers to help him. He eagerly agrees, offering her Gawain in marriage. [She gives him an answer] and he continues on his way. The baron rejects Arthur’s sheaf of answers, claiming the king as his captive, until Arthur gives him the crone’s reply: ‘a woman desires to have her will’. Vowing to be revenged against the crone, his sister, he admits that Arthur is right and releases him.
>
> [Arthur returns to court and gathers his knights] They all ride into the forest until they come to the crone. Kay scorns her ugliness, but Gawain cryptically remarks that one of them must marry her. Kay and the other knights refuse, [but Gawain agrees and they all return to court. After the wedding, Gawain and his bride retire to his chamber. She transforms into a beautiful young maiden] and offers him a choice: she can be beautiful during the day or during the night. When he chooses night, she reprimands him, reminding him of their public humiliation. He replies that he was simply testing her, and grants her ‘her will’. Delighted, she promises to be beautiful all the time, informing him that she and her brother were bewitched by their wicked stepmother. [They consummate the marriage, and when Kay comes to check on them in the morning, Gawain relates his wife’s story]. Kay kisses the maiden, praising her beauty, and they all go to Arthur. The whole court welcomes them and they celebrate.
