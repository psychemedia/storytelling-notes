# Stocks and Pillory

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-oxfordshire-36638698
Stocks should not be confused with a pillory - stocks hold the feet and were often used to punish vagabonds and drunkards, whereas a pillory was for the head and hands and for "much more serious crimes", Mr Bretherton added.
The use of the pillory was abolished in England in 1837, but being placed in the stocks is still legal.
The Statute of Labours Act of 1405 required towns to have stocks: https://archive.org/stream/statutesatlarge62britgoog#page/n498/mode/2up ""every town or seignory that faileth of their stocks, so that they be not made before the feast of Easter next coming"

In 1405 a law was passed that required every town and village to have a set of stocks, usually placed by the side of a public highway or village green. Stocks were a status symbol for smaller communities. If a town was too small or could not afford stocks that town was regarded as a hamlet and could not call itself a village. The pillory was only abolished in England around 1837. Stocks were never formally abolished and were used until around 1870.
People who were punished with the use of stocks included traveling musicians, fortune tellers, ballad singers, drunkards, gamblers, revilers, Sabbath breakers, vagrants, wife beaters, unruly servants and petty thieves. Some of the more regular occupants of stocks and pillories were shopkeepers and market stallholders who cheated their customers. For example, giving short change or measure, selling poor quality merchandise. The punishment was often made to fit the crime. A butcher who sold rotten meat would be pilloried with the offending product tied around his neck. An alewife who watered down her beer would have it poured over her head while she sat in the stocks.

The stocks were a mild medieval restraining device for minor offenders
Details :-
They usually consist of two pieces of wood or iron, hinged at one corner with a lock at the other. The two planks have holes cut so that an offenders ankles were locked in place when the stocks are closed.
Use :-
stocks have been used from Anglo-Saxon times until 1837 as a means of punishing minor offences such as drunkenness, resisting a constable or drinking alcohol during church services. The offender was forced to sit with his ankles imprisoned for a specified number of hours as decreed by the magistrate. Unlike the pillory, his hands were free to defend himself from the crowd. In 1405 a law was passed that required every town and village to have a set of stocks, usually placed by the side of a public highway or village green, some examples still exist in the area but are unused.
