https://emadion.it/en/music/diabolus-in-musica-devils-tritone/
Diabolus in Musica (The Devil in Music), also known as Tritone, is a musical interval with a three-tone pause between one note and another. It creates a dissonant sound, a screech that we could compare to a cry, a nocturnal squeaking, a solitary pendulum, depending on the use. For this reason, the Tritone, since the Middle Ages, has earned the reputation of Devil in Music.
It is necessary to remember the role of music in a Church that held the study and diffusion of it. It is not uncommon to read astonishing apotheosis of the art of music by theologians and clergymen. Music, without body and pure harmony, could only refer to God, often more effectively than the doctrine itself.
But if a chord in three parts, such as the Tritone, which only brings to mind the Holy Trinity when it is read, freezed the blood of the listeners, then something was wrong. The superstition spread that the Diabolus in Musica was actually an artifice of the devil, a sort of evil foot against the divine art of composition. Needless to say, the Tritone was branded as a forbidden chord more because of its difficulty – especially in singing – than because of religious warnings.

CHAPTER IV TRANSYLVANIAN-GYPSY STORIES
No. 37. — The Creation of the Violin

In a hut on a mountain, in a fair forest, lived a girl with her four brothers, her father, and her mother. The sister loved a handsome rich huntsman, who often ranged the forest, but who would never speak to the pretty girl. Mara wept day and night, because the handsome man never came near her. She often spoke to him, but he never answered, and went on his way. She sang the song :

'Dear man from a far country,  
Slip your hand into mine ;  
Clasp me, as you will, in your arms ;  
Lovingly will I kiss you.'

She sang it often and often, but he paid no heed. Knowing now no other succour, she called the devil. 'O devil, help me.' The devil came, holding a mirror in his hand, and asked what she wanted. Mara told him her story and bemoaned to him her sorrow. 'If that's all,' said the devil, 'I can help you. I'll give you this. Show it to your beloved, and you'll entice him to you.' Once again came the huntsman to the forest, and Mara had the mirror in her hand and went to meet him. When the huntsman saw himself in the mirror, he cried, "Oh ! that's the devil, that is the devil's doing ; I see myself." And he ran away, and came no more to the forest.

Mara wept now again day and night, for the handsome man never came near her. Knowing now no other succour for her grief, she called again the devil. 'O devil, help me.' The devil came and asked what she wanted. Mara told how the huntsman had run away, when he saw himself in the mirror. The devil laughed and said, 'Let him run, I shall catch him ; like you, he belongs to me. For you both have looked in the mirror, and whoso looks in the mirror is mine. And now I will help you, but you must give me your four brothers, or help you I cannot'. The devil went away and came back at night, when the four brothers slept, and made four strings of them, fiddle-strings — one thicker, then one thinner, the third thinner still, and the thinnest the fourth. Then said the devil, 'Give me also your father.' Mara said, 'Good, I give you my father, only you must help me.' Of the father the devil made a box: that was the fiddle. Then he said, 'Give me also your mother.' Mara answered, ' Good, I give you also my mother, only you must help me.' The devil smiled, and made of the mother a stick, and horsehair of her hair : this was the fiddle-stick. Then the devil played, and Mara rejoiced. But the devil played on and on, and Mara wept. Now laughed the devil and said, 'When your beloved comes, play, and you will entice him to you.' Mara played, and the huntsman heard her playing and came to her. In nine days came the devil and said, 'Worship me, I am your lord.' They would not, and the devil carried them off. The fiddle remained in the forest lying on the ground, and a poor Gypsy came by and saw it. He played, and as he played in thorp and town they laughed and wept just as he chose.

In the *Gypsy Lore Journal* for April 1890, pp. 65-66, Vladislav Komel, Ritter von Zielinski, published a very close Hungarian-Gypsy variant, told to him both at Guta and at Almas. One cannot but be reminded of the ballad of 'Binnorie,' whose story is current in Scotland, Sweden, the Faroe Islands, Iceland, Denmark, Sicily, Poland, Esthonia, and Lithuania, and which Reinhold Kohler has ably discussed in 'Die Ballade von der sprechenden Harfe' (*Aufsätze über Märchen und Volkslieder* pp. 79-98). Campbell's Santal *Folk-tales* pp. 54, 104, furnish two remarkable analogues. In the first a drowned girl grows up as a bamboo, out of which a *jugi* makes a magic fiddle ; in the second a princess, devoured by a monkey, springs up after his death as a gourd, of whose shell a *jugi* makes a wonderful banjo. In both tales there is mention of Doms ; and it is at least an odd coincidence that, while the Gypsy word for devil is *beng*, in Santali a spirit is called *bonga*. Selling one's self, or rather one's blood, to the devil is a superstition still current amongst English Gypsies. I myself knew an elderly East Anglian Gypsy woman, who was supposed to have so sold her blood, and to have got in return a young, good-looking husband, her own nephew, whom she 'kept like a gentleman.' Cf. also pp. 297-9 of my *In Gypsy Tents*.

I.— GYPSY ANECDOTES FROM HUNGARY.
I. — THE FIDDLE. `[The first and second or these tales are extremely close variants of DU Erschaffung der Geige and Die Erschaffung der Welt in Dr. Von Wlisocki's "Marchen und Sagen der Transsilvanischen Zigeuner," Berlin, 1886,]`

(Related to me at Guta, and also at Almas.)

In a small hut on a high mountain, near the edge of a beautiful wood, dwelt a lovely maiden with her parents and four little brothers. The young girl fell in love with a handsome and rich young huntsman, who often visited the forest in pursuit of game. The huntsman, however, rarely noticed her, or spoke to her. Marika became greatly distressed as the young man had not spoken to her for some time, and she wept day and nîght. In order to attract the attention of the hunter, she sang the following song: — 'In the shade of the forest the bird is twittering, — seeking love, flying about without rest or peace : for winter have I no stockîngs, no home ; come, then, beautiful rose, be thou my wife." But the hunter was indifferent, and went past Marika without noticing her. One day, quite despairing, the maiden cried : "Devil; help me !" The Devil appeared holding a small mirror in his hand, and Marika told him her sorrow, and what she desired.

"Oh, that is a trifle," cried the Devil ; "I can help you. Take this mirror, and when your beloved shall have looked into it, he will never leave you."

Some days later, when the hunter went again into the wood, Marika placed herself in his way, holding the mirror towards him. The young man glanced involuntarily into it, exclaiming: "Ah, that is devilry ; I have now seen the Evil One ! " And without saying another Word, he fled into the Valley, and never agaîn visited the forest. Marika was more distressed than ever ; and again she summoned the Devil to her assistance. He soon appeared, and asked the maiden what she desired. When Marika related to him what had happened, the Devil smiled cunningly, saying, "Do not trouble about the hunter, both of you belong to me, as you have both looked into the mirror, and whoever has done so is already my property ; but I will help you notwithstanding, if you give me your four brothers. If you do not do my bidding, I cannot help you." The Devil went his way ; but in the night, when Marika's brothers were asleep, he returned, and made of them four ropes, and out of these ropes four strîngs, a thick one, a thinner one, a still thinner one, and quite a thin one. After having done this, he said to Marika: "Give me thy father !" "Be it so," answered Marika ; "take him, only help me !" The Devil took Marika's father, and transformed him into a box, and made out of this a fiddie. Then the Devil said : "Now, give me thy mother." "Be it so," answered Marika ; "take her, but help me !" The Devil only smiled, and made out of Marika's mother a small stick, and of her hair a long horse-hair. Then he fastened the horse-hair to either end of the little stick, and the fiddlestick was finished. Then the Devil played on the fiddle a tune which greatly pleased Marika; but when he continued playing she commenced crying. The Devil smiled, saying : "When your sweetheart cornes to the wood, play on this fiddie, and he will remain with you." Marika took the fiddie from the Devil and played on it. The hunter heard the melody, and full of joy he hastened to her, and took her away with him.

After the lapse of nine days the Devil appeared, and said ; "Now, come both with me, for I am your master." The loving couple would not obey the command of the Devil, but he seized them and carried them to Hell. On this occasion Marika lost the fiddle in the wood, and a Gypsy who came along found it. Since that time the Gypsy plays so beautifuUy and so sweetly on the fiddie, that in all the towns and villages the people are enchanted, and laugh and cry for joy.

So there was this girl and she was a bit strange.

She was a kind of girl who was always on the edge of things, never in the middle, always lurking about on the edge. That's where she was right now, standing on the edge of her village square staring at this man, not blinking.

Because that is how much she liked him. She liked him a lot. She'd liked him for ages. She thought he was the best man in the village. He had the best hair, objectively. It hung in perfect curls and swirls around his face. He had the best eyes, they gleamed like green glass, the best nose, the best words came out of his face and every time she saw him, her whole body tingled with pleasure.

But the man wasn't bothered. Even though the girl spent quite a lot of her time trying to engineer herself directly into his eyeline, he never saw her. He didn't notice her and so the girl thought I must do something about this dynamic and so she went into the forest because she'd heard that can help and she got on her knees and she tilted her face up to the sky and she chanted those old words, those ancient powerful songs. So as the moon rolls away from its mother and returns, let this man turn to me. So as a pine needle brushes up against another in a pine tree, let this man brush up against me. So as a flower opens its petals to the sun, let this man open himself to me. And then she got up and she went out of the forest to see if it had worked
and it hadn't.

And so she went back in. She got on her knees again and she cried.

She beat her breast with her fists. She sobbed and screamed. She scratched into that forest floor with her nails past the topsoil, past the middle soil, past that dark rich bottom soil deeper and deeper and deeper and oh she got to the devil. All cosy in a little hollow in the ground and the devil looked up and he saw the girl's fingers beckoning and he reached his hands to hers and landed lightly beside her, brushing the earth of his smart black suit, pricking up his horns.

And then the devil looked at the girl and he said, hmm, what do you want?

And the girl looked at the devil and she said, you know what I want.

And the devil said, sure, but what will you do?

And the girl looked at the devil and said, I will do anything.

And then the devil smiled and he said, well, that is music to my ears. Go home and bring me back the thing that gives you the most joy.

And so the girl went home. She went into her house and she looked at all the stuff that was in it, the chairs and the tables and the ornaments, little bits of brick and brack, but none of it really gave her any joy. She thought, why? Why do we have all this stuff if it doesn't bring us joy?

And then she heard this chuckle. And when she turned around, she saw her father, his great broad back and shoulders shaking with mirth, probably laughing at one of his own jokes and she said, father, you give me the most joy. Oh, will you come with me into the forest?

And the father took his daughter's hand and he walked with her through the trees until they got to the devil and the devil smiled and clicked his fingers. And the girl looked at him and said, and the girl's father was gone. All that was left of him were the bones of his torso and just a little bit of his neck. And the devil took those bones and he sculpted them into a hollow box that went in and out and then he varnished it and he polished it.

And the girl said, oh, my father's bones have never shone so bright.

And then the devil said, do you still want this man?

And the girl said, I do. Then go home and bring me the thing that gives you the most strength.

And the girl ran home and as soon as she stepped into the yard of her house, she saw her mother drawing up water from the well. And the girl said, mother, you give me the most strength.

Come with me into the forest. And the mother took her daughter's hand and they ran through the trees towards the devil. He smiled and clicked his fingers. And the girl's mother was gone.

All that was left of her were the bones of her spine and her long gray silvery hair. And the devil took them and he stretched them into a long gleaming bow. And the girl said, oh, my mother's bones have never danced so light.

And the devil looked at the girl and he said, do you still want this man? And the girl said, I do. And go home and bring what gives you the most hope and the most despair.

And she raced home and as soon as she got there, she saw them right away.

Her little brother and sister playing together, pinching and poking each other. And she said, oh, it is you. Definitely. You give me the most hope and the most despair. Come with me into the forest. She took their hands. They ran together. The devil laughed, clicked his fingers twice. And her brother and sister were gone. All that was left of them were their guts and their tongues.

And the devil stretched them as strings over that hollow box of bone. And they tinged and they pinged and the girl said, oh, my brothers and sisters voices have never sounded so sweet.

And then the devil took that strange instrument and he put it underneath the girl's chin.

He put the bow in her hand and he said, now, play. And the girl. Brought the bow down upon the strings and because it doesn't matter who you are or what your violin is made of the first time you try and play, it sounds disgusting.

And the girl said, oh, my brothers and sisters voices have never sounded so sweet.

Because it doesn't matter who you are or what your violin is made of the first time you try and play, it sounds disgusting. But the devil instructed her and say what you like about the devil, and a lot of people do, he is an excellent teacher. And the girl worked, you know, she practiced really hard. She was committed or should have been committed. She rehearsed until the bones in her arms ached, until the tips of her fingers were split with red blood.

She was so focused on what she was doing, she almost forgot what she was doing it for.

And spring became summer, became autumn, became winter, became spring again. And then she was playing so sweet and light that the branches of the trees bent in closer to hear that the birds paused mid song in the air that the butterflies fluttered their wings as quietly as they could so they didn't miss a note. And she took that music out of the forest and into the village.

And when the people heard that sound, you know, full of joy and strength and hope and despair, they left their jobs, they left their kids, they poured out of their houses. And when she played fast, they danced, shaking their limbs loose. And when she played slow, they stood in trance, tears slipping down their cheeks, they threw gold and silver and the clothes off their own backs.

And that man, that man who hadn't noticed her before, he noticed her now. He noticed her all the way home. He noticed her as she wrapped that violin in a silken cloth, put it in a case and fastened the clasp. He noticed her as she walked towards him, gold and silver falling from her hands and said, everything that I have can be yours. My house, my wealth, myself, because I think you are the best man in the village. And then she lifted her lips to his.

But just before they met, she said, but not my violin. Don't touch my violin. And then they kissed. And then they made love. And then they lay together in bed, in each other's arms. And the girl ran her fingers through that man's curling, swirling hair. And she drifted off to dreams, her body tingling with pleasure. But the man couldn't sleep.

You know what it's like when you're in a strange bed, after you've just made love to a strange girl. And so he slipped out of the bed and he walked out of the room and there, lying on the floor, illuminated by a shaft of moonlight from the window, almost like he was doing on purpose, was a violin in his case. Don't touch the violin.

I'm not, thought the man. I'm just looking at the case.

He unfastened the clasp. Don't touch the violin. I am not. I'm merely unfastening the clasps.

He unfolded the silken cloth. Don't touch the violin. I am not. I am just unfolding this silken cloth. He picked up the violin. Okay, yes, I am now in fact touching the violin, but I'm not going to play it because I am not stupid. And he didn't. But he pretended. He struck a pose.

He skimmed the bow in the air above the strings and he imagined those people in front of him, dancing, laughing, weeping, cheering and chanting his name. Oh my God, it was intoxicating.

He could almost hear their voices. Father's bones.

Whispering. Mother's bones. Whispering. Brothers and sisters, guts and tongues.

Whispering. Father's bones. Mother's bones. Brothers and sisters, guts and tongues.

Father's bones. Mother's bones. Brothers and sisters, guts and tongues.

Father's bones. Mother's bones. Brothers and sisters, guts and tongues.

And a drop of blood fell from the bow onto the man's fingers, and another drip fell onto the man's fingers and another drop spilled onto the collar of his shirt and he quickly went and he wrapped the violin back in the cloth, he put it in the case, he fastened the cast and he ran to the bathroom and he scrubbed at the blood on his fingers and he scrubbed at the blood on his shirt but that kind of blood just does not come out even though he scrubbed and he scrubbed until the sun rose the next morning and what are you doing?

The girl stood in the doorway all sleepy and smiley but when she saw the blood staining the man her smile froze as he backed away from her, turning pale and he said you are a monster, you are a murderer, you are the devil's child and the girl said "oh, I'm so sorry that that is how you are choosing to look at it, that is such a shame, do you know what that is really disappointing because I thought you were the best man in the village and you don't understand it all". And the man said "I will tell the village, I will tell everyone who you are and what you have done" and he pushed past her and he ran out of the house and the girl cried.

One tear because that was all she had left in her and then she went and got the violin out of the case, she polished the body, she resined the bow, she tuned the strings and she walked out of her house and she played, sweet and soft to start with you know little notes that just dusted the air and the people stepped out of their houses smiling and then she played smooth round tones that made the people sway on their feet where they stood and then she started playing so fierce and fast and bright her fingers like quicksilver on the strings that the people just stood transfixed in awe until the man turned up, he barged through the people in the village square, he went up to the girl, he grabbed the bow from her hand and the music stopped and the man turned to the people and he told them what he had seen, what he had found out, how the girl had come by that violin and all of the people stared at the man and then all of the people stared at the girl and then all of the people boo, boo.

Boo, boo, boo shut up, get off, we want to hear the music, more, more, more, more and the girl turned to the man and she said oh dear, well now look what you've done, you've upset everyone, what am I going to do with you and then she smiled and she looked just past the man's shoulder and when the man turned he saw that there was another man standing really close to him in a very smart black suit with intense burning eyes and little horns and the girl said "oh yes, now that's a good idea", click.

She bent down and picked up her bow from where it had fallen to the ground, she put the violin back underneath her chin but now just past where her fingers held the neck there was this wooden scroll carved in a perfect curl and she brought the bow back down upon the strings and the music swirled around the people in the village square and they started to move and dance and cheer and chant as the girl played on and the girl played on and the girl played on.

[Based on Sara Liisa Wilkinson telling]

Major elements:


THe first time she saw him, she nw she had to have him.

Girl sees boy (hunter setting up market stall) and must have him.
Can't get his attention (repatedly).

Goes home crying:- mother consoles her (strength)- brother teases (despair)- sister tells her a prince will take her way (hope)- father makes a crap joke that brings a smile to her face even as there are tears in her eyes (joy)

One final try, ignored: walking home through forest, passing the point where two paths crossed — a crossroads — "I would do anything to get him"

"Anything? Even if it were just for one night and one day?"
"Yes".
Bring me the thing that brings you most joy.Father. Returns. Devil clicks fingers. chestbones and neck -> box
Still want boy? Yes. Thing most strength. Mother. Spine and hair - > bow.
Still want boy? Yes. Things that bring you the most hope and despair. Brother and sister. Guts and tongues -> strings

Gave her the instrument: "now you must learn to play this."

Took violin and bow and tried to play it:

> horrible noise, screeching.

Tried again:

> horrible noise, scraping.

If she had thought she would be able to play it from the start, as anyone with a child learning to play the violin will tell you, it doesn't work like that.

> More scratching and scraping.

"You will need to practice", said the devil, "and I will help you..."

And so they practised.

> Maybe: a clean bar (teacher), a noisy bar (learner). 3x, gradual improvement.

After a few weeks the Devil said, now you must go and play in the town each day leading to the next market day.

And she did. THe first day, she felt a bit self conscious, so she furtively played a tune, then scurried away:

> few bars simple tune, eg nursery rhyme

The next day, she was a bit more confident, and a few people smiled as they walked past her.

> few bars simple jig?

The next day, people occasionally stopped;

> few bars reel?

And the next, a small crowd gathered around her:

> few bars hornpipe

By the time market day came around, word had got around about most amazing fiddler, and she was gorgeous with it too..

The young man had heard about her too.

She entered the market square, and people gather around her.

She started quietly and the crowd fell silent too...

> ??

She played some more and they started to tap their feet:

> ?

Some more and they started to sway:

> ?

And then they were dancing:

> ?

And the boy was looking at her, rapt.

She finished playing, packed her violin, and walked through the crowd.

Took boy home; have anything, but don't touch the violin.

Next morning he woke early.

Saw violin, and picked it up.

> (you could perhaps act this? or I could air act it.)

Looked at it. It  certainly was a strange instrument, like nothing he had seen before. Imagined starting to play it. Imagined starting to play it like she played it (air violin) and the crowds roaring and then he heard... he heard the violin: father's bones, mother's bones, brother's and sister's guts and tongues.


??Brother and sister's guts and bones
??Brother and sister's fingers and toes /finger bones

And then: "ow"

He pricked his finger on a splinter. A splinter of... bone? And there was a spot of blood. No, there was more than a spot. There was... there was blood coming out of the strings, out of the bones, there was...

WHAT THE HELL DO YOU THINK YOU ARE DOING?

He looked at her and she looked at him: anger flared and fear responded.

WHat evil is this/
Don't you know what sacrifice I had to make to get you here.  What sacrifice MY FAMILY had to make?

He put the fiddle down ran into town.

She picked it up and followed him.

He was talking, she walked in, crowds gather round.

She started to play:

softly... faster. faster...

At that point the boy pushed through the crowd and grabbed the violin from her.

Told story

Crowd booed. Booed the boy.

The devil at the back smiled. Two souls would have been good, but... one would suffice. 

He clicked his fingers. Boy disappeared and violin fell to ground along with what looked like a.. a small shrunken head. The girl bent down, picked up the violin and the scroll, and added to neck of the instrument.

And the girl played on:

> outtro

And that is the end of the story...

---

The first time she saw him, she knew she had to have him. The young hunter was setting up his stall at the other side of the market square, and she knew, she knew from that very moment, that he was all her heart desired.

She tried to catch his eye, but he was busy arranging the stall, focused intently on his work. She wondered about calling to her family heading homewards ahead that she would catch up, but: it would all have to be very rushed, and what would she possibly have to say to him anyway? The next market day, at the next market day, she would make sure she had plenty of time to go a courting...

The next market-day duly arrived, and several times she walked past the stall, trying to catch his eye.  As his eyes scanned across the market place, it was as if he were looking right through her, not seeing her at all. It was as if she just wasn't there, not a part of his world at all.

And so it went on, from one market day to the next. Once, when she got home, her mother found her sobbing, found her crying, and asked what the matter was. Her father, hearing the upset, looked on in concern. "Unrequieted love..." "Ah", and he made one of his indecipherable jokes that made her smile, even through her tears. Her brother, as brothers are wont to do, teased her remorsely, making her despair; her younger sister told her tales of magic and wonder, tales of hope, where two princes would come to the village and take them both away; and her mother, her mother gave her strength, coming up with a plan for how she could the young man; the next market day, the young girl could buy the meat the family needed, from the young hunter's stall, and make his acquantance that way.

The next market day, the girl went to the stall, let the hunter show her what was particulalry fresh that morning, but despite her smiles, despite her feminine wiles and guiles, it was as if he were more interested in his kill, and his craft, than in her.

Walking home through the forest, she cried out in sorrow, in desperation, in anger. As she came up to the crossroads, she cried out aloud "I would do anything to get him, anything at all".

"Anything?" said a figure, appearing out of the shadows. "Maybe I can help you with that. Would you give anything for him, even if it were for just one night and one day?"

"Even that", she said, looking down, Looking down and noticing that where his boots should have shown beneath his long dark, green coat, were what looked like, not hooves, exactly, but cloven feet. She looked up, started him straight in the eye: "even for that".

"Then I can help you", said the man, said the devil, for who else could it be. "But you will need to do something for me. Go home and bring me back the thing that brings you most joy. Would you do that for a night and a day with this boy? And she thought of the joy that even such a short time would bring her, she was so obsessed with him, and would be sure to be able to keep for more than that given once day and night with him, that she agreed. And as she walked home, she wondered about what was there that brought her most joy...

V. HOW A GYPSY CHEATED THE DEVIL.

(Related to me at Kis-Almas, Aranyos, and ErdÔd-Szada.)

Once, when the Gypsy went into the Csarda (an inn in the pushta), he played on his fiddle such a sad, plaintive, and melancholy tune, that the blades of grass and the bulrushes were covered with tears as with dew. 'Twas thus he sang —

" As a prisoner I am guarded ;  
At my right hand stalks my shadow,  
And my thoughts drag close behind me  
Like some harsh and cruel warder ! "—

pondering the while why he was condemned to poverty, scorn, loathing, and unceasing travel. The strains of the sweet but sad melody sounded far and near, carried on the wings of the playful zephyr, losing themselves among the bulrushes, and makmg an echo that seemed to pîty the Gypsy's lot. The Devil, who lived in an old willow on the banks of a bog, heard this lament, and, seized with compassion for the Gypsy, he resolved to help him. As the Gypsy pursued his way, playing and singing, he saw a Suabian leap out of the dry grass, clothed in a short frockcoat, a pipe in his mouth, and a velvet cap on his head. The Gypsy, astonished to see a stranger so far from the *Csarda* (inn), stopped.

" Eh ! what is the matter ? " said the Devil, surveying him from head to foot; "have I frightened you, that you cease playing and singing ? "

" Ah ! why should I be frightened, Mr. German ? " replied the Gypsy, smiling cunningly as he perceived on his head two horns, which the cap did not cover entirely.

" Very well, but if I were the Devil would you be afraid of me ? "

" Oh," replied the Gypsy, scratching his head, " is the Devil more terrible than a German ? To tell the truth, just now, I would prefer to meet the Devil, as he might help me in my misfortune and my need!"

" Excellent," replied the Devil, " if this is the case, speak. I am he whom you want ; I will help you ! "

" Indeed ! " said the Gypsy ; " for what purpose have you assumed this garb ? If you are really the Devil, you must be aware that every Gypsy and every Hungarian would rather have intercourse with a devil than with a German. Besides it is a matter of indifference to me whether you are a devil or a Suabian — only help me."

" All right," replied the Devil, " but you must give me what is dearest to you!"

" Yes ; but what do I possess that is dearest to me, unless it is this fiddle?"

" That is it," answered the Devil, " you will give me your fiddle ! "

" But what shall I do without it ? "

"You shall be rich ; I will give you heaps of gold."

"Ahem!" said the Gypsy, deep in thought. After a while he replied, smiling unperceived, " And what will you, Mr. Devil, do with the fiddle ? "

" I shall play on it, and everybody will follow me wberever I wish."

" Very well, then, but first carry out your promise ! "

" With pleasure ; but remember that your fiddle belongs to me, otherwise you will fare badly ! Now, bestride this bulrush, as if it were a horse, and follow me."

The Gypsy obeyed the bidding of the Devil, and in one moment both flew through tbe air towards the East.

The Sun was about setting, when the Devil and the Gypsy alighted from their airy steeds, by the Szamos-between-the-Mountains. The Devil took bold of tbe Gypsy's hand, leading him to a waterfall, and took out of the shallow bed of the river a handful of gravel, givîng it to the Gypsy.

" Hère is what I promised. The bottom of this river and the cave behind the waterfall are covered with gold. It is ail yours ; but give me your fiddle."

The Gypsy stared astonished at the gravel, which glittered like gold. After a while, as if distrusting what he saw, he went and took up some gravel and sand ; they were pure gold. " Indeed you have kept your word," said the Gypsy ; " it is now my turn ; only permit me to take leave of my fiddle." And so wonderfuUy did the Gypsy play, that not only the Devil, but heaven also wept.

The Gypsy kissed the fiddle at the last plaintive tone, placed his lips to one of the openinigs, sucked the air out of it, and reached it to the Devil, who disappeared with it like mist.

The Gypsy filled his pipe, lighted it, and commenced taking the gold out of the bed of the Szamos.

After the lapse of three days the Gypsy was very rich, but his longing for his fiddle was still greater. Tired and heartsore, he sat down on one of the heaps of gold, saying, " Devil, thou art clever, but I am not stupid ; I gave thee my fiddle, but not my soul which plays on its strings."

Then suddenly the Devil appeared, and returning the fiddle to the Gypsy, he said, " I have made a bad bargain ; thou hast the gold, but instead of alluriug men with the Sound of thy fiddle, I have frightened them away. Take back therefore thy fiddle, for though I am a devil, I cannot play like thee. But, before parting, how comes it that when thou playest the fiddle sings ao wonderfully ? "

"Well," replied the Gypsy, taking the instrument out of the Devil's hand, "it is but natural. I gave thee the fiddle as promised, but kept the soul for myself !"

And the Gypsy placed his lips to one of the openings of the fiddle, breathed into it, and played such a paasionate csardas, that the Devil skîpped about like one possessed, and the Gypsy himself was greatly astonished at his own playing — he thought he had never played like this.

"Ah; I see now," said the Devil, when the Gypsy had finished playing, " I was a great fool to let myself be cheated by a Gypsy. Thou gavest me the fiddle, but without thy soul. Well, it is done, and cannot be helped ; thou hast my gold and the fîddle, but thy playing will allure men into my net ! "

From that time onwards the devils in hell no longer dance the valse but the csardas. And the Gypsy receives money for the csardas, which he alone can play so wonderfully. And the Devil, though he had been cheated by the Gypsy, lost nothing by it, as men are still flying înto his net the same as before.

TH: could tell this as a fiddler tale.

SSWANDA, THE PIPER.

A BOHEMIAN TALE.

Sswanda, the Piper, was a jolly companion. Like every true musician, he was born with an unquenchable thirst ; be- sides, he was madly fond of play, and would have risked his soul at strajak, the favorite game at cards in Bohemia. When he had earned a little money, he would throw aside his pipes, and drink and play with the first comer till he returned to his home as light in pocket as when he had left it. But he was always so merry, witty, and good-natured that not a drinker ever left the table while the piper was there, and his name still lives in Bohemia as the prince of good fellows.

One day there was a festival at Mokran, and no merry- making was ever complete without the piper. Sswanda, after blowing his pipe till midnight and earning twenty zwanzigers, determined to amuse himself on his own account. Neither prayers nor promises could persuade him to go on with his music ; he was determined to drink his fill and to shuffle the cards at his ease ; but, for the first time in his life, he found no one to play with him.

Sswanda was not the man to quit the inn so long as he had a kreutzer in his pocket, and on that day he had many of them. By dint of talking, laughing, and drinking, he took one of those fixed ideas which are not uncommon among those who look too often in the bottom of their glass, and de- termined to play at any price ; but all his neighbors refused his challenge. Furious at finding no partner, he rose with an unsteady step, paid for what he had drank, and left the inn.

" I will go to Drazic," said he ; " the schoolmaster and the bailiff there are honest peo pie who are not afraid of play, and I shall find part ners. Hurrah !"

The night was clear, and the moon shone like a fish s eye. On reaching a cross road, Sswanda raised his eyes by chance, and stop ped mute and motionless A flock of ravens were croaking over his head, and in front of him rose four posts, standing like pillars, and connected at the top by cross-beams, from each of which swung a half de voured corpse. It was a robbers' gallows, a specta cle by no means amusmg to a less stoical spirit than that of Sswanda.

He had not recovered from the first shudder when suddenly there appeared before him a man dressed in black, with pale and hollow cheeks, and eyes that glittered like carbuncles.

" To Drazic, Mr. Black Coat," answered the intrepid Sswanda.

" Would you like to earn something by your music ?"

" I am tired of blowing,'' returned Sswanda. " I have some silver in my pocket, and wish to amuse myself."

" Who talks to you of silver ? It is with gold that we pay."

Saying this, the stranger flashed before his eyes a handful of shining ducats. The piper was the son of a thrifty moth- er ; he knew not how to resist such an invitation, and followed the black man and his gold.

How the time passed he never could remember. It is true that his head was a little heavy. The only thing that he rec- ollected was that the black man warned him to accept what- ever was offered him, whether gold or wine, but never to re- turn thanks except by saying " Good luck, brother !"

Without knowing how he had entered, he found himself in a dark room where three men, dressed in black like his guide, were playing at strajak by no other light than their glittering eyes. On the table were piles of gold, and a jug from which each one drank in his turn.

" Brothers," said the black man, " I bring you friend Sswan- da, whom you have long known by reputation. I thought to please you on this feast-day by giving you a little music."

" A good idea !" said one of the players. Then, taking the jug, he handed it to Sswanda, saying, " Here, piper, drink and play."

Sswanda had some scruples ; but, after all, it is impossible to have charcoal without putting your fingerp into the ashes. The wine, though rather warm, was not bad. He replaced the jug on the table, and, raising his hat, said, " Good luck, brother !" as he had been advised.

He began to play, and never had his music produced such an effect. Each note made the players leap for joy. Their eyes shot forth flames ; they moved about uneasily in their chairs ; they staked the ducats by handfuls ; they shouted and burst into loud fits of laughter without stirring a muscle of their palhd faces. The jug passed from hand to hand, always full, though replenished by no one.

As soon as Sswanda finished an air, they handed him the jug, from which he never failed to drink deeply, and threw handfuls of gold into his hat. " Good luck, brother !" he repeated, astounded at his fortune — " good luck !"

The feast lasted a long time. At last, the piper having struck up a polka, the black men, in a transport of mirth, quitted the table, and danced and waltzed with an ardor and frenzy which ill accorded with their icy faces. One of the dancers gathered up all the gold that was heaped on the table, and, pouring it into Sswanda's hat, " Here," said he, " take this for the pleasure that you have given us."

" God bless you, my good lords !" said the dazzled piper. Scarcely had he spoken when men, room, and cards vanished.

In the morning a peasant on his way to the fields heard the sound of a pipe as he approached the cross-road. " It is Sswanda," said he. But where was the piper ? Seated on a corner of the gallows, he was blowing with all his might, while the corpses of the robbers danced in the wind to his music.

" Halloo, comrade !" cried the peasant, " how long have you been playing the cuckoo up there ?"

Sswanda started, dropped his pipe, opened his eyes, and glided, bewildered, down the gallows. His first thought, however, was for his ducats. He rummaged Kis pockets, and turned his hat inside out, but all in vain ; there was not even a kreutzer !

" My friend," said the peasant, making the sign of the cross, " God has punished you by giving you the devil for a partner ; you love cards too well."

"Where are you going so late, friend Piper?" asked he, in a soft voice.

" You are right," said Sswanda, trembling ; " I will never touch them again in my life."

He kept his word ; and, to thank Heaven for having preserved him from such peril, he took the fatal pipe to which the devil had danced, and suspended it as a votive offering in the church of Strakonic, his birth-place, where it may be seen to this day. The pipe of Strakonic has become a proverb, and it is even said that its sound is heard every year at the day and hour when Sswanda played for Satan and his friends.
