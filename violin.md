https://emadion.it/en/music/diabolus-in-musica-devils-tritone/
Diabolus in Musica (The Devil in Music), also known as Tritone, is a musical interval with a three-tone pause between one note and another. It creates a dissonant sound, a screech that we could compare to a cry, a nocturnal squeaking, a solitary pendulum, depending on the use. For this reason, the Tritone, since the Middle Ages, has earned the reputation of Devil in Music.
It is necessary to remember the role of music in a Church that held the study and diffusion of it. It is not uncommon to read astonishing apotheosis of the art of music by theologians and clergymen. Music, without body and pure harmony, could only refer to God, often more effectively than the doctrine itself.
But if a chord in three parts, such as the Tritone, which only brings to mind the Holy Trinity when it is read, freezed the blood of the listeners, then something was wrong. The superstition spread that the Diabolus in Musica was actually an artifice of the devil, a sort of evil foot against the divine art of composition. Needless to say, the Tritone was branded as a forbidden chord more because of its difficulty – especially in singing – than because of religious warnings.

So there was this girl and she was a bit strange.

She was a kind of girl who was always on the edge of things, never in the middle, always lurking about on the edge. That's where she was right now, standing on the edge of her village square staring at this man, not blinking.

Because that is how much she liked him. She liked him a lot. She'd liked him for ages. She thought he was the best man in the village. He had the best hair, objectively. It hung in perfect curls and swirls around his face. He had the best eyes, they gleamed like green glass, the best nose, the best words came out of his face and every time she saw him, her whole body tingled with pleasure.

But the man wasn't bothered. Even though the girl spent quite a lot of her time trying to engineer herself directly into his eyeline, he never saw her. He didn't notice her and so the girl thought I must do something about this dynamic and so she went into the forest because she'd heard that can help and she got on her knees and she tilted her face up to the sky and she chanted those old words, those ancient powerful songs. So as the moon rolls away from its mother and returns, let this man turn to me. So as a pine needle brushes up against another in a pine tree, let this man brush up against me. So as a flower opens its petals to the sun, let this man open himself to me. And then she got up and she went out of the forest to see if it had worked
and it hadn't.

And so she went back in. She got on her knees again and she cried.

She beat her breast with her fists. She sobbed and screamed. She scratched into that forest floor with her nails past the topsoil, past the middle soil, past that dark rich bottom soil deeper and deeper and deeper and oh she got to the devil. All cosy in a little hollow in the ground and the devil looked up and he saw the girl's fingers beckoning and he reached his hands to hers and landed lightly beside her, brushing the earth of his smart black suit, pricking up his horns.

And then the devil looked at the girl and he said, hmm, what do you want?

And the girl looked at the devil and she said, you know what I want.

And the devil said, sure, but what will you do?

And the girl looked at the devil and said, I will do anything.

And then the devil smiled and he said, well, that is music to my ears. Go home and bring me back the thing that gives you the most joy.

And so the girl went home. She went into her house and she looked at all the stuff that was in it, the chairs and the tables and the ornaments, little bits of brick and brack, but none of it really gave her any joy. She thought, why? Why do we have all this stuff if it doesn't bring us joy?

And then she heard this chuckle. And when she turned around, she saw her father, his great broad back and shoulders shaking with mirth, probably laughing at one of his own jokes and she said, father, you give me the most joy. Oh, will you come with me into the forest?

And the father took his daughter's hand and he walked with her through the trees until they got to the devil and the devil smiled and clicked his fingers. And the girl looked at him and said, and the girl's father was gone. All that was left of him were the bones of his torso and just a little bit of his neck. And the devil took those bones and he sculpted them into a hollow box that went in and out and then he varnished it and he polished it.

And the girl said, oh, my father's bones have never shone so bright.

And then the devil said, do you still want this man?

And the girl said, I do. Then go home and bring me the thing that gives you the most strength.

And the girl ran home and as soon as she stepped into the yard of her house, she saw her mother drawing up water from the well. And the girl said, mother, you give me the most strength.

Come with me into the forest. And the mother took her daughter's hand and they ran through the trees towards the devil. He smiled and clicked his fingers. And the girl's mother was gone.

All that was left of her were the bones of her spine and her long gray silvery hair. And the devil took them and he stretched them into a long gleaming bow. And the girl said, oh, my mother's bones have never danced so light.

And the devil looked at the girl and he said, do you still want this man? And the girl said, I do. And go home and bring what gives you the most hope and the most despair.

And she raced home and as soon as she got there, she saw them right away.

Her little brother and sister playing together, pinching and poking each other. And she said, oh, it is you. Definitely. You give me the most hope and the most despair. Come with me into the forest. She took their hands. They ran together. The devil laughed, clicked his fingers twice. And her brother and sister were gone. All that was left of them were their guts and their tongues.

And the devil stretched them as strings over that hollow box of bone. And they tinged and they pinged and the girl said, oh, my brothers and sisters voices have never sounded so sweet.

And then the devil took that strange instrument and he put it underneath the girl's chin.

He put the bow in her hand and he said, now, play. And the girl. Brought the bow down upon the strings and because it doesn't matter who you are or what your violin is made of the first time you try and play, it sounds disgusting.

And the girl said, oh, my brothers and sisters voices have never sounded so sweet.

Because it doesn't matter who you are or what your violin is made of the first time you try and play, it sounds disgusting. But the devil instructed her and say what you like about the devil, and a lot of people do, he is an excellent teacher. And the girl worked, you know, she practiced really hard. She was committed or should have been committed. She rehearsed until the bones in her arms ached, until the tips of her fingers were split with red blood.

She was so focused on what she was doing, she almost forgot what she was doing it for.

And spring became summer, became autumn, became winter, became spring again. And then she was playing so sweet and light that the branches of the trees bent in closer to hear that the birds paused mid song in the air that the butterflies fluttered their wings as quietly as they could so they didn't miss a note. And she took that music out of the forest and into the village.

And when the people heard that sound, you know, full of joy and strength and hope and despair, they left their jobs, they left their kids, they poured out of their houses. And when she played fast, they danced, shaking their limbs loose. And when she played slow, they stood in trance, tears slipping down their cheeks, they threw gold and silver and the clothes off their own backs.

And that man, that man who hadn't noticed her before, he noticed her now. He noticed her all the way home. He noticed her as she wrapped that violin in a silken cloth, put it in a case and fastened the clasp. He noticed her as she walked towards him, gold and silver falling from her hands and said, everything that I have can be yours. My house, my wealth, myself, because I think you are the best man in the village. And then she lifted her lips to his.

But just before they met, she said, but not my violin. Don't touch my violin. And then they kissed. And then they made love. And then they lay together in bed, in each other's arms. And the girl ran her fingers through that man's curling, swirling hair. And she drifted off to dreams, her body tingling with pleasure. But the man couldn't sleep.

You know what it's like when you're in a strange bed, after you've just made love to a strange girl. And so he slipped out of the bed and he walked out of the room and there, lying on the floor, illuminated by a shaft of moonlight from the window, almost like he was doing on purpose, was a violin in his case. Don't touch the violin.

I'm not, thought the man. I'm just looking at the case.

He unfastened the clasp. Don't touch the violin. I am not. I'm merely unfastening the clasps.

He unfolded the silken cloth. Don't touch the violin. I am not. I am just unfolding this silken cloth. He picked up the violin. Okay, yes, I am now in fact touching the violin, but I'm not going to play it because I am not stupid. And he didn't. But he pretended. He struck a pose.

He skimmed the bow in the air above the strings and he imagined those people in front of him, dancing, laughing, weeping, cheering and chanting his name. Oh my God, it was intoxicating.

He could almost hear their voices. Father's bones.

Whispering. Mother's bones. Whispering. Brothers and sisters, guts and tongues.

Whispering. Father's bones. Mother's bones. Brothers and sisters, guts and tongues.

Father's bones. Mother's bones. Brothers and sisters, guts and tongues.

Father's bones. Mother's bones. Brothers and sisters, guts and tongues.

And a drop of blood fell from the bow onto the man's fingers, and another drip fell onto the man's fingers and another drop spilled onto the collar of his shirt and he quickly went and he wrapped the violin back in the cloth, he put it in the case, he fastened the cast and he ran to the bathroom and he scrubbed at the blood on his fingers and he scrubbed at the blood on his shirt but that kind of blood just does not come out even though he scrubbed and he scrubbed until the sun rose the next morning and what are you doing?

The girl stood in the doorway all sleepy and smiley but when she saw the blood staining the man her smile froze as he backed away from her, turning pale and he said you are a monster, you are a murderer, you are the devil's child and the girl said "oh, I'm so sorry that that is how you are choosing to look at it, that is such a shame, do you know what that is really disappointing because I thought you were the best man in the village and you don't understand it all". And the man said "I will tell the village, I will tell everyone who you are and what you have done" and he pushed past her and he ran out of the house and the girl cried.

One tear because that was all she had left in her and then she went and got the violin out of the case, she polished the body, she resined the bow, she tuned the strings and she walked out of her house and she played, sweet and soft to start with you know little notes that just dusted the air and the people stepped out of their houses smiling and then she played smooth round tones that made the people sway on their feet where they stood and then she started playing so fierce and fast and bright her fingers like quicksilver on the strings that the people just stood transfixed in awe until the man turned up, he barged through the people in the village square, he went up to the girl, he grabbed the bow from her hand and the music stopped and the man turned to the people and he told them what he had seen, what he had found out, how the girl had come by that violin and all of the people stared at the man and then all of the people stared at the girl and then all of the people boo, boo.

Boo, boo, boo shut up, get off, we want to hear the music, more, more, more, more and the girl turned to the man and she said oh dear, well now look what you've done, you've upset everyone, what am I going to do with you and then she smiled and she looked just past the man's shoulder and when the man turned he saw that there was another man standing really close to him in a very smart black suit with intense burning eyes and little horns and the girl said "oh yes, now that's a good idea", click.

She bent down and picked up her bow from where it had fallen to the ground, she put the violin back underneath her chin but now just past where her fingers held the neck there was this wooden scroll carved in a perfect curl and she brought the bow back down upon the strings and the music swirled around the people in the village square and they started to move and dance and cheer and chant as the girl played on and the girl played on and the girl played on.

[Based on Sara Liisa Wilkinson telling]

Major elements:


THe first time she saw him, she nw she had to have him.

Girl sees boy (hunter setting up market stall) and must have him.
Can't get his attention (repatedly).

Goes home crying:- mother consoles her (strength)- brother teases (despair)- sister tells her a prince will take her way (hope)- father makes a crap joke that brings a smile to her face even as there are tears in her eyes (joy)

One final try, ignored: walking home through forest, passing the point where two paths crossed — a crossroads — "I would do anything to get him"

"Anything? Even if it were just for one night and one day?"
"Yes".
Bring me the thing that brings you most joy.Father. Returns. Devil clicks fingers. chestbones and neck -> box
Still want boy? Yes. Thing most strength. Mother. Spine and hair - > bow.
Still want boy? Yes. Things that bring you the most hope and despair. Brother and sister. Guts and tongues -> strings

Gave her the instrument: "now you must learn to play this."

Took violin and bow and tried to play it:

> horrible noise, screeching.

Tried again:

> horrible noise, scraping.

If she had thought she would be able to play it from the start, as anyone with a child learning to play the violin will tell you, it doesn't work like that.

> More scratching and scraping.

"You will need to practice", said the devil, "and I will help you..."

And so they practised.

> Maybe: a clean bar (teacher), a noisy bar (learner). 3x, gradual improvement.

After a few weeks the Devil said, now you must go and play in the town each day leading to the next market day.

And she did. THe first day, she felt a bit self conscious, so she furtively played a tune, then scurried away:

> few bars simple tune, eg nursery rhyme

The next day, she was a bit more confident, and a few people smiled as they walked past her.

> few bars simple jig?

The next day, people occasionally stopped;

> few bars reel?

And the next, a small crowd gathered around her:

> few bars hornpipe

By the time market day came around, word had got around about most amazing fiddler, and she was gorgeous with it too..

The young man had heard about her too.

She entered the market square, and people gather around her.

She started quietly and the crowd fell silent too...

> ??

She played some more and they started to tap their feet:

> ?

Some more and they started to sway:

> ?

And then they were dancing:

> ?

And the boy was looking at her, rapt.

She finished playing, packed her violin, and walked through the crowd.

Took boy home; have anything, but don't touch the violin.

Next morning he woke early.

Saw violin, and picked it up.

> (you could perhaps act this? or I could air act it.)

Looked at it. It  certainly was a strange instrument, like nothing he had seen before. Imagined starting to play it. Imagined starting to play it like she played it (air violin) and the crowds roaring and then he heard... he heard the violin: father's bones, mother's bones, brother's and sister's guts and tongues.


??Brother and sister's guts and bones
??Brother and sister's fingers and toes /finger bones

And then: "ow"

He pricked his finger on a splinter. A splinter of... bone? And there was a spot of blood. No, there was more than a spot. There was... there was blood coming out of the strings, out of the bones, there was...

WHAT THE HELL DO YOU THINK YOU ARE DOING?

He looked at her and she looked at him: anger flared and fear responded.

WHat evil is this/
Don't you know what sacrifice I had to make to get you here.  What sacrifice MY FAMILY had to make?

He put the fiddle down ran into town.

She picked it up and followed him.

He was talking, she walked in, crowds gather round.

She started to play:

softly... faster. faster...

At that point the boy pushed through the crowd and grabbed the violin from her.

Told story

Crowd booed. Booed the boy.

The devil at the back smiled. Two souls would have been good, but... one would suffice. 

He clicked his fingers. Boy disappeared and violin fell to ground along with what looked like a.. a small shrunken head. The girl bent down, picked up the violin and the scroll, and added to neck of the instrument.

And the girl played on:

> outtro

And that is the end of the story...
