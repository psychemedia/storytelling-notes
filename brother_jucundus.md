# Brother Jucundus

A tale Holly tells - Brother Jucundus


"passed into folklore" because it is too good a story *not* to be a real local legend... A question for me is: where did Sabibne Baring-Gould come by it? Is it something he really collected, and if so, from whom and in what context?

Geography and Travel.
Beautiful Ireland: Connaught and MunSTER, by Stephen Gwynn.—Beautiful England: York, by George Benson ; Chester, by Charles Edwardes. 2/ net each.
To Mr. Gwynn belongs an almost passionate love for the districts he describes—a love which radiates through every page of his two new books, and is especially noticeable in the stories and legends he repeats. The tragedy of Finn and Grania, the history of Daniel O’Connell, the story of St. Brendan’s pilgrimage into the west—all these, as told by Mr. Gwynn, are not merely good reading, but also breathe the very spirit of Ireland. His two books will do what few guide-books can—awaken a strong desire to see the country they depict. The illustrations by Mr. Alexander Williams are uniformly excellent.
Mr. Benson’s book on York has more the character of a guide-book than Mr. Gwynn’s. He gives a good deal of attention to the craft guilds, but says nothing to show wherein they differ from those of other cities. We regret we have not the space to repeat the pleasing medieval story of Brother Jucundus, whose weakness for strong drink all but placed him amongst the saints. There is a strange contrast between this and Mr. Seebohm Rowntree’s book on York as it confronts the social reformer. It is difficult to believe that they deal with the same city.
Mr. Charles Edwardes has written a book about Chester and its environs which is worth reading for its own sake, although it is distinctly the most guide-bookish of the four. Mr. Ernest Haslehust has successfully illustrated the works on York and Chester.
