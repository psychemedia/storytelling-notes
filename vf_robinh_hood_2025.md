Good evening, and welcome to the greenwood, to our set of tales featuring that most daring of outlaws, Robin Hood.

I'm sure many of you will be familiar with some of the tales, with *many* of the tales, of Robin's meeting with Little John, and Friar Tuck, of his various encounters with the Sheriff of Nottingham, and of his love for Maid Marian.

Tonight, our small band of Island Storytellers, and there are more of us, out there, out telling tales throughout the rest of this fantastic Fringe, tonight, we will bring you a range of tales, as well as one of the original ballads â€” for many of the tales of Robin Hood were first recorded in song, rather than story. Some of tales may be familiar, some, perhaps not, or at least, lesser so: tales of how Robin came to be *an outlaw*, and of how he came to be, a *pirate*; of how he claimed a golden arrow, how he faced up against the church, and, finally, how he came to buried where he still lies today.

So sit back, loosen your quivers, rest your bows by your side, and enjoy the show.
