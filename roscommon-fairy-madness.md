Belief in "fairies" is a characteristic feature of the lower classes in Ireland. At Riverstown, County Cork, an old woman named Mary Keefe has been committed for trial charged with obtaining money by false pretences from a poor woman named Murray. The latter had a child seriously ill, and putting her trust in Keefe's boasted powers, the accused obtained money from Mrs. Murray, under the pretence that she had constant communication with the fairies, and through their influence could cure the sick child.

Mysterious Deaths in Ireland.— An Athlone telegram reports the news of a mysterious death which occurred on Friday night or Saturday morning near Lough Funcheon, a remote place in County Roscommon. Deceased is a young man named James Cunningham, son of a prosperous farmer, and the father and three brothers have been taken into custody. It seems that young Cunningham had during the past fortnight exhibited symptoms of mental derangement. He refused to submit to the examination of a medical man whom his friends summoned, and it is stated that on Friday night, during the Lenten devotional exercises, which were being held in the house, a struggle took place. The body of young Cunningham, who was a powerful man, weighing seventeen stone, was discovered by the police severely mangled, while the rest of the family had fled to neighbour's house.

EXORCISING A SPIRIT IN IRELAND

TERRIBLE DOMESTIC TRAGEDY.

A strange affair, apparently possessing affinity with the Tipperary witch-burning case, has occurred in a lonely district about nine miles from Athlone. A young man named James Cunningham, a shoemaker by trade, and living with his father, a respectable farmer, developed a fortnight ago a certain strangeness of manner. He refused, however, to see a medical man, affirming he had more need of a priest, and his family became imbued with the idea that he was possessed by an evil spirit. On Friday night, when everyone was at family prayers, Cunningham, who was a tall, powerful man, suddenly got excited, and, leaping up, seized his father by the throat. Thereupon the other members of the family seemed to have intervened, and a struggle ensued, resulting in the death of Cunningham, whose body, horribly mutilated, was found next morning in the house by the police. The father, three brothers, and a sister, who had during the night sought shelter at a neighbour's, have been arrested.

SHOCKING AFFAIR IN IRELAND.

A remarkable affair, apparently possessing affinity with the Tipperary witch-burning case, has occurred in a lonely district some nine miles from Athlone. A young man named Jas.

The father, three brothers, and a sister, who had during the night sought shelter in a neighbour's, stating they were afraid to remain in their own dwelling, have been arrested. The incident has locally caused a profound sensation.

TERRIBLE TRAGEDY IN ROSCOMMON

A FAMILY GO MAD

DESPERATE MURDER

Athlone, Saturday Night.

A tragedy of a most revolting character, unhappily, in every detail disclosed, and attended with results so distressing in their character as to mark it as one of the most dreadful ever recorded in the County Roscommon, occurred on Friday in the district of Lecarrow, about 12 miles from Athlone, and bordering on Galway and Roscommon. Rumour of the murder reached Athlone about three on Saturday afternoon, and official information was received at the police headquarters shortly after, and Mr St Clair Ruthven and Captain Preston, R. M., immediately proceeded to the place, which is far removed from the railway, and only accessible by car, after some two hours' drive. The house in which the tragedy took place is a substantial one-story building. The kitchen and bedroom are on the first floor, and divided by a thin wall and door, In the bedroom was found the murdered man lying partly on the table, in a dreadful condition. His face was as to be almost unrecognisable. The upper lip and a great portion of the chin were completely smashed. His eyes were protruding, and under them were several severe flesh wounds, while his breast and throat, which were exposed, revealed several long gashes, and his hands were lacerated in numerous places. The other portions of the body did not show further marks of violence. The story associated with this dreadful occurrence is of the most painful character, and absence of motive for the brutal murder renders it all the more inexplicable, except, indeed, the statement that the entire family have been for some days suffering from mental affection. All the persons identified with the tragedy are members of one family (including the murdered man), named Cunningham. They live in a village, or rather hamlet, termed Lesphelan, in which there are in all seven houses, occupied by people of the same name and relatives. They are of the farming class, in a fairly well-to-do condition, and the deceased, James Cunningham, carried on in the house the trade of boot and shoe maker. Nothing unusual was noticed in his demeanour until about a fortnight ago, when the unfortunate man returned from Athlone in a strangely excited state, thus drawing the attention of his father and brothers to him. The police became aware of the fact, and for some days past gave more than customary attention to the district, but relaxed their surveillance within the past week. On Monday last one of the deceased man's brothers called at the Presbytery, and informed the priest of his strange demeanour. He was visited by the curate, and seemed to derive much consolation from his visit, and continued his work during that and the successding days. On Wednesday, however, a relapse set in, and the unfortunate man became entirely demented, and his unhappy state excited the greatest anxiety amongst the entire household, of which he was the principal member — so much so that it is said they too became affected. Dr French, Ballygan, county Galway, whom they previously knew, was sent for, and on his arrival was met by the murdered man, who shook him warmly by the hand, but refused to submit to any medical treatment, stating it was the priest he wanted and not the doctor. The priest was again sent for, and succeeded in pacifying the unfortunate man, who soon afterwards returned to his work, and the family generally seemed much reconciled. On Thursday no unusual occurrence took place, but on Friday deceased left the house, and was seen by several people of the district, including the curate of the parish, with whom he had a conversation shortly before two o'clock, and immediately joined in the Rosary, which was recited in the kitchen. During prayers, however, he suddenly leaped up and, without provocation, fell on his father, whom he attacked violently. A sudden frenzy seemed to instantly take possession of the whole household. From a statement made to the police, it would seem that some of the family rushed with uncontrollable fury at the man, hurried him into the bedroom, and with such weapons as were at hand the terrible tragedy related above took place within a few minutes. The father, mother, and sister then left the house, and proceeded to that of a neighbour, who refused admission to them. They, however, forced the window open. The front door was then opened to them and they were admitted, stating they would not remain in their own house. About 9 a.m. on the following morning, Michael Cunningham went to the police barrack at Lecarron, and informed Sergeant Doyle that his brother was dead. The police immediately accompanied him to the house, where they found the body, the head and shirt covered with blood. The father, brother, and sister then entered the house, which afforded many evidences of the struggle of the previous night, several articles for furniture being broken, and steel implements taken from the murdered man's workshop were scattered about the place. The entire party were placed under arrest and conveyed to the police station. In reply to the questions asked them, the prisoners, who were in the house on Saturday night, said that the family was considered mose industrious, respectable, and very religious. They farm about 50 acres of land, in live stock. It is needless to add occurrence has created the greatest local excitement.

The following are the names of the parties in custody:— Patrick Cunningham (father), John and Michale Cunningham (brothers), Bridget Cunningham (sister).

OCCURRENCE IN COUNTY ROSCOMMON

Alleged Shocking Murder.

A Whole Family Arrested—Affray with the Police.

Roscommon, Saturday.

The country for miles around here was shocked on the news being spread that a supposed family murder of a brutal nature bhd been perpetrated last night at Lisaphelim, six miles from here. It appears that James Cunningham, who was a shoemaker and artificial manure dealer, lived with his father, three brothers, and a sister, in a very comfortable dwelling, and was remarked to be somewhat demented duriug the past week, as was evidenced by his occasional visits to a neighbouring "fort," called "The fairies' fort." The inhabitants of that part of the country are extremely superstitious, and last night a number of them, including James Cunningham, were under the impression that "evil spirits" were hovering round their dwelling. They, having consulted, all retired to their respective homes, but refused to lie down to sleep. The Cunninghams imagined they heard noises in their house, and also sat up, saying they would not retire to bed till the "cock would crow." At about twelve o'clock the whole family knelt down to repeat the Rosary, and during this pious work James, it is stated, jumped up, caught his father by the throat, and threw him to the ground. The members of the family went to the assistance of the old man, but James being a man of extraordinary physique, weighing 17 stone, played havoc with them. The screams attracted the neighbours, and it is stated that several men rushed into the house, when a general *melee* ensued. It is alleged that every instrument in the place was requisitioned to subdue the powerful maniac, who was making such desperate attempts on the lives of the others, and who eventually ran through every portion of the house until he got into room off the kitchen, where it is supposed he was done to death. The family than left the corpse sole occupant, and remained with neighbours till morning, when a brother of deceased reported she matter to the police, who immediately hurried to the house and found the body of James Cunningham lying on the floor, his battered-in head resting against the leg of a table. The police found several instruments with portions of the hair and skin of the deceased attached. The furniture was upset and the general aspect of the house convoyed the impression that a desparate struggle must have ensued. After making inquiries the Constabulary arrested the father, three brothers, and three neighbours on a charge of having murdered James Cunningham.

Athlone, Sunday Night.

The prisoners in the Roscommon murder case— James, Michael, John, Lizzie, and William Cunningham— arrived here this evening, and on their way to the barrack were followed by a large crowd who jeered. The men were handcuffed and tied in the brakes, and presented a frightful appearance. At two o'clock this morning they were under the impression that spirits inhabited the cell in Lecarrow Barracks, sad the five men, being of powerful strength, forced the lock of the gate and charged at the police in the dayroom. There were only six police present— Sergeant Doyle, and Constables O'Brien, Callaghan, Kelly, Dalton, and Duggan — and a fierce struggle ensued between them and the prisoners. Batons were drawn, and after a considerable quantity of blood had been shed the police succeeded in throwing the men, handcuffing then and tying their legs with ropes. In this condition they arrived here this evening, their faces bearing large wounds, while the traces of blood were still visible on them. The father of deceased is so disabled that it was necessary to convey him here in a covered carriage. The female prisoner is suffering much from fright, and was attended by Dr Dobbs. The affair has shocked the whole country side, and all are surprised at the entertainment of the witchcraft idea in their midst. On Friday the deceased sent for the Rev Father Mulleady, P P, St John's, and requested to be annointod; but, seeing the healthy condition of the man, Father Mulleady considered him as labouring under some hallucination. Later on in the day he went to the church, accompanied by his brother, to find the brother Michael, and prayed there for some time. Later information states that the prisoners, including one female, are roaring in the barracks, and it requires a large guard to control them. The coroner, Mr J J Burke, J P, has been wired for to Ballinlough.

THE MAD ROSCOMMON FAMILY.

FURIOUS FIGHT IN THE POLICE CELL.

Athlone, Monday Night.

The shocking tragedy of Lisphelan has developed a new phase. At 1.30 o'clock on Sunday morning the whole family, namely, the father, three sons, and a daughter, who were confined to the lock-up in Lecarrow Potice Barracks, became frantic, and in a moment of ungovernable fury, and while under the hallucination that one of the brothers (Patrick) was the devil, the rest attacked him violently, expressing their determination to deal with him in the same manner as the murdered man. The poor fellow was terribly beaten, and when the police rushed into the lock-up the scene was one of indescribable fury. A fight lasting for an hour and a half ensued, after which time the lock-up was literally covered with blood. The police eventually succeeded in overpowering the prisoners, and then the unfortunate family became more or less pacified. As soon as convenient, the three brothers were tightly strapped and handcuffed, and removed to the police headquarters in Athlone. All Sunday and during the night they were in a very agitated state, and the time passed away in shouting and mumbling prayers "to drive away the fairies."

This morning an inquest was opened at Lisphelan by Mr. Coroner Bourke.

District Inspector Shaw, representing the Divisional Commissioner, on leave, and District Inspector Pearson watched the case on behalf of the Crown.

Mr W. P. Kelly, solicitor, Athlone, was for the next of kin.

Sergeant Doyle, Lecarrow police station, deposed to having heard on Saturday morning from a brother of the deceased of the murder. He came to Lisphelan with some constables and found the body. Patrick Cunningham said the deceased attacked them and they had to do away with him. The kitchen of the house was very much disarranged. There was no live person in the house, but some people came in afterwards. The murdered man was terribly battered, his chin was cut away, his teeth broken, and other injuries apparent on the body. The father said that when they were at the "Rosary" the previous night deceased got up and caught him by the throat. His other sons came to separate them, and the deceased attacked them. They left him dead, and the old man said he heard a voice from the loft say "look out for yourself now."

When brought to the barracks, the accused assaulted the police several times. They were very violent, and could not be worse; they had to tie them with ropes. They were talking about devils and fairies.

Wm. Cunningham, Lesphelan, said the deceased for some time was "innocent." On the night of the murder, after witness, who was a neighbour, had gone to bed, the family of the deceased came to his house, and asked to be let in, for God's sake. He refused, and they burst in the window. They said to him, "Keep up your courage. We have him killed; there is no fear of you. There is no danger now." They ultimately got into his house, and said their own was filled with thousands of deyils; that they were on the loft and outside the door, that only for all the holy water they shook around them they would sweep them all in no time. They then began to say the Rosary and make the sign of the cross. In the morning they went and informed the priest, and would not eater the house until he came.

Bernard Cunninham gave similar evidence.

Drs SHanley and Dobbs gave medical evidence. They said that the nose, jaws, skull and teeth were broken of the murdered man. He had fatty generation of the heart, and death was due to shock caused by the wounds. Deceased must have got terrible treatment.

The jury returned an open verdict.

SUPERSTITION IN ROSCOMMON.

EXTRAORDINARY STATE OF AFFAIRS.

THE BELIEF IN FAIRIES.

The country for miles around Roscommon was shocked on the news being spread that supposed family murder of brutal nature bad been perpetrated as Lisaphelin. It appears that James Cunningham, who was a shoemaker and artificial manure dealer, lived with his father, three brothers, and sister in very comfortable dwelling, and was remarked to be somewhat demented during the past week, as was evidenced by his occasional visits to a neighbouring "fort," called "The Fairies' Fort."

The furniture was upset and the general aspect of the house conveyed the impression that a desperate struggle must have ensued. After making inquiries the Constabulary arrested the father, three brothers, and three neighbours on a charge of having murdered James Cunningham.

An Athlone correspondent says:— The prisoners in the Roscommon murder case—James, Michael, John, Lizzie, and William Cunningham—arrived here this evening, and on their way to the barrack were followed by a large crowd who jeered..

Later information states that the prisoners, including one female, are roaring the barracks, and it requires a large guard to control them. The coroner, J Burke, J P, has been wired for to Ballinlough.

An Athlone correspondent telegraphs that an inquest was held yesterday at Lecarrow by Mr Burke, coroner, county Roscommon on the body of James Cunningham, alleged to have been killed by his father and brothers on Saturday morning. The police evidence showed that the death had been reported by Pat Cunningham, brother of the deceased. He stated that his brother was "a little astray," and had to be done away with. The condition of the body showed several wounds on the face, evidently inflicted by a sharp instrument. The father told the police that the deceased had seized him by the throat, and in effecting his rescue, other sons had beaten James severely with their fists. During the struggle a mysterious voice was heard calling from a neighbouring loft, "Now, take care of yourself." In custody Cunningham had kept up shouting ptayers and incantations. William Cunningham, a neighbour, deposed that the prisoners had burst open his door, and stated they were going to stay all night. They had killed him (meaning deceased), and had had a narrow escape; their house was filled with devils and fairies whom they felt cracking the door, and had to hunt them with holy water. The Cunninghams weie sober, industrious people. The jury found that the deceased was killed by his father and brothers in self-defence.

ATHLONE MURDER.

TERRIBLE SCENE IN TULLAMORE GAOL.

DEMONIAC FRENZY OF THE PRISONERS.

Tuilamore Gaol, in which the four men named Cunningham are confined in connection with the murder near Athlone, on Wednesday night witnessed a terrible scene. The men became seized with frenzy, and their shrieks resounded through the building. They also dashed themselves about the cells, uttering wild adjurations to be delivered from the fairies and devils surrounding them. A large staff of warders was summoned, and the prison surgeon had to be sent for. On entering one of the cells the doctor was violently attacked, and was only rescued with difficulty. All the prisoners had ultimately to be strapped down, but they continued to vociferate with unabated violence. The paroxysm lasted through the night, and the surgeon had to call in outside medical assistance. There appears to be no doubt that three of the prisoners are violent maniacs, and the action of the Athlone magistrates in sending them to gaol instead of to a lunatic asylum is regarded as extraordinary.

THE CUNNINGHAM FAMILY.

A Tullomore correspondent telegraphs that Dr. Stewart Woodhonse, Medical-officer of the Prisons Board, together with Dr. Kennedy, gaol surgeon, and Dr. Moorhead, on Saturday visited the Cunningham family, who are charged with the murder of a relation whom they alleged was "possessed of fairies," and as a result one of the accused was pronounced to be a dangerous lunatic, and was removed to Maryborough Lunatic Asylum. The other prisoners, the father and two sons, are improving in health, although the sons particularly are physically weak and prostrate, and it will be some time before they will be fit to undergo a magisterial examination.

Reynolds's Newspaper - Sunday 19 April 1896

*Widely syndicated, also under the heading "Supposed Murder by Maniacs".*

THE ATHLONE TRAGEDY.

At Athlone on Wednesday Patrick Cnnningham and his sons, Patrick and John, were charged with the murder of James Cunningham. The accused have been confined for some weeks in Tullamore Gaol, being mentally unfit to plead. Two other members of the family have been committed to a lunatic asylum. Evidence was given to the effect that Patrick Cunningham, jun., went to the Lecarrow Police Station and told Sergeant Doyle that they had had to do away with James, who attacked his father. The body of James was found at the house on a table. The side of the head was battered in, and there was a stream of blood under the table. Patrick Cunningham, sen., made a statement to the effect that the family were saying prayers, when a gust of smoke came through the door, whereupon the deceased got excited, and caught him (the father) by the throat. The other sons beat the deceased and left him in the house. All then ran out to William Cunningham's house. Sergeant Doyle stated that when in the cells the prisoners behaved in an extraordinary manner. They shouted and prayed, and seemed in terror of something. A Constable stated that the prisoners were very violent in the cells. They were "spitting to keep off the fairies" and shouted "Daylight" during their prayers. William Cunningham stated that on the night of James's death his father and three brothers and sister forced their way into his house, and said their home was full of spirits. They were only partially dressed. Evidence having been given to the effect that the accused were suffering from delirious religious mania, they were committed for trial, bail being refused.
