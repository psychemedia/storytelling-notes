# Plates & Shakers

Possible ticketing model:

£10 (or £12, or £15) as a flat entry price and then discounted (with the ticket) special cocktails / plates that fit the tales, on the event night. If the special cocktails are "limited edition" and a £1 more than normal, the discount could be £3 off. Pricing to make folk think they are paying for the show but also getting some drinks discounted.

Advance promotion: cocktails could be offered as a "one night only" limited edition cocktail prior the event as a tease.

Loyalty show - ticket via special priced limited edition cocktails sold in advance, and you need to buy at least two over two separate nights to qualify for a ticket.
