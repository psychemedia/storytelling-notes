## Welsh Gypsy Folk Tales

*I'm a bit wary pulling this collection together, even though it would make for an excellent set of story notes, in part because of the "prior claim" that Daniel Morden could argue to have over it. For example, his book "Dark Tales from the Woods" retells several of these stories, and at least one of his workshops (on story structure, a workshop I have attended) critiques how his version of one of the tales was transformed from the original. That said, my better half has a family line descended from two Welsh gipsy families, the Woods and the Prices...*

No. 63.— The Black Lady

A young girl goes to service at an old castle with the Black Lady, who warns her not to look through the window. The Black Lady goes out. The girl gets bored, looks through the window, and sees the Black Lady playing cards with the devil. She falls down frightened. The Black Lady comes in and asks her what she has seen. 'Nothing saw I; nought can I say. Leave me alone; I am weary of my life.' The Black Lady beats her, and asks her again, 'What saw you through the window?' 'Nothing saw I,' etc. The girl runs off and meets a keeper, who takes her home, and after some years marries her. She has a child, and is bedded. Enter the Black Lady. ' What saw you through the window ? ' ' Nothing saw I,' etc. The Black Lady takes the child, dashes its brains out, and exit. Enter the husband. The wife offers no explanation, and the husband wants to burn her, but his mother intercedes and saves her this time. But the same thing happens again, and the husband makes a fire. As she is being brought to the stake, the Black Lady comes. ' What saw you through the window?' 'Nothing saw I,' etc. 'Take her and burn her,' says the Black Lady. They fasten her up, and bring a light. The same question, the same answer. The Black Lady sees that she is secret, so gives her back her two children, and leaves her in peace.

`A story of the 'Forbidden Room' type (cf. Clouston, i. 198-205 [Popular Tales and Fictions,). An incomplete Italian variant is cited there ; much closer parallels are Grimm's No. 3, 'Our Lady's Child'(i. 7 and 341), and Dasent's 'The Lassie and her Godmother' (p. 198; [?p216 of "Popular Tales from the Norse", 1859; p213 of "A selection from the Norse tales for the use of children", 1862]). For playing cards with the devil, see p. 120 ; and cf. also this passage from the Roumanian-Gypsy story of 'The Vampire' (No. 5, p. 18):—“'Tell me what did you see me doing ? ” “I saw nothing.” And he killed her boy.'`

The Black Lady.

There once was a young girl who wanted a place to do work. She got a placo at the old castle.

She who lived in the castle was the old Black Lady. She showed the girl all that was in the house, and warned her on her life not to look through the 
window. And after she had shown her everything the Black Lady went away.

The young girl was alone. There was nothing for her to do in the house: she read the books on the table. Then came into her head what the old Black Lady had said to her about the window. Up she got on her feet, and took a little chair. She went to the window and looked through it. She saw the Black Lady and the Devil playing cards. Down fell the young girl terrified.

The Black Lady rose, opened the door, and came out She asked her: 'What didst thou see in the room ?'

'I saw nothing. Let me alone. I am tired of my life.'

The Black Lady beat her, and asked her again. 

' I saw nothing. I will say nothing. I am tired of my life.'

The Black Lady went away, and the young woman went out, and with nothing on her head wandered through the trees. She was weary. She sat down. Presently there came a man riding upcm horseback, he was a keeper. He asked her where she was going. She told him all the Blaok Lady had done to her.

'Get up,' said the man. 'Come hehind me upon the horse's back!'

The young woman did so, and they went to his mother's house. The man told his mother that ho had found the young woman sitting down.  The old woman led her into the house. She made her the servant. She was a handsome young woman.

Now she had been there years. And the young man wanted to court her. He told his mother that he loved her. The keeper took her as his wife. She had a child. And she lay abed. Now comes the Black Lady. 'What didst thou see through the window?'

'I saw nothing. I will say nothing. Let me alone. I am tired of my life.'

The Black Lady took the child and battered his head to pieces againat the hearthstone. The Black Lady went away.

Now the keeper comes home. He goes to her to look for the child. No child could he see in the bed. He asked her where the child was. The young woman made no answer. The man went away and made a great fire and was going to burn her.

The mother came to her son to beg of him that he would not burn her. She had a great to-do with him. The son left her swearing to his mother: 'If it should be thus again, I burn her.'

In the next year she had a child. The Black Lady came in to her. ' What didst thou see through the window ? '

'I saw nothing. I will say nothing. Let me alone. I am tired of my life.'

She took the child and dashed him upon the hearthstone.

Presently the husband came to look for her. He came in; he saw no child there; he saw the blood on the stone.

'Thou didst kill the child, didst thou?'

The man departed in anger. He went out and he made a great fire to burn her. He went into the place, and carried her down. When he was about to put her on the fire, lo! the Black Lady comes.

She aaked : ' What didst thou see through the window ? '

'I saw nothing. I will say nothing. Let me alona I am tired of my life.'

'Put her on the fire,' said the Lady.

As she came near the fire, ' Stop!' said the Black Lady. Bring the woman back. What didst thou see through the window ? '

' I saw nothing. I will say nothing. I am tired of my life.'

The Black Lady saw that she would not tell.

' Here are thy two children. And never again will I speak to thee, neither shalt thou see me more.'

The husband and wife live a together, and the two children live happily.

There is no more ! Good night to thee !
