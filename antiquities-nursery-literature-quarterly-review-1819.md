UNDER HEADING: Antiquities of Nursery Literature

Art. V.—Fairy Tales, or the Lilliputian Cabinet, containing Twenty-four choice pieces of Fancy and Fiction, collected by Benjamin Tabart. Tabart & Co. fy 1818.

GENCE our boyish days the literature of the nursery has sustained

a mighty alteration: the tone of the reading public has infected the taste of the spelling public. Mr. Benjamin Tabart's collection is, as we understand, considered an acceptable present to the rising generation; yet, though it is by na means devoid of merit, it recals but faintly the pleasant homeliness of the narrations which used to delight us in those happy times when we were still pinned to our nurse's apron-strings, and which are now thought too childish to deserve a we even in the tiny library of the baby. Even Nurse herself has become strangely fastidious im her taste, and the books which please her are far different from those over which she used to pore, when she put on ber spectacles, and took such desperate

books which were formerly suld to the country people at fairs and

markets have been able to maintain their ancient popularity; and we have almost witnessed the extinction of this branch of our national literature. Spruce modern novels, and degenerate modern

Gothic romances, romances only in name, have expelled the ancient 'histories' evew from their last retreats. The kitchen wench,

who thumbs the Mysteries of Udolpho, or the Rose of Raby, won'¢ grieve at all for the death of Fair Rosamond: and the tale of Troy, which, in the days of good Queen Bess, Would mollify the hearts of barb'rous people, And make Tom Butcher weep,

Gulley, the Champion of England, has supplanted St. George; and since Molineux and Dutch Sam and Scroggins have shewn fight, there is not a shepherd's boy who cares a straw for the prowess of the Nine Grim Worthies of the World, whether Gentile, Jew or Christian. Politics and sectarianism complete the change which has taken place in the contents of the budget of the flying stationer. The old broadside-ballads have given way to the red stamp of the newspaper; and pedlers burn their ungodly story-books like sorcerers of old, and fill their baskets with the productions sanctified by the Imprimatur of the Tabernacle. As for the much lamented Mr. Marshall, now no longer of Aldermary Church-yard, whose cheap and splendid publications at once excited and rewarded our youthful industry, he hath been compelled to shut up his shop long ago. Not a soul im the trade would bid for the copy-right and back stock of Tommy Two Shoes. His penny books are out of print, one and all, and therefore, if things continue to go onas they have done of late years, there is really no telling what sums of money a good copy of the genuine edition of the Lifeand Death of Cock Robin may not soon fetch under the hammer of Mr. Evans, especially if it should chance to be a 'tall copy,' with 'uncut margins,' graced with 'clear impressions' of the 'numerous wood cuts,' and retaining its 'original' gilt paper binding.; Physiologists investigate the laws of animated life in the animalcules swimming in the rain-drop. The botanist ascends from mosses and lichens to. the oak tree and palm. The man of letters should not disdain the chap book, or the nursery story. Humble as these efforts of the human intellect may appear, they shew its secret workings, its mode and progress, and human nature must be studied in all its productions: And we shall observe, in the words of Walter Scott, 'that a work of great interest might be compiled upon the origin of popular fiction and the transmission of similar tales from age to age and from country to country. The mythology of one period would then appear to pass into the romance of the next century, and that into the nursery tale of the subsequent ages.' Fiction thus resolves itself into its primitive elements, as by the slow and unceasing action of the rain and wind the solid granite is crumbled into sand. 'The creations embodied by the vivid imagy nation of man in the childhood of his race, incorporate themselves in his fond and mistaken faith. Sanctity is given to his day-dreams by the altar of the idol, 'Fhen, perhaps, they acquire a deceitful truth

ruth from the genius of the bard. - Blended with the mortal hero, the aspect of the god gleams through the vizor of the helmet, of adds a holy dignity to the regal erown. Poetry borrows its ornaments from the lessons of the priest. The ancient God of strength of the Teutons, throned in his chariot of the stars, the northern wain,* invested: the Emperor-of the Franks and the Paladins who surrounded him with superhuman might. And the same constellation darting down its rays upon the head of the long lost+ Arthur has given to the monarch of the Britons the veneration which once bea to the son of 'Uthry Bendragon,' 'Thunder the Supreme

, and 'Eygyr the generating power.' But time rolls on: faith lessens, the flocks are led to graze within the rocky circle of the giants. Even the bones of the warriors moulder into dust; the lay is no longer heard; and the fable, reduced again to its original simplicity and nudity, becomes the fitting source of pastime to the untutored peasant and the listening child.

Hence we may yet trace no small proportion of mystic and romantic lore in the tales which gladden the cottage fireside, or, century after century, sooth the infant to its slumbers. When the nursery-maid looks for her sweetheart in the bottom of the tea-cup she is little aware that she is practising the scyphomancy of the Egyptians, We must not now, however, allow ourselves to wander from the realms of popular fiction to the land of popular superstition, although there is so.much difficulty in ascertaining their proper boundaries that forgiveness might be readily obtained for the digression. The elves which dance on the wold must be considered as subject to the same laws as the fairies who bless the young prince's christening cap; and the giant who fills up the portal of the castle, or who wields his club upon the roof of the tower, does not differ essentially from the tall black man who carries away the naughty boy, and terrifies. the little ruddy-cheeked. maiden on the maternal bosom. 'These man-eaters were generally the great captains of the times.  Beware of Melendo! was the threat of the Moorish mother to her babe.' The Moors were driven from An-

Arthur, according to Mr, Owen, is a mythological personage. 'Arthur,' he says, is the Great Bear, as the name actually implies: (it is odd he did not think of Arctos and Arcturus to strengthen his hypothesis.) 'And perhaps this constellation, being so near the pole, and sensibly describing a circle in so stall a space, is the origin of the round. table.', 's. Preface to the History of Arthur, p. 3.

Some of them are extant in manuscript, others live only in the traditions of the common people. A translation of the former was prepared for the press by Mr, William Owen, to whom Cymric literature is so greatly indebted, but the manuscript was unfortunately lost before publication. These tales possess extraordinary singularity and interest, and a complete collection of them in the original. language is, as Mr, Southey remarks, a desideratum in British literature. The Cymry however seem to have little feelmg for the productions of their ancestors; and the praiseworthy and patriotic exertions of individuals may cause the Welch nation at large to blush. When a foreigner asks us the names of the nobility and gentry of the principality who published the Myvyrian Archeology at their own expense, we must answer that it was none of them, but Owen Jones, the Thames-street furrier.

The popular fiction of the Celts is lively in its poetical dinagery. Amongst the nations where the blood of the Teutons yet predominates, popular fiction is equally poetical in its cast. Not so in the happier climes of the south of Europe, where the Italian gives a sest to his popular narratives by buffoonery or ribaldry. A-considerable portion of the fairy tales contained in the 'Peatamerone, overo Trattenemiento de li Piccerille;' or 'Entertainment for the Little Ones,' together with those from the Nights of Signor Straparola, exhibit the inhabitants of Peristan as their chief characters, though not always retaining their eastern grace and beauty. Giovan' Battista Basile, who published his work under the fictitious name of Gian Alesso Abbatutis, compiled the Pentamerene* from the old stories current amongst the Neapolitans, and the work is written wholly in his native Neapolitan dialect, a language, uot a jargon as it is absurdly called by the Tuscans, which was cultivated at a much earlier period than the volgar' illustre of Tuscany. The narative which connects the stories is invented by the Cavaliér Basile himself; the tales are told with characteristic oddity by the. ten old women of the city, whose tongues run most libly, to witZoza Scioffata, Cecca Storta, Meneca Vozzolosa, To Nasuta, Popa Scartellata, Antonella Vavosa, Ciulla Mossuta, Sgargista,

have taken considerable pains, and often with considerable success, to shew the relationship between these 'Kinder Marchen,' or Children's Tales, and the venerable Sagas of the North, which, in good 'sooth, were only intended for children of larger growth. 'The real worth of these tales,' continue Messrs. Grimm, 'is indeed to be highly estimated, as they give a new and more complete elucidation of our.ancient German heroic fictions than could be obtained from any other source. Thornrosa, who is set a sleeping in consequence of the wounds inflicted by her spindle, is Brynhilda cast into slumber by the sleep-thorn of Odin. The manner in which Loke hangs to the giant-eagle is better understood after a perusal of the story of the Golden Goose, to which the lads and lasses who touch it, adhere inseparably. In the stories of the Wicked Goldsmith, the Speaking Bird, and the Eating of the Bird's Heart, who does not recognize the fable of Sigurd ?* ~ In these popular stories is concealed the pure and primitive mythology of the Teutons which has been considered as lost for ever; and we are convinced that if such researches are continued in the different districts of Germany, the traditions of this nature, which are now neglected, will change into treasuries of incredible worth, and assist in affording a new basis for the study of the origin of our ancient poetical fictions.'— Kindermarchen, vol. ii. p. 7.

Messrs. Grimm are .ardent and enthusiastic. Our lamented Leyden, who took an analogous view of popular narrative, was rather inclined to connect its history with ancient romance, as he overlooked the mythological basis of the 'system.' In the repetition of an unskilful reciter the metrical romance or fabliau seems often to have degenerated into a popular story; and it is a curious fact that the subjects of some of the stories which I have heard repeated in Scotland, do not essentially from those of some of the ancient Norman fabliaux, presented to the public in an form by Le Grand. Thus whew I first perused the fabliaux of the Poor Scholar, the Three Thieves, and the Sexton of Cluni, I was surprised to recognize the 'stories which

1 had often heard repeated in infancy, and which [ had often repeated myself when the song or the tale repeated by turns, amused the tedious evenings of winter. From. this circumstance I am. inclined to think that many of the Scottish popular stories may have been common to the, Norman French: hether these tales be derived immediately from the French during their long and intimate intercourse with the Scotch nation, or whether both nations borrowed them from the Celtic, may admit of some doubt.'

In ascribing a common origin to the popular fictions of our island and the continent we cannot be far from the truth; but since the people of England and the Scottish Lowlands are undoubtedly offsets and grafts from the Teutonic stock, it is probable that our popular fables also are chiefly of Teutonic origin. These idle stories boast a higher aytiquity than romances and poems of much greater pretensions. Our proud baronial families-can trace their line only up to Battle Abbey-Roll, whilst the yeomen. and franklins of Essex and Sussex, and Kent, the Spongs and-the Pungs, and the Wapshotts and the Eppses, bear in.their names the evidence of their de~ scent from the Saxon and Danish rors of Britain: and even peng of. the romances of the Table in their present

Jack, commonly called the Giant Killer, and Thomas Thumb landed, in England from the very. same keels and warships which conveyed Hengist and Horsa,and Ebba the Saxon,

To begin with the.rudest species of these inventions, we may notice the nursery tale heard by Dr, Leyden, and reported by him to be 'very similar, in many respects, to the "Grim white woman" of Mr. Lewis, in which the-spirit of a child in the form of a bird is supposed to whistle the following verse to its father:

'—— Pew-wew—pew-wew, My minny mé slew.'

It would occupy too much room to abstract the tale of the 'Machandel Boom,' or the Holly Tree, which was substantially the same; but the Nether-Saxon stanza, corresponding with the Scottish verse, may be given for the sake of comparison.;

'Min Moder de mi slacht't, Min Vader de 'mi att, Min Swester de Marleeniken, Sdcht alle mine Beeniken Un bind't se in een siden, Dook Legt's unner den Machandel boom _ . *: Kyoitt! Kyoitt! ach wat een schin vogel bin ick.'

Our Scottish friends will not be displeased at our offering them» another proof of the antiquity of their popular fictions. Dr. Leyden 'recollected to have heard a story, wherein a spirit gives the following injunction to a terrified ghost seer;' which, by the way, has settled the important doubts respecting the gender of a gib cat.

. * Mader Watt! Mader Watt!

Tell your gib cat Auld Girniegae o' Cragend's dead.'

The same story is told in Denmark as having occurred at a town called Lyng, near Soroe. Not far distant from this village is a hill, called 'Brondhoé,' which is inhabited by the Troldfok—e set of beings somewhat between men and devils, though more akin to the latter. Amongst these Trolds was an old sickly devil, peevish and ill-tempered, because he was married to a young wife: this unhappy Trold often set the rest by the ears, whence they nick-named him 'Knurre-Murre,' or Rumble Grumble. Now, it came to pass that Knurre-Murre discovered that his young wife was inclined to honour him with a supplemental pair of horns; and, to avoid Knurre-Murre's vengeance, the amorous Trold who excited his jealousy was forced to fly for his life from the cairn, and take refuge, in the shape of a tortoise-shell cat, in the house of Goodman Platt; who harboured him with much hospitality, let him lie on the great wicker chair, and fed him twice a day with bread and milk out of a red earthenware pipkin. One evening the goodman came home, at a late hour, full of wonderment—' Goody,' exclaimed he to his wife, 'as I was passing by Brondhoé, there came out a Trold, who spake to me, saying—

"Hor du Plat, Siig til din kat At Knourre-Murre er déd."

Hear thou Platt, Say to thy cat That Knurre-Murre is dead,

The tortoise-shell cat was lying on the great wicker chair and eating his supper of bread and milk out of the red earthenware pipKin when the Goodman came in; but as soon as the message was delivered he jumped bolt upright upon his two hind legs, for all the world like a Christian, and kicking the red earthenware pipkin and the rest of the bread and milk before him, he whisked through the cottage door, mewing "What! is Knurre Murre dead! then I may go home again"

The tale of the frog-lover, given by Dr. Leyden, and popular in Seotland, is known im every part of Germany under the name of 'the King of the Frogs,' and is alluded to in several ancient German writers. The rhythmical address of the aquatic lover,

who

who is, of course, an enchanted prince, corresponds in the two languages. * Open the door, my hinny, my heart, Open the door mine ane wee thing, And mind the words that you and I spak Down in the meadow at the well spring.'

* Konigstochter, jungste Mach mir auf Weiss du nicht was gestern Du zu mir gesagt Bei dem Kiihlen Brunnenwasser Konigstochter jungste Mach mir auf.'

These enchanted frogs have migrated from afar, and we suspect that they were originally crocodiles; we trace them in a tale forming part of a series of stories entitled 'The Relations of Ssidi Kur, extant amongst the Calmuck Tartars. It appears that the * adventures which befel the wandering Chan' were originally written in Thibet, and the author commences with an invocation to one of the lesser gods of Lamaism. 'Glorified Naugasuna Garbi! thou art radiant within and without!—the holy vessel of existence, the second of our instructors, I bow before thee.' The tales of witchery learnt from the wonderful bird Ssidi are singularly wild and strange, and the scene of the romance is placed in the middle kingdom of India. All the magical machinery of the popular tales of Europe is to be found in these tales, which have a genuine Tartar character + there are wishing-caps and flying swords, and hobgoblins and fairies in abundance. Ssidi also tells a story of a benevolent Bramin, who receives the grateful assistance of a mouse, a bear, and a monkey, whom he had severally rescued from the hands of their tormentors. A fable founded on nearly the same plot is given in the Gesta Romanorum, though the details differ widely; Calila and Dimnah furnish others of the same class: but we consider it as an extraordinary fact, that a fable precisely of the same import is yet a favourite amongst the peasantry in the Schwalmgegend, (somewhere in. Hesse,) where, as Messrs. Grimm inform us, it has been preserved by tradition: they do not seem to be aware of its Tartar orig. It will be shewn below that even Jack the Giant Killer is under some obligation to the fictions of the Calmucks, We learn from Mr. Morier's entertaining narrative that Whittington's cat realized his price in India; the story rested in Italy by the way, and the merry priest, Arlotto, told it before the Lord Mayor was born or thought of.* These circumstances, trifling as the subject may ap-

pear,

pear, will lend their aid in tracing the fictions of the inhabitants of Europe from the first seat of the Caucasian tribes.

Whittington, however, will claim: less attention than Tom Tuoums andTom Hicxarurirr. The learned Doctor William Wagstaffe, Physician to St. Bartholomew's Hospital, Fellow of the College of Physicians and of the Royal Society, and whose name was so analogous to his humour, hath given a very strong 'testimony' respecting the merits of these histories, which, according to the good old custom of classical editors, we intend to prefix to our proposed critical edition of these works 'cum notis variorum.' The Doctor says' that the lives in question are more proper to adorn the shelves of Bodley or the Vatican, than to be confined in the retirement and obscurity of a private library. I have perused the former of them (he adds) with more than ordinary apjeune and have made some observations on it which will not,

hope, prove unacceptable to the public.' He has confined himself, however, to the poetical beauties of the work; we hope therefore it will be equally 'acceptable to the public' if we attempt to contribute our mite towards its literary history.

Tom Hearne* would almost have sworn that Tom Thumb the fairy knight was 'King Edgar's page.' On ballad authority we learn that 'Tom a lyn was a Scottsman born." Now Tom Hearne and the ballad are both in the wrong; for Tom a lin, otherwise Tamlane, is no other than Tom Thumb himself, who was originally a dwarf, or dwergar, of Scandinavian descent, being the Thaumlin, i. e. Little Thumb of the Northmen. Drayton, who introduces both these heroes in his Nymphidia, seems to have suspected their identity.

The German 'Daumerling,' i. e. little Thumb, is degraded to the son of a taylor;—he has not much in common with Tom Thumb the Great, except the misfortune of being swallowed by the dun cow, which took place in Germany just as it did in England.+ This isa traditionary story of the Germans: but there

* See Hearne's Benedictus Abbas, p. 54.

t 'Many years ago,' (a literary friend writes to us,) 'I had persuaded myself that several of our common nursery odes were the remnants of antient sve, and that Tom Thumb, for instance, if the truth should be discovered, would be found to be a mythological personage. Though fully convinced at the time that so strange a fiction could not have arisen from any other source, I had not the least expectation that any thing would ever occur to me in confirmation of such an apparent paradox. Tom Thumb's adventure bears a near analogy to the rite of adoption into the Braminical order, a ceremony which still exists in India, and to which the Rajah of Tanjore submitted not many years ago. In Dubois work there is an account of a diminutive deity, whose person and character are analogous to that of Tom Thumb, He too, if I recollec

s a little book in the Danish language, analyzed by Professor Nierup, of the University of Copenhagen, who- censures it, and thaps with some degree of justice, as a 'very childish history.' t treats of 'Swain Tomling', a man no bigger than a thumb, who would be married to a woman three ells and three quarters tong.' The Danish title-page, which we transcribe below,* enumerates other of Tomling's adventures which are not found in the ¢ History of his Marvellous Acts of Manhood,' as preserved in England; the manhood, however, which emboldened the Swain to veuture on a wife of 'three ells and three quarters' in length is yet commemorated in the ancient rhyme which begins 'I had a little husband no bigger than my thumb.'

According to popular tradition Tom Thumb died at Lincoln, which it may be recollected was one of the five Danish towns of England; we do not, however, therefore intend to insist that the story was handed down by the northern invaders. There was a little blue flag-stone in the pavement of the Minster which was shewn as Tom Thumb's monument, and the country folks never failed to marvel at it when they came to church on the Assize Sunday; but during some of the modern repairs which have been inflicted on that venerable building, the flag-stone was displaced and lost, to the great discomfiture of the holiday visitants.

The prose history of Tom Thumb is manufactured from the ballad; and by the introduction of the fairy queen at his birth, and certain poetical touches which it yet exhibits, we are led to suppose that it isa rifacciamento of an earlier and better original. One of 'Tom's sports deserves note; it is when, in order to be revenged ou his playmates, he

lect right, was not originally a Bramin, but became one by adoption, like some of the worthies in the Ramayuna. Compare the multiplicity of Tom Thumb's metamorphoses with those of Taliessin as quoted by Davies; we shall then see that this diminutive personage is a slender but distinct thread of communication between the Braminical and Druidical superstitions, Even independent of the analogy between his transformations and those of Taliessin—his station in the court of King Arthur (evidently the mytholo. gical Arthur) marks him as a person of the highest fabulous antiquity in this island; while the adventure of the cow, to which there is nothing analogous in Celtic mythology, appears to connect him with India.' oh **«Svenp TomtrnG, et Menneske ikke storre end en Tommelfinger, som vil giftes med en Kone, tre Alen og tre Quarter lang, Kommer til Verden med hat paa og Karde ved siden, driver Plov; selges til en herremand som forvare ham isin SuuuSdaase,' "TI; G3 us

This 'pleasant game' is borrowed from the pseudo-hagiography of the middle ages. It is found not only in one of the spurious Gospels, but also in the legend of St. Columbanus, who, as we are told, performed a similar miracle by hanging his garment on a sunbeam.;

Mr. Tuomas Hicxaturirt, afterwards Sis Tuomas Hicxarturiert, Knight, is praised by Mr. Thomas Hearne as a 'famous champion.' The honest antiquary has identified this well-known knight with the far less celebrated Sir Frederick de Tylney, Baron of Tylney in Norfolk, the ancestor of the Tylney family, who was killed at Acon, in Syria, in the reign of Richard Ceeur de Lion; 'Hycophric, or Hycothrift,' as the mister-wight observes, 'being probably a corruption of Frederick. This happy exertion of etymological acumen is not wholly due to Hearne, who only adopted a hint given by Mr. Philip Le Neve whilome of the College of Arms. Their conjectures, however, accord but slightly with the traditions given by the accurate Spelman, in his Icenia. From the most remote antiquity, the fables and achievements of Hickifric have been obstinately credited by the inhabitants of the township of Tylney. 'Hickifric' is venerated by them as the assertor of the rights and liberties of their ancestors. The 'monstrous giant,' who guarded the Marsh, was, in truth, no other than the tyrannical lord of the manor, who attempted to keep his copyholders out of the common field, called Tilney Smeeth; but who was driven away, with his retainers, b the prowess of Tom, armed with only his axle-tree and cart-wheel. rl oni has told the story in good Latin, and we subjoin it to the text.*

We have not room to detail the pranks which Tom performed when his 'natural strength, which exceeded twenty common men,' became manifest; but they must be noticed as being correctly Scandinavian. Similar were the achievements of the great northera champion Gretter, when he kept geese upon the common, as told in his Saga. We are not very deeply read in northern lore, but we

hhope that Messrs. Grimm will agree with us that Tom's youth retraces the tales of the prowess of the youthful Siegfried, detailed m the Niflunga Saga, and in the Book of Heroes. It appears from Hearne, that the supposed axle-tree with the superincumbent wheel was represented on 'Hycothrift's' grave stone, in Tylney churchyard, in the shape of a cross.* This is the form in which all the Runic monuments represent the celebrated hammer or thunderbolt of the son of Odin, which shattered the sculls and scattered the brains of so many luckless giants. How far this surmise may be sup-

orted by Tom's skill and strength in throwing the hammer (Part.

- Chap. 48.) we will not pretend to decide. If, on the other hand, any of our antiquarian readers should think it right to withhold their assent to the proposition that Thor can be identified with Tom Hickathrift, they may have the full benefit ofvour doubts. The common people have a happy faculty of seeing whatever they chuse to believe, and of refusing to see the things in which they disbelieve. It may therefore be supposed, that the rude sculpture which the Tylneyites used to call the offensive and defensive arms of their champion, was truly nothing more than a cross, of which the upper part is inscribed in a circle, a figure often found on ancient sepulchres. ,

From Tom Hickathrift and Thor we must proceed to their immortal compeer JAcK THE Giant Killer. In Jack's memoirs, a Wormius, a Rudbeck, a Bartholinus, a Schimmlemann, a Stephanius, or a Peringskiold might discover indubitable resemblances to the fictions of the Edda. Jack, as we are told, 'having got a

+ See 'History of Jack and the Giants.' Part I. Chap. v. p. 14.—The edition which we use has no date, but was 'Printed and sold by J, Pitts, No. 14, Great St. Andrew's Street, Seven Dials.' It is far less correct than the older edition printed at York by 'J. Kendrew, near the Collier-gate.' Yet, on the whole, as Dr. Hanwoop justly

national diet, toasted cheese. To this low feeding we also attribute the want of sagacity which enabled Jack 'to outwit him,' notwithstandiig his two heads. The history states that Jack undressed himself, and as the Giant was walking towards another apartment, Jack heard him say to himself, 'Though here you lodge with me this night,

You shall not see the morning light,

My club shall dash your brains out,—quite.' * Say you so, says Jack, is that one of your Welch tricks? I hope to be as cunning as you. Then getting out of bed he found a thick billet, and laid it in the bed in his stead, and hid himself in a dark corner of the room. In the dead time of the night came the Giant with his club, and struck several blows on the bed where Jack had artfully laid the billet, and then returned to his own room, supposing,' as- the romance writer observes with emiphatical simplicity, 'that he had broken all Jack's bones.' In the morning early Jack came to thank him for his lodging. 'Oh! said the Giant, how have you rested, did you see any thing last night? No, said Jack, but a rat gave me three or four slaps with his tail,'

To this adventure, though the locus in quo is placed in Flintshire by the English writer, we find a parallel in the device practised by the Giant Skrimner when he and Thor journeyed to Skrimner's Castle of Utgaard, and related at large in the twelfth chapter of the Edda of Snorro, At midnight the mighty son of earth laid himself to sleep beneath an oak, and snored aloud. Thor, the giantkiller, resolved to rid himself of his unsuspicious companion, and struck him with his tremendous hammer. 'Hath a leaf fallen upon me from the tree?' exclaimed the awakened Giant. The Giant soon slept again, and 'snored,' as the Edda says, 'as loudly as if it had thundered in the forest.' Thor struck the Giant again, and, as he thought, the hammer made a mortal indentation in his forehead. 'What is the matter?' quoth Skrimner, 'hath an acorn fallen on my head? A third time the potent Giant snored, and a third time did the hammer descend, 'with huge two-handed sway, and with such force that Thor weened the iron had buried itself in Skrimner's temples. 'Methinks,' quoth Skrimner, rubbing his cheek, 'some moss hath fallen on my face.' Thor might be well amazed at the escape of the Giant;—but Skrimner, acting exactly like Jack, had out-witted his enemy, by placing an immense rock on the leafy couch where Thor supposed he was sleeping, and which received the blows of the hammer in his stead.

The fictions of the north, and indeed of the east, are no less distinguishable in the robbery which Jack, who, after all, was an unprincipled young dog, committed on a simple cousin of his,* 'a huge and

monstrous Giant having three heads, and who would beat five hundred men in armour. Jack terrified his three-headed cousin out of all his wits, by telling him that the king's son. was coming. 'This is heavy news indeed, quoth the giant, but I have a large vault under ground, where I will run and hide myself. In the morning, when Jack let his cousin out of the hole, he asked what he should give him for his care, seeing that his castle was not demolished. 'Why, answered Jack, I desire nothing but your o/d rusty sword, the coat in the closet, and the cap and the shoes which you keep at the bed's head. Thou shalt have them with all my heart, said the Giant, as a just reward for thy kindness in protecting me from the king's son, and be sure that thou carefully keepst them for my sake; for they are things of excellent use: the coat will keep you invisible, the cap will furnish you with knowledge, the sword cuts asunder whatever you strike, and the shoes are of extraordinary swiftness.' Every one of these wonderful articles has been stolen out of the great Northern treasury, though we cannot pretend to explain in what manner Jack's cousin, the Giant with three heads, became possessed of them. The coat is, in fact, the magic garment known in ancient German by the equivalent denomination of the 'Nebel Kappe', or Cloud Cloak, fabled to belong to King Alberich, and the other dwarfs of the Teutonic cycle of Romance, who, clad therein, could walk invisible. To them also belongs the Tarn-hut, or hat of darkness,* possessing the same virtue. Velent the cunning smith of the Edda of Semund wrought Jack's 'sword of sharpness,' which in the Wilkina Saga bears the name of Balmung. So keen was its edge that when Velent cleft his rival A-milius through the middle with the wondrous weapon, it merely seemed to Emilius as though cold water had glided down him. Shake thyself, said Velent. AZmilius shook himself, and fell dead into two halves, one on each side of his chair. That the stories of Velent's skill were well known in this country is evinced by the Auchinleck text of the Geste of King Horn, where he is called Weland. Jack's shoes of swiftness were once worn by Loke when he

escaped

escaped from Valhalla. In the Calmuck romance of Ssidi Kur, the Chan steals a similar pair of seven league boots from the 'Tehadkurrs, or evil spirits, by means of the cap which made him invisible, which he won from certain quarrelling children, or dwarfs whom he encounters in the middle of a forest.'* Are these mere incidental coincidences between the superstitions and fictions of the followers of Buddha and of those of Odin?

In the history of 'Jack and the Bean-stalk, the consistency of the characters is still finely preserved. 'The awful distich put into the mouth of the Jette or Ettin, the principal agent in this romance,

* Snouk but, snouk ben, I find the smell of earthly men,' is scarcely inferior to the 'fee faw fui' of the keen-scented anthropophaginian of the other. 'The bean-stalk,' the top whereof when Jack looked upwards he could not discern as it appeared lost in the clouds,' has grown in fanciful imitation of the ash Ygdrasil reaching, according to the Edda, from hell to heaven. As to the beautiful harp which 'played of its own accord,' and which Jack stole from the giant, we must find a parallel for it in the wonderful harp made of the breast bone of the king's daughter, and which sang so sweetly to the miller, 'Binnorie Oh Binnorie,' and in old Dunstan's harp which sounded without hands when hanging in the vale.

Before we dismiss the Giganticide, we must remark that most

of his giants rest upon good romance authority: or, to speak

* « Now the son of the Chan and his trusty servant travelled along a river and arrived in a wood, where they met many children who were quarrelling with each other. "Why do you thus dispute?" said they.

"We have found a cap in this wood, and each of us wishes to keep it."

"What is the use of the cap?"

"The cap hath this virtue, he who wears it is seen neither by the gods, nor men, nor the Tchadkurvs."

"Now go all of ye to the end of the forest, and runhither. And I will keep thecap and I will give it to him who first reaches this spot and wins the race.

'So spake the son of the Chan, and the children ran, but when they came back they could not find the cap, for he had placed it on the head of his companion, and they sought for it in vain. -

* And the son of the Chan and his companion travelled onwards, and they came to a forest wherein they met many Tchadkurrs who were quarrelling with each other. "Why do you thus dispute?" said they.

* It is I, exclaimed each Tchadkurr, to whom these boots belong.

« What is the use of the boots?

'© He who wears these boots," answered the Tchadkurrs, " is conveyed to any country wherein he wishes himself."

* « Now," unswerred the son of the Chan, " go all of you that way, and he who first runs hither shall obtain the boots."

* And the Tchadkurrs ran their race accordingly. But the Chan's son had concealed the boots in the bosom of his companion, who at the same time had the cap upon his head. And the Tchadkurrs sought for the boots, but they found them not, and they went away.'—Second Relation of Ssidi Kur, 

more correctly, Jack's history is a popular and degraded version of the traditions upon which our earliest romances are founded. 'The Mount of Cornwall,' which was kept by a large and monstrous Giant, is St. Michael's Mount; and the Giant Corinoran, whom Jack dispatched there, and who 'was eighteen feet high and about three yards round, is the same who figures in the romance of Tristan. It was by killing this Corimoran, (the Corineeus probably of Jeffery of Monmouth and the Brut,) that Jack acquired his triumphal epithet of the Giant-Killer.*

In order that students of British gigantology may not be misled in their researches, we think it proper to inform them that they must take great care not to confound 'the History of Jack and the Giants' with 'the History of the Giants. These works differ essentially in merit, and, although the latter begins with the history of Goliah the champion of the Philistines, yet the adventures contained in the remainder of the work, and particularly all those which relate to the Giants Trapsaca and Traudello, are, as the Irish bishop observed of Gulliver's travels, exceedingly incredible.

Of rarer occurrence than the heroic narratives to which our attention has hitherto been directed, is the 'history of Friar Rusu the devil's brother.' 'The friar was known to Reginald Scott before the history of his pranks was published. Scott ranks him in the same category with Robin Goodfellow, so that Robin and the Friar were alike the heroes of popular and traditionary tales. There is an ancient Danish poem, which treats 'of brother Rus, how he did service as cook and monk in the monastery of Esserom.' There is reason to suppose that the English story-book and the Danish history are derived from one common original, well known on the continent in times previous to the reformation, for, as Bruno Seidelius sings,

* Quis non legit, que Frater Rauschius egit?"

It is worthy of remark that the Danish Rus is made to travel

through the air to England, where he possesses the king's daughter.

* « Now when the magistrates who employed John heard that the job was over, they sent for him, declaring he should henceforth be called "Jack the Giant Killer," and in honour thereof presented him with a sword and embroidered belt, upon which these words were written in letters of gold:—

* Here's the valiant Cornish man, Who slew the giant Corinoran.'

In the last London edition of Jack the Giant Killer, the printer's devil who corrected the sheets has arbitrarily chosen to read Cormoran. We have not scrupled to réstore the true reading, although the spurious reading gives a smoother verse. According to the Brat it is Corineus who kills the giant, but as he was a giant himself, tradition has only changed sides, .

Cortnevs estoit moult grant Hardis et grant come yaiant,

There has been a fair exchange of nursery tales between the two countries, for in return for Brother Russ, we gave them the 'history of the lucky Richard Whittington, Lord Mayor of London,' whose life has been translated into Danish, and whose good fortune is now as well known in Bergen and Drontheim as in his own native land of Cockney. Puss has thus sailed half round the world, from the Gulf of Persia to the Northern Sea.

How ectass stands as the leader of a merry troop; Tom TRAM, the son-in-law of Mother Winter, Tom Striteu, the tailor, and Tom Longe, the carrier of the Men of Gotham, follow in his train, whose penny 'histories,' all imitated from his 'merrye jeste,' are now introuvables. 'They all belong to the ancient and noble and widely dispersed family of Tom Foot, which has obtained such pre-eminence and dignity in church and state throughout all Christendom. 'Yn the land of Sassen,' says old Copland, in the village of Keeling, 'there dwelled a man that was named Nicholas Howleglass, that had a wyfe named Wyneke, that laye a child bed in the same village, and that childe was borne to Christening and named Tyell Howleglass.' It were long to detail his fearful jokes which sometimes brought him to the gallows, yet saved him from the halter. He was buried with his coffin standing on one end, as the visitants at the Abbey believe of Ben Jonson, at Mollen, near Lubeck: and you may see his grave-stone under the great lime tree in the church-yard; and his rebus, to wit an owl and a looking glass, cut upon the stone. Ulenspiegel, as he is called in German, has almost made the tour of Europe: his life was first published in the Nether-Saxon dialect in 1483. Our English translation of the 'merrye jeste of a man that was called Howleglass, and of many marveylous thinges and jestes that he did in his lyfe in Eastland,' was 'Imprinted at London in Tamestreete, at the Vintre, in Three Craned Warfe, by Wyllyam Copland.' According to the technical phrase, it was done into English from the High Dutch. There is also a Flemish translation, which, well purified from all aspersions on holy church, is now a chap book in armen The Flemish faithful are earnestly warned not to purchase the shameful edition printed at Amsterdam, by Brother Jansz, in the Burgwal, at the sign of the "Silver Can," the same being calculated to vex and scandalize all good Catholics.'

'SimpLe Simon's misfortunes' are such as are incident to all the human race, since they arose 'from his wife Margery's cruelty, which began the very morning after their marriage,' and we therefore do not know whether it is necessary to seek out for a 'Teutonic or Northern original of this once popular book. 'The Fifteen Joys of Matrimony' being also diffused pretty equally

over the wide world, we cannot presume to confine the' origin of the tractate concerning them to our island.

Now that we have fairly entered into the matrimonial chapter we must needs speak of Morner Buncu, not the Mother Bunch whose fairy tales are repeated to the little ones, but she whose 'cabinet,' when broken open, reveals so many powerful love-spells: it is Mother Bunch who teaches the blooming damsel to recal the fickle lover, or to fix the wandering gaze of the cautious swain, attracted by her charms, yet scorning the fetters of the parson, and dreading the still more fearful vision of the churchwarden, the constable, the justice, the warrant, and the jail. We dare not venture to unfold the incantations of the sapient beldam; but perhaps there may be equal efficacy in the 'Academy of Compliments', or Whole Art of Courtship, being the rarest and most exact way of wooing a maid or widow by the way of dialogue and complimental expressions, and which used to be sold by Mr. Hollis in Shoemaker-row near Doctor's Commons: and in the metrical magic of the 'Posies for rings and other things,' given in this same Academy; posies in no small request on the feast of good St. Valentine, however ill the saint may view the celebration of his festival.

——_——-_—— Bishop Valentine

Left us examples to do deeds of charity,

To feed the hungry, clothe the naked, visit The weak and sick, to entertain the poor, And give the dead a Christian burial.

These were the works of piety he did practise, And bade us imitate, not seek for lovers.

The 'Academy of Compliments' is abridged from the 'Jardin d'Amour,' the last edition of which is augmented by 'plusieurs lettres familiéres pour l'utilité de la jeunesse;' and, as our good friend Madame Garnier informs us, there is not a peasant in Champagne who will attempt to woo, in an honourable way, except according to the established forms and precedents contained in this useful manual. And even the boors in the Low Countries are equally obedient to the lessons of its Flemish translation, the 'Konst der Minnen,' when they sidle into the spinning-room, or try to drop upon one knee before the Juffrow, as their fathers did before them. Like its ambitious prototype, the 'Roman de la Rose,' the 'Garden of Love' has borrowed the principles of the great master Ovid: its author had more morality than the heathen poet, and less learning than Jean de Meung and Guillaume de Loris, his elaborate followers, who thought it necessary to invoke 'Reason' and the seven sciences her handmaids, merely to aid the lover in winning a woman's heart! Alas! many a year has flown since

We have not the slightest idea that Jack the Giant Killer, or any of the volumes of the peuny library, will be held cheap by our readers, but we anticipate that less respect will be paid to Hearne and Le Neve, and Spelman, and the other learned archeologists of whose researches we have availed ourselves. Yet with all due submission to the judges in this behalf, we cannot help thinking that no literary productions are treated so unfairly, as the works of the antiquary,

'__—_—_—_——— in closet close ypent Of sober face, with learned dust besprent;' whose very name is become a byeword and a reproach even amongst his literary brethren. 'They hunt and drive him out of the commonwealth of letters, and immolate him as a scape-goat to the devouring appetite of the scorner. Honest zeal, even in a bad cause, demands our praise: and men of sense and genius should therefore bear with the enthusiasm of men of sense and learning, although they cannot participate in their glowing feelings. It was this enthusiasm which invigorated the erudite who flourished in the era that immediately followed the restoration of letters, and which, in times nearer our own, sustained the unwearied hands of Grzvius and Gronovius, and Rymer and Prynne, and Montfaucon and Muratori, whilst they accomplished their Herculean tasks. But the age of folios has gone by, like the age of chivalry, and both may be regretted by posterity. A great book has been called a great evil, and this pithy axiom has been received without much inquiry into its truth or application. It was said of Albertus Magnus, that he could have been burned in a pile composed of one set of his own voluminous works. Such an author may not deserve an apotheosis merely on account of his industry, yet it does not follow that because his pen was prolific, his productions are only worthy of the flames. In the opinion of the urchin, the Christ-cross-row is a mile too long. Larger in their growth, yet equally lazy, are those who pride themselves in dealing out the small talk of literary censure, and who mock at the author of a ponderous tome, concealing their own inaptitude for the acquisition of knowledge by affecting to despise the volume which imparts it. These idlers are followed by the closer reasoners who have read the work which .they criticise, and who think it beseeming to censure the author for his deficiency in taste and judgment. This accusation, grounded upon well-sounding words, and specious phrases, generally rebounds from side to side; it is repeated in the bookseller's shop, echoed in the library, and buzzed in the drawing-room, and the multitude confirm

the sentence by acclamation. Taste, however, is governed by an uncertain standard; and the critic would do well to recollect that the literary character may fail on the right side, when betraying what is so often termed want of judgment. It is ungraceful to be encumbered with learning, to swelter beneath the ample folds and furred trimmings of the academical robe, but yet this display of opulence is more creditable to the wearer, than the pitiful nakedness of the literary vagrant. Mere learning may tire, yet instruct: the conceit of ignorance will always disgust without affording instruction.

An author who directs his energies to austere studies is apt to be voluminous. Desiring to become fully intelligible to the uninstructed, and eager, at the same time, to gratify the erudite with information hitherto unknown to them, he exhausts his subject. Hence the learned are often induced to censure him as trivial, the unlearned as obscure: and by each his comprehensive intent is unworthily contemned. Still more unreasonable are those who shght the intensity of labour, which is called for by the very nature of bis subject. 'The mould of the garden-bed may be turned up by the spade, and watered by a lady's hand: but he who wishes to found a settlement in the forest must toil in hewing the massy trunks, and in bestowing a sevenfold ploughing on the stubborn soil.

Wit, in unthinking levity, has sometimes scourged the studious tribes with undeserved harshness. Yet still more unkind and uncharitable are the dull, the sad, the solemn, and the grave, towards the antiquary, who, if endowed with genius, yields to the seductions to which he is then peculiarly exposed. Imagination endangers the reputation of the learned. 'They follow the ignis fatuus over marshes and quagmires, and the trembling surface sinks beneath the steps of the giants of literature, whilst the lighter limbs of the poet, who is equally deluded by the wandering fire, enable him to spring along with ease. Ritson, attacking Warton, affords a striking example of the spiteful pleasure enjoyed by a sour, clear-headed precisian, when be detects the errors of a superior intellect. But we are not always satisfied even with the tests of sober reason as propounded by those who judge with more fairness, and who, proceeding upon decent and respectable principles of criticism, damn the ingenious theories of the historian, the mythologist, or the philologer, because they seem wild and speculative. A writer who pursues obscure and difficult inquiries, is compelled to accept the proofs afforded by circumstantial evidence. There are certain optical glasses which, when applied to the eye, collect the spots and lines dispersed on a coloured tablet into a symmetrical form: like these, bis mind associates and assembles the ideas dispersed through time and space. When he appears most arbitrary in bis assumptions, most fanciful

in his conjectures, he is fortified by the internal consciousness, that his hypothesis is true; he feels a conviction of the truth which he cannot impart to others. In his devious course he guides himself by indications which the unpractised cannot discern. He tracks himself across the ocean by the floating weeds and the flight of the sea-fowl, and he convinces himself of the existence of the continent though his bark may never reach its shores.

The pleasures of laborious writers arise from their labours; they are joyful and triumphant when they verify a date, or adjust a verse, or explain the legend of a medal, tasks of which the world is reckless; and the attention with which they regard these supposed trifles is held to indicate a puny, feeble; mind yet they only yield to a universal instinct. Whatever we discover, we make our own; whatever is our own, we love. The traveller prizes a sparry fragment which he has broken from its native cavern, above the choicest specimens which he finds in the cabinet of another. 'The game can only be run down by the sportsman who takes delight in the chase, and this gratification is not to be forgotten by him when he contemplates the objects which occasioned it. Hence he may sometimes be induced to set a value on the skin of the brock, and even on the antlers of the deer, which surprizes the sober citizen, who sees nothing in these enlivening trophies save hide and horn. Vanity is the original sin of literature; but the vanity of the antiquary does not savour of egotism: he contents himself with being proud of his researches. Unveiling the deity to the worshipper, he, the hierophant, claims not the incense, and tastes no portion of the sacrifice. Ministering to no faction, desiring no reward, and contemning the praise of the multitude, he takes refuge in the studious cloister. His spirit walks in communion with the mighty dead, Shadows are his consorts, whom he attempts to grasp as bodies, because to him the vision is reality. Occasionally his tongue falters, and his words are confused, but the accuracy of his judgment or the vigour of his intellect are not therefore impaired—his transient giddiness is caused by the height wherein he soars—he looks down upon middle earth from the summit of Olympus, or the battlements of Valhalla.
