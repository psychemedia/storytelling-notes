# Gambrinus (Cambrinus) King of Beer

"Cambrinus, King of Beer", from *Tales of a Beer Drinker*, 1868, Charles Deulin

*I bring you a tale*  
*Of [festive good cheer / sorrow and cheer]*  
*Gather round for my story:*  
*The invention of beer.*

Cambrinus (Gambrinus) was a __handsome__ young __assistant__ to a __glassmaker__ in Flanders, on the French and Belgian border. There were __two reasons__ why Gambrinus would never become a master glassmaker. For one, a Master would only teach their own sons the real secrets of the craft. For two, Gambrinus was a rubbish apprentice. He couldn't even get the furnace to the correct temperature.

Things were complicated by the fact that he was __besotted__ with his master's beautiful daughter, __Flandrine__. They would have made an attractive couple, but Flandrine expected rather more of a potential husband than a talentless apprentice of dubious parentage and not a penny to his name: he just was not husband material for a respectable master glassmaker's daughter.

Even so, the more she ignored him, the more he fell in love with her. Throughout the cold winter months, the __teasing__ he got from the other apprentices grew unbearable, and the dissatisfaction of the master made him realise that he should seek his fortune elsewhere.

At the end of the year, he __left__. As he made his way out of town, he chanced upon a __violin__, the Devil's favourite instrument. Although he'd never played a violin before, it seemed that he was a natural, as talented at music as he wasn't at glassmaking. In no time at all, he was playing to audiences and crowds in towns and villages all over Flanders. Throughout the summer, and the Autumn, his __reputation__ grew. Word got back to his hometown, and Cambrinus was invited to play there for the Winter celebrations.

Things started well enough — who could believe that a failed glassmaker's apprentice could become such a good musician in so short a time? — and as he played, the people danced. And as he played faster, they danced faster. And as they danced faster, he played faster. It was all going so we... until he saw Flandrine...

At which point, he __lost it__. He lost it completely... This was his chance to impress her with his virtuosity, and he blew it. Flandrine walked out in disgust. Everyone thought he was making fun of them. They booed, and they jeered, and they mocked him. It started to get rowdy and the guards were called.

Gambrinus was hauled before the __judge__ and charged with causing a disturbance. The judge was a surly, corrupt old fellow, who sentenced Gambrinus to the pillory and to be thrown into jail for a month.

It was bleak midwinter. He left prison full of shame, with no chance of being able to win the hand of Flandrine. He could see only one way out.

He walked into the forest, the trees still bare of their leaves, and came to a __crossroads__. There was a large oak tree at one corner. He took a rope from his bag, fashioned a noose, and started to climb the tree. He would end it all. At which point, he noticed a tall __man__ in a long __green__ hunting __coat__, just standing there, watching.

"Don't mind me" said the man.

Gambrinus felt a little embarrassed.

"Are you, erm, are you waiting for someone?"

"It just so happens that I am, Cambrinus," said the man.  "I am waiting for you."

How did the man knew Gambrinus' name? And:

"What do you mean you're waiting for me?"

"All hanged men make their home in hell, Gambrinus."

Ah... Gambrinus hadn't expected *that* sort of an end.

"And you would be...?"

"Indeed, I am", said the __Devil__.

"Erm... Err... so, so what if I *don't* hang myself?"

The Devil laughed. "Going by the state of you", he said, "hell on earth?" And he laughed again.

Now Gambrinus had heard of people doing __deal__s with the devil, so perhaps that was his way out? After all, he'd already lost pretty much everything. And he would still give anything to find favour with Flandrine. Now if he were wealthy...?

"I could certainly help you with that" said the Devil. "How about I give you access to __untold wealth__ for, say, thirty years? And then you give me your soul."

It was a good deal. The deal was done.

When Gambrinus woke up the next day, things seemed different.

He'd never been much good at __games__ before, particularly games that required any level of *skill*. And he'd never been much good at games that required any *luck*. He'd been particularly bad at games that required both skill *and* luck. But now, it seemed, that whatever the game, whatever the challenge, the luck ran his way... and he __won__. He won A LOT.

Cards, dice, archery competitions, vinkensport, even *vinkensport* — finch-fighting — which was very popular in Dutch speaking Flanders at the time. Now this was nothing like the good old English sport of cockfighting, either, where specially bred birds with a particularly bad attitude were trained to fight each other to the death, as their owners bet on the outcome. This was far more refined. For in __vinkensport__, finch fighting, each owner must count how many times their bird can sing its song in one hour, with the score kept on a blackboard.

And Gambrinus' bird sang its refrains, not just with perfect repetition, but far faster than any other bird had ever done before, or even been spoken of doing. But more than that, Gambrinus' bird gave a perfect performance of over 900 times in one hour (950, at least). And so even at vinkensport, Gambrinus would always take first prize, as well as the winnings from a hefty side bet he'd always manage to place too.

Anyway, Gambrinus won competitions with his finch for miles around, and with all the other games of skill and chance, he was soon very __wealthy__ indeed.

When he returned home, he could afford to be seen in all the __best places__ around town. In all the places that Flandrine might be seen. One day he saw her. He was still handsome, although his stare had something of a manic look about it as his eyes darted around the room, looking for any opportunity to try out his luck. But when he saw Flandrine, he was all focus.

"You seem to have done well for yourself" said Flandrine, but when she found out he had come by his wealth from "__GAMBLING???__ You think I would marry a GAMBLER?", he was left, once again, chastised. And embarrassed.

"What use is money" he said to himself, "if it can't buy me love?" And he set off trudging back towards the __crossroads__. He opened his bag, and took out the rope, still fashioned into a noose. He was just looking up at the branch on the old oak tree when he heard a familiar voice behind him: "Back again? The gambling doesn't suit you?"

Gambrinus turned round to see the Devil standing there, with the __judge in tow__. He had sold his soul to the Devil several years before, and today was his pay day.

"I hear that people __drink to forget__..." said the Devil, "and we did say you could have thirty years... And as you can see," he gestured to the Judge, "I am rather *busy* at the moment. You *would not believe* how pedantic these legal types can be over the paperwork..."

So Gambrinus put the rope back in his sack— perhaps he wasn't quite ready for hell just yet — and set off walking back into town...

He stopped at the first ale house he came to; now, at that time, ale was made from barley, water and yeast, and flavoured with herbs. But rather than making him forget, it made Gambrinus even more depressed. "What do I have to do to make her love me? I love her so much...." And he cried into his pint.

He moved onto red wine, but that just made him seethe with resentment and jealousy over the other good for nothing men who made eyes at her, and whom she looked back at, with favour.

The whisky, the brandy, the gin: they just made his head spin. And as the world spun round, all he could see was dozens and dozens of dancing Flandrines, spinning around as she danced with other suitors.

He walked back to the __crossroads__.

Eventually, he managed to get the rope out of his bag.

Eventually, he managed to get half way up to the first branch before falling back again, landing on top of the man in the green coat.

"Maybe we're going about this the wrong way?", said the devil, picking himself up from the floor and brushing himself down. "Come with me. I've been working on a __new idea__...".

After a short walk, they came out of the wood into a wide open field, lined with rows and rows of poles and wires and fragrant plants growing up them: __hops__. "I think this, perhaps, will cure you of your love sickness..."

With *hops* added to the barley as well as the yeast, and the water, you can make a new sort of drink... *beer*. The ambrosia of men, if not of the gods.

"Just crush the barley", said the Devil, "brew it in vats, and *then* mix in the hops... and they will give it a flavour like nothing you've ever tasted before. It will age and mature in the barrel. You can make it blonde or brown. And it will make you happy. And sociable. And Flandrine, well, who needs Flandrine if you can can be in the company of beer, and the company of other beer drinkers?! Here, try some..."

And he did.

Gambrinus took a hearty swig and... his first taste. And *bleurghhh*... That's horrible...

The Devil gestured that he should try another taste.

It didn't taste quite so bad this time...

Rather than sipping it, he tried quaffing it...

And, actually, it wasn't that bad. It wasn't that bad at all. And he started to relax. And to start thinking. And to smile to himself.

"This — *beer*, did you call it? — once you get a taste for it, it tastes pretty good. But I also have a taste for something else: for *revenge*. The people in my home town mocked me. And now I want to mock them back, I want __revenge__..."

The Devil smiled: he liked this sort of thinking, and so together, they both came up with a plan...

It was a Sunday, and all around them was the sound of Church __bells__, calling people to prayer...

"What is it about the sound of bells," said the Devil, "that makes people feel compelled to go to Church?"

Gambrinus shrugged.

Now the devil is nothing if not resourceful: he's always looking for an angle, he's always looking for a way in... And the Devil also has a sense of humour - Gambrinus had had his chance with the devil's own favourite instrument once before, with the violin. But what if he could use God's bells to cause mischief?

"I have it! Gather some bells, some tubular bells, some chimes. Two dozen or more, all properly tuned; then hook up two keyboards: one for keys, one for pedals. The sound will be like nothing anyone has heard before; it will drive them crazy..."

So Gambrinus set to work. With some of his gambling money, he managed to the instrument the devil had come up with - a __*carillon*__, they're called. With rather more of it, he built a brewery. And with the last of the money, he made a belfry for the brewery, and set the carillon in it.

For the __opening day__, he had made two brews: a blond beer, and a brown one. *Everyone* was invited to the first tasting...

And everyone hated it... "Erghh... that's so bitter..."

But then, Gambrinus started to play the chimes. And with some semblance of his previous musical talent, he got the chimes to play sounds and tunes the likes of which the people had never heard before. And if they had danced before, back when he had been able to play the violin, they danced now with the passion of whirling dervishes. And Gambrinus played on...

"Stop...", they pleaded, "we need to rest"...

But he played on some more...

"Stop" they pleaded, "we __need a drink__"...

And Gambrinus smiled.

And as everyone tried the beer *this* time, they found it to be refreshing. It was good... it was really good... Cheers!

After a pint or two each, and maybe one or two more for the heavier drinkers amongst them, they were ready to dance again...

Over the following days, the news began to spread. People came from miles around to try the beer and to dance to the carillon.

So taken was the King of the Netherlands by the newly invented beer that he made Gambrinus a __Duke__; but the title Gambrinus preferred to all others was the title that the people had given to him: the "king of beer".

Every day, Gambrinus would drink, along with his patrons. His nose turned red and his face filled out; to say he became portly would be too generous. But he was a sociable host, and would chat to friends old and new, from dawn to dusk, and always with a pint in his hand.

One day, __Flandrine__ came to visit. Now that he was a Duke, well, he had come up in the world, hadn't he? But he didn't even recognize her, simply offered her a pint, as he would offer anyone a pint. He had completely forgotten about her. And this time, it was she who went away dejected.

Eventually, the thirty years from his bargain with the Devil were up. Midwinter. It is said that the Devil sent the corrupt old __judge__ to __collect__ Gambrinus' soul, and that Gambrinus had seen him coming. He'd offered him a drink, the drink had had a drink, and before too long, the drink had had the judge. Gambrinus had wandered over to the bell tower, and started to play the carillon, and before the judge knew what was happening, he was caught up in a whirl of dancers. He'd never been the life and soul of a party before, but he found it was fun. And the Dad dancing started in earnest. Eventually, he collapsed on the floor, in a dazed and happy stupor, for three days and three nights.

When he came too, he was too embarrassed to go back to collect Gambrinus' soul, or even to return to face the wrath of the devil. He's __still wandering__ now, from bar to bar. I'm pretty sure I met him here once, in this very place, and it was he who me this tale.

And so it was that the Devil would have to wait until Gambrinus' life met its natural end, at the ripe old age of a hundred. By that time, he had become something of a fixture at the end of the bar; he still drank every day, his shape had became ever more rotund, and his conversation ever more wooden. So much so, in fact, that when the Devil himself came to collect Gambrinus' soul, he found that that Gambrinus had turned into a __beer barrel__.

And that is the end of the story. Except to say that the Devil had the last laugh, as he so often does. Because Gambrinus is as much a __nobody__ today, as he was at the start of the story. Nobody remembers him as the original King of Beer. Or at least, perhaps not until now.
