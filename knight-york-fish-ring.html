<h1>The Fish and the Ring<a class="headerlink" href="#the-fish-and-the-ring" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h1>
<p>The English folk tale “The Fish and the Ring” is a classic fairy tale in which someone of low-birth is prophesied to marry someone of much greater social standing. Although obstacles are put in place to prevent the marriage, a happy ending ensues. Although this story felt familiar to me when I came across it in a modern collection, <em>English Fairy Tales and Legends</em>, by Rosalind Kerven (2008/2019), under the title “The Knight of York (Yorkshire)”, I don’t recall any particular occasion, if any, on which I have heard it told.</p>
<p>A popular variant of the English version of the tale of <em>The Fish and the Ring</em> was first published in a popular form in Joseph Jacobs <em>English Fairy Tales</em>, 1890. The gist of that version is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>A shopkeeper in York has a large family that just got larger. A nobleman calls, sees their distress at another mouth to feed, and offers to read the child’s fortune: he is shocked to learn she will marry his son, so he offers to adopt her and takes her away, at which point he throws her in the River Ouse. A farmer finds her and brings her up. Years later, the nobleman comes across her again, is persuaded to read her fortune, and realises who she is. He writes a letter to his brother saying the girl will bring shame and misfortune on the family, and she should be killed at once. He asks the girl to deliver the letter in Scarborough. Along the way, she stops at an inn, a thief sees the letter and swaps it for another (“marry the girl to my son as quickly as possible — she will bring great honour and fortune”). The girl delivers the changed letter, and is married to the nobleman’s son. The nobleman arrives, furious, takes the girl outside, throws a ring into the sea saying she can only return if she has the ring. She finds work in a kitchen; there is a feast, and the nobleman and his son (her husband) will be there. She finds the ring in a fish; the fish is served to the nobleman and the girl is revealed. The son chastises the father and they all live happily ever after.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>In the telling, I’ve found there are several tricky bits: getting the fortune telling to work in a coherent way, handling the girl’s exile as triggered by the loss of the ring, and disguising the girl in the run up to the denouement. There is a natural opportunity to break the story with a cliff hanger when the letter is switched in the inn, or at the point at which the nobleman’s brother reads the letter. In the original telling, what the thief replaced the original letter with is described at the time of its substitution, but we can hide that until the letter is opened and read. Or perhaps describe preparations for a great event that is revealed as a wedding, not an execution, and then explain the actual contents of the letter. There is also an opportunity to include the use of a hand of glory when the thief enters the inn. Indeed, in the resource that Jacobs got the story from, Baring Gould’s appendix to Henderson’s <em>Notes on the Folklore of the Northern Counties of England and the Borders</em>, 1866, the (Yorkshire) tale of the <em>Hand of Glory</em> is described, as well as the (Yorkshire) tale of the <em>Fish and the Ring</em>.</p>
<p>So let’s see how Jacobs (re)told the tale:</p>
<p>## Earlier Versions of <em>The Fish and the Ring</em></p>
<p>Jacobs provides the following note on the tale:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>XXXV. THE FISH AND THE RING.</p>
<p><em>Source.</em> — Henderson, <em>l.c.</em>, p. 326, from a communication by the Rev. S. Baring-Gould.</p>
<p><em>Parallels.</em> — “Jonah rings” have been put together by Mr. Clouston in his <em>Popular Tales</em>, i. 398, &amp;c. : the most famous are those of Polycrates, of Solomon, and the Sanskrit drama of ” Sakuntala,” the plot of which turns upon such a ring. ” Letters to kill bearer ” have been traced from Homer downwards by Prof. Khöler on Gonzenbach, ii. 220, and “the substituted letter” by the same authority in <em>Occ. u. Orr</em>, ii. 289. Mr. Baring-Gould, who was one of the pioneers of the study of folk-tales in this country, has given a large number of instances of “the pre-ordained marriage” in folk-tales in Henderson, <em>l.c.</em></p>

<li><p>THE FISH AND THE RING. ( Yorkshire .)</p></li>
</ol>
<p>There lived in York three hundred years ago a very poor man, who had a little shop under the shadow of the Minster towers. He had already three daughters and two sons when his wife gave him hopes of a sixth child. Nor were these expectations blighted, for in due course of time she presented him with a little girl. The poor man groaned at the sight, took the child, and laid it on the counter before him, shedding tears at the prospect of having another mouth to fill. A knight who was riding by heard his sobs, and inquiring the cause, learned that the new babe was <em>un petit peu de trop</em> in the house. Now, being a sorcerer, the knight opened his great Book of Fate, and as he read therein his hair bristled on his head, and his cheek grew pale, for he saw it plainly written that this nursling babe was to be his son’s wife. Determined to avoid this catastrophe, he offered to adopt the child and endow it with all bis wealth. The delighted father agreed, and gave the babe into the arms of the knigjit, who carried it to the hanks of the Ouse and flung it in. But the little creature did not sink. Its dress buoyed it up, and it was washed ashore near a fisherman’s cottage. This good man, finding the poor wailing child on the river-bank, brought it home, and with his wife’s consent adopted it, and under their roof it grew up to be a handsome girl of fifteen.</p>
<p>One day the knight came riding along the river with a number of friends. They called at the fisherman’s cottage, and asked for some fish. The girl came to the door, and all the riders were struck by her beauty. As they continued their ride, they praised her much for her courteousness and the loveliness of her face, till the knight jestingly said he would search the Book of Fate to see who should be her husband. He did so, and found, to his terror, that this girl was the same whom he had flung over the bridge and believed to be dead long ago. So, leaving his comrades, he rode back to the cottage and asked the fisherman to allow his daughter to take a letter for him to his brother, a noble knight, at Scarborough. Then he wrote a letter to this effect:—</p>
<p>‘ Dear Brother, — Take the bearer and put her to death immediately.—Yours affectionately.’</p>
<p>Sealing this, he gave it to the girl, and she started on her journey. On the way she slept a night in a little inn. Now it fell out that a thief broke into the inn that night and entered the maiden’s room, where he found the letter, and opening it he read it. Then turning his dark lanthorn on the face of the sleeping girl, he thought, ‘How sad that this beautiful damsel should be the bearer of her own sentence of death ! Surely she deserves a better fate.’ Then, taking a pen, he wrote on paper a note, as though from the knight, telling the brother to marry the girl to his son. Having done this, he sealed the letter and placed it in the girl’s purse, whence he had abstracted the real letter. She, waking the next morning, and knowing nothing of what had. taken place during the night, hastened to Scarborough, where she was well received by the knight’s brother. He read the letter, and gave immediate orders for the celebration of her nuptials with the knight’s son, who was then staying at his castle.</p>
<p>Some days after, the knight arrived at his brother’s mansion, and was much astonished and perplexed to see the course which affairs had taken, and to find that all his attempts to frustrate the purposes of fate had been in vain. However, he was not a bit more disposed than before to take matters quietly, so dragging the poor girl to the shore by her hair, he drew his dagger to stab her. She fell on her knees and implored him to spare her life, on which he so far relented that he plucked a golden ring from his finger and cast it as far as he could into the tumbling waves, saying to her, ‘ Swear to me that you will not come within my sight till that ring is on your finger, and I will spare your life.’ She took the requisite oath and fled the place.</p>
<p>Far and wide did she wander, begging from door to door, till at last she found a situation as cook in a nobleman’s house. One day, when guests were arriving, she looked from the window and saw the knight, her cruel father-in-law, and his son, her husband. Trembling, she hid herself in the kitchen, and her tears were mingled with the food she dressed. Just before dinner a fisherman came to the door with a magnificent fish for sale. She took it in and began to clean it. Scarcely had she opened it when she saw something glittering in its stomach. She examined the shining substance—and, lo! it was the knight’s ring ! Her heart was now full of joy, and her tears were lost in smiles. She cooked the dinner so well that the knight, her father-in-law, asked his host who was bis cook.</p>
<p>‘A strange girl,’ replied he, ‘ who came begging to my door, and whom I received into my house from charity. Ho! some of you servants, bid her come up into the dining-hall.’</p>
<p>The girl, receiving this command, washed her face, braided her hair, and put on her best array; then, with the ring on her finger, she entered the hall where all were feasting.</p>
<p>The revellers turned to look at her, for she seemed as fair as the moon, as lovely as a rose. With an exclamation of rage and dismay, the knight rose to his feet. He recognised her at once, and, drawing his sword, rushed forward to cut her down; but she held up her hand with a smile, and there he saw the ring he had east into the sea. Now, at length he acknowledged that he was powerless to resist fate, and suffered her to remain in peace with his son, who loved her dearly, and she became famous through the land for her beauty, her courtesy, and her goodness.</p>
