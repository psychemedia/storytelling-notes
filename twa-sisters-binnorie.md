John Whyte sings 'The Twa Sisters', followed by a discussion about the motivation in the story told in this version and another version of the song.

There is no mention in the song of what happened to the wicked sister. Betsy Whyte insists that John has omitted two verses dealing with "her true lover John". John thinks these verses belong to an entirely different song. The motivation in John's version is that the younger sister wants to take the elder sister's place as heir to her father's lands. The fiddle made from the dead sister's breastbone reveals what happened. John heard the song from his mother.

There were two sisters, they went playing,  
With a hie downe done a downe-a  
To see their father's ships come sayling in.  
With a hy downe downe a downe-a  
And when they came unto the sea-brynn,  
The elder did push the younger in.  
'O sister, O sister, take me by the gowne,  
And drawe me up upon the dry ground.'  
'O sister, O sister, that may not bee,  
Till salt and oatmeale grow both of a tree.'  
Somtymes she sanke, somtymes she swam,  
Until she came unto the mill-dam.  
The miller runne hastily downe the cliffe,  
And up lie betook her withouten her life.  
What did he doe with her brest-bone?  
He made him a violl to play thereupon.  
What did lie doe with her fingers so small?  
He niade him peggs to his violl withall.  
What did he doe with her nose-ridge?  
Unto his violl he made him a bridge.  
What did he doe with her veynes so blew?  
He made him strings to his violl thereto.  
What did he doe with her eyes so bright?  
Upon his violl he played at first sight.  
What tlid he doe with her tongue so rough?  
Unto the violl it spake enough.  
What did lie doe with her two shinnes?  
Unto the violl they danc'd Moll Syms.  
Then bespake the treble string,  
'O yonder is my father the king.'  
Then bespake the second string,  
'O yonder sitts my mother the queen.'  
And then bespake the strings all three,  
'O yonder is my sister that drowned mee.'  
'Now pay the miller for his payne,  
And let him bee gone in the divel's name.'

Binnorie

OŃCE upon a time there were two king's daughters lived in a bower near the bonny milldams of Binnorie. And Sir William came wooing the eldest and won her love and plighted troth with glove and with ring. 

But after a time he looked upon the youngest, with her cherry cheeks
and golden hair, and his love grew towards her till he cared no longer for the eldest one. So she hated her sister for taking away Sir William 's love, and day by day her hate grew upon her, and she plotted and she planned how to get rid of her.

So one fine morning, fair and clear, she said to her sister, " Let us go and see our father 's boats come in at the bonny mill-stream of Binnorie." So they went there hand in hand . And when they got to the river's bank the youngest got upon a stone to watch for the coming of the boats. And her sister, coming behind her, caught her round the waist and dashed her into the rushing mill-stream of Binnorie.

" O sister, sister,reach me your hand !" she cried , as she floated away, " and you shall have half of all I've got or shall get."

" No, sister, I' ll reach you no hand of mine, for I am the heir to all your land . Shame on me if I touch the hand that has come 'twixt me and my own heart's love."

" O sister, O sister, then reach me your glove !" she cried , as she floated further away, " and you shall have your William again ."

" Sink on," cried the cruel princess, " no hand or glove of mine you'll touch. Sweet William will be all mine when you are sunk beneath the bonny mill-stream of Binnorie." And she turned and went home to the king's castle.

And the princess floated down the mill- stream , some times swimming and sometimes sinking, till she came near the mill. Now the miller's daughter was cooking that day,and needed water for her cooking. And as she went to draw it from the stream , she saw something floating
towards the mill-dam , and she called out, " Father ! father! draw your dam . There's something white - a merrymaid or a milk -white swan — coming down the stream ." So the miller hastened to the dam and stopped the heavy cruel mill-wheels. And then they took out the princess and laid her on the bank .

Fair and beautiful she looked as she lay there . In her golden hair were pearls and precious stones ; you could not see her waist for her golden girdle, and the golden fringe of her white dress came down over her lily feet.

But she was drowned , drowned !

And as she lay there in her beauty a famous harper passed by the mill-dam of Binnorie, and saw her sweet pale face. And though he travelled on far away he never forgot that face,and after many dayshe came back to the bonny mill-stream of Binnorie. But then all he could find of her where they had put her to rest were her bones and her golden hair. So he made a harp out of her breast-bone and her hair, and travelled on up the hill from the mill-dam of Binnorie, till he came to the castle of the king her father.

That night they were all gathered in the castle hall to hear the great harper — king and queen, their daughter and son , Sir William and all their Court. And first the harper sang to his old harp, making them joy and be glad or sorrow and weep just as he liked . But while he sang he put the harp he had made that day on a stone in the hall. And presently it began to sing by itself, low and clear, and the harper stopped and all were hushed .

And this was what the harp sung :

" O yonder sits my father, the king,  
Binnorie, O Binnorie ;  
And yonder sits mymother,the queen ;  
By the bonny mill-dams o' Binnorie,  
" And yonder standsmy brother Hugh,  
Binnorie , O Rinnorie ;  
And by him , my William , false and true ;  
By the bonny mill-damso ’ Binnorie."

Then they all wondered, and the harper told them how he had seen the princess lying drowned on the bank near the bonny mill-dams o' Binnorie, and how he had after wards made this harp out of her hair and breast-bone.

Just then the harp began singing again, and this was what it sang out loud and clear :

" And there sits my sister who drowned me  
By the bonny mill-dams o' Binnorie."

And the harp snapped and broke, and never sang more.

Source. — From the ballad of the "Twa Sisters o' Binnorie," I have used the longer version in Roberts's Legendary Ballads with one or two touches from Mr. Allingham's shorter and more powerful variant in The Ballad Book. A tale is the better for length, a ballad for its curtness.

Parallels. — The story is clearly that of Grimm's "Singing Bone" (No. 28), where one brother slays the other and buries him under a bush. Years after a shepherd passing by finds a bone under the bush, and, blowing through this, hears the bone denounce the murderer. For numerous variants in Ballads and Folk Tales, see Prof. Child's English and Scotch Ballads (ed. 1886), i. 125, 493 ; iii. 499.
