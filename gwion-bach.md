# Notes on Gwion Bach / Taliesin

The tale of Gwion Bach, his encounter with the sorceress Ceridwen, his rebirth as Taliesin, greatest of the bards, and his adventures with the luckless Prince Elphin, is one of my favourite tales.

THE MABINOGI OF TALIESIN.

INTRODUCTORY REMARKS.

In selecting the romance here submitted to your readers, as a farther specimen of the ancient tales I have it in contemplation to publish, I have been principally swayed by these two considerations ; the bringing forward a tale whose composer or adapter, and the period at which he flourished, are known,—and the elucidation of the era of some poetical pieces, which have been generally ascribed to Taliesin.

In these respects I deem this performance of interest ; for no other work of this description, that has come under my observation, can be appropriated with certainty to any determinate period ; nor can a more satisfactory clue to the reasons for composing poems in the names of celebrated characters be required.

The compiler, Hopkin Thomas Phillip, wrote this piece, about the year 1370. He lived in Morganweg, or Glamorgan; and his language is an interesting specimen of the Gwentian dialect, and an elegant model for prose composition. I, however, have reason to suspect that some of the poetical parts of this romance have been taken by him from some previous work of the same description, as the style and language would induce us to ascribe them to the twelfth and thirteenth centuries ; and some of them are attributed to Jonas Mynyw, or Jonas of Menevia, who appears to have lived at a period anterior to our author.

That this species of composition prevailed in Wales for many centuries we are well assured ; and we have an appropriate parallel to our present inquiry, in the declared intention of Geofry of Monmouth to embody the vaticinations of Merddin (Merlin) in a romance, which intention he afterwards relinquished, and published them in a poetical form, without the connecting narrative which he previously contemplated.

It is not unlikely some romance based upon the history of Taliesin, similar to the one under consideration, may have been known at the period of the first Norman lords of Glamorgen, and the language, by the lapse of time, may have become too obsolete for the facile comprehension of all classes ; and Hopkin Thomas Phillip may have modernized the narrative prose, and given the best version of the poetry he could procure. This surmise is strengthened by the very numerous copies we possess of these poetical pieces, some of which greatly differ from each other, apparently taken down from oral delivery of the tale by various reciters, and which could not well occur if the composition was the entire work of a person so late as the conclusion of the fourteenth century. (The Gaelic sgeulachds, or scholia, which accompany the old Gaelic poems attributed to Ossian, and described as containing the achievements of Fingal, &c., appear to have been similar in composition to tales of this description. )

Of the narrative part but one version exists, and therefore it requires no observation. Of the poetical portion, I have selected those readings which appeared to be the best, and admitted of the most consistent translation. Many of these poetical compositions have long been known and admired as most happy efforts in the Welsh language; and the author, though unknown, as it is not consistent with probability to attribute them to any person anterior to the twelfth century, nor so late as the close of the fourteenth, must rank high among those gifted men who have been the most successful votaries of the British *awen*, (poetical inspiration.) These pieces, beautiful as they are, we must arrange in their proper rank, reject them as historical documents, and discard them as the genuine compositions of Taliesin, the
bard of Urien Reged and Rhun.

The editors of the Myvyrian Archaiology were bound to give to the world all the pieces, whatever their origin, which were ascribed to the poets whose works were comprised in that collection, leaving it to the critic to elucidate the various styles, and pronounce upon the authenticity of the productions— this department was not within the scope of their undertaking, but it would afford a highly interesting inquiry, judiciously to investigate our ancient remains, as far as possible ascribe them to their proper era, and discriminate between the materials of sober history and splendid fiction.

With these introductory remarks, I enclose for your pages a translation of the Mabinogi, or tale of Taliesin.

IDRISON.

THE MABINOGI TALE OF TALIESIN.

There was a nobleman in former times, of Penllyn, who was called Tegid the Bald, and his patrimony was in the middle of the lake of Tegid `[This lake is near the town of Bala. in Meirion.]`; and his married wife was called Keridwen `[The fair procreator: in the bardic mythology, an epithet for the first woman; and she was feigned to be the mother of Morvran ab Tegid, who escaped from the battle of Camlan, owing to his hideous form ; and Sandde, of angel aspect, escaped by a way being made from his being taken for an angel; and Glewlwyd of the mighty grasp, escaped, as no foe dared to stand in his way. These three were the representatives of ugliness, beauty, and strength]`, and of that wife a son was born named Morvran ab Tegid, and a daughter named Creirvyw, who was the fairest damsel in the world, and a brother of theirs was the ugliest person among men, and this was Avagddu.

Then Keridwen, the mother of Avagddu, considered it as not likely that he should have reception among the nobility, from his being so ugly, unless he were endowed with some pre-eminent gifts or sciences; for this was at the commencement of the era of Arthur and the round table

And thereupon, by having recourse to books of chemistry, she prepared to concoct a cauldron of genius and sciences for her son, so that his reception might be more honourable, on account of his sciences, and his knowledge in respect to the future state of the world.

So she began to boil the cauldron, the which, after it should be made to boil, could not be suffered to leave off boiling until the end of a year and a day, so that three blessed drops should be obtained through the grace of the spirit. And little Gwion, the son of a yeoman of Llanvair Caereinion, in Powys, was placed by her to attend the cauldron, and a blind man named Morda to keep up the fire under it, with a command not to suffer the boil to break until a year and a day should elapse ; and she also, through the books of the astronomers, and by the hours of the planets, being daily collecting of such various herbs as had some peculiar virtue.

And on a certain day, as Keridwen was collecting herbs, and the end of the year drawing near, three drops of the pure water flew out of the cauldron, and lighted upon the finger of little Gwion: and, from its being so hot, at the instant he put those those precious drops into his mouth, and no sooner had he done so, than he obtained a knowledge of every thing that might occur in future : and he was thus forewarned that his principal care must be to avoid the wiles of Keridwen, for her inventive powers were great, and out of extreme fear he fled towards his own country ; and the cauldron was broken in two, because the whole of the steel was of a deleterious nature, except those three precious drops, and thus the steeds of Gwyddno Longshank were poisoned by drinking of the water from the brook into which the cauldron ran, and  therefore the brook thenceforth was called the poison of Gwyddno's horses. And thereupon Keridwen was observed returning home, and seeing her labour for a twelvemonth lost, she snatched up a billet, and struck the blind Morda upon his head, so that one of his eyes fell down his cheek ; whereupon he then said, "badly hast thou disfigured me, and I being innocent! thou hast suffered no loss on my account." "Thou hast spoken the truth," said Keridwen, " it was little Gwion that robbed me;" and so she followed him upon a run. And thereupon he observed her, and so he changed himself into the form of a hare, and ran off; then she also appeared as a hound bitch, doubled him, and turned him towards a river; and then he appeared as a fish, and she also in the form of an otter bitch, and pursued him under the water; so that he was compelled to appear as a bird in the air, and she as a hawk to pursue him, and so gave him no quiet in the air; and as she was overtaking him, and he having the fear of death upon him, he observed a heap of winnowed wheat on a barn floor, and so alighted into the wheat, and appeared in the form of one of the grains, and thereupon she also appeared as a black crested hen, and into the wheat she went, which, scratching with her feet, she recognized him, and swallowed him: and, as said in the narrative, she was nine months pregnant of him; and, after her delivery, she could not in her heart kill him, so beautiful he seemed, but she wrapped him in a leathern bag, and cast him to the will of man into the sea, on the 29th of April.

And at that time Gwyddno had a wear on the sand between Dyvi and Aberystwyth, near to his own castle; and in that wear there was obtained to the value of a hundred pounds at every May eve. At that time, Gwyddno had one son, who was called Elphin, being one of the most untoward of youths, and suffering the createst privation, which was a cause of grief to his father, fearing that he was born in an evil hour: and through the advice of his counsellors, his father gave him the drought of the wear for that year, to see if ever any luck befel him, and to make a beginning of employment for him.

The following morning, as Elphin was examining the wear, and finding there was nothing in it, was going away, he discovered a leathern bag suspended from a pole of the wear; then one of the wear men said to Elphin, "Thou hast never been unfortunate before this night, for thou hast broken the virtues of the wear, wherein there used to be obtained the value of a hundred pounds on every May eve."

" Now," said Elphin, " what if there might be an equivalent to the hundred pounds in this ?"

The skin was untied, and the opener of it saw the forehead of a boy, and he exclaimed, "See, here is a fair front !"

"Fair Front [i.e. Taliesin] let his name be," said Elphin, raising him up between his hands, bewailing his misfortune, and pensively placed him in a pannier on one of his horses, and at the instant he made the horse canter that only trotted before, thus conducting him so softly as if he were sitting in the easiest chair that possibly could be, and thus carrying the boy, composed the verses called "The Consolation of Elphin," with an eulogy, anda prophecy of honourable advancement to him; and the Consolation was the first song made by Taliesin, and which was to console Elphin on the way home as he sorrowed at the loss of the drought of the wear ; and above all he was concerned that the fault and misfortune were attributed to him. The Consolation was to this effect :

Fair Elphin cease to lament!  
Let no one be dissatisfied with his own,  
To despair will bring no advantage.  
No man sees what supports him;  
The prayer of Cynllo will not be in vain;  
God will not violate his promise.  
Never in Gwyddno's wear  
Was there such good luck as this night.

Fair Elphin, dry thy cheeks!  
Although thou thinkest thou hast no gain,  
Too much grief will bring thee no good:  
Nor doubt the miracles of the Almighty:  
Although I am but little, I am highly gifted.  
From seas, and from mountains,
And from the depths of rivers,  
God brings wealth to the fortunate man.

Elphin of lively qualities,
Thy resolution is unmanly ;  
Thou must not be over sorrowful:  
Better to trust in God than to forbode ill.  
Weak and small as I am,  
On the foaming beach of the ocean,  
In the day of trouble, I shall be  
Of more service to thee than 300 salmon.

Elphin of notable qualities,  
Be not displeased at thy misfortune;  
Although reclined thus weak in my bag,  
There lies a virtue in my tongue.  
While I continue thy protector  
Thou hast not much to fear:  
Remembering the names of the Trinity,  
None shall be able to harm thee.

The foregoing, with various other verses were sung by Taliesin for the comfort of Elphin, during his journey, who, on arriving at home, presented the contents of the pannier to his wife, who nursed the child dearly and tenderly.

From that time forward the wealth of Elphin increased more and more day after day, and he obtained the favour and love of the king; who, some short time afterwards, kept open court in Christmas time at the castle of Dyganwy, surrounded by his lords, both spiritual and temporal, with a great number of knights and esquires. `[This was Maelewn, who reigned A.D. 517 to A.D. 654.]`

In this assembly the following conversation took place : "Is there in the whole world a king so powerful as Maelgwn, and so endowed by heaven with spiritual gifts? In the first lace, comliness of person, and urbanity, and strength, besides all the energies of the soul ; and along with these gifts, they say, the Father has bestowed upon him one eminent gift that is superior to the others altogether, which is, happiness in having a queen whose form and demeanour, and wisdom, and chastity, are qualities possessed by her in a higher degree than by all the noble ladies in the kingdom."

Besides this subject, they threw out questions amongst themselves, as to who was the bravest of his men; who had the finest and swiftest horses and greyhounds; who had better informed and wiser bards than Maelgwn. These were at the time in great esteem amongst the dignitaries of the kingdom; and at that time none were advanced to the office at present called a herald, except such as were learned men; and not only were they employed in the service of kings and princes, but were required to be well versed in genealogies, armorial bearings, and the deeds of kings and princes, as well in respect to foreign kingdoms as to the elders of these kingdoms; and particularly as to the history of the principal nobility. It was necessary also, for all of them to be most ready with their answers in the several languages of Latin, French, Welsh, and English; and, in addition to this, to be great historians, and to be of good memory, and accomplished in poetry, so as readily to compose metrical verses in each of those languages.

And of these there were at the court of Maelgwn, during that festival, as many as four and twenty; and chief over them was one who was called Heinin the Bard.

Thus, after all had extolled the king, and enumerated his virtues, it happened that Elphin should express himself in this manner :

"Truly, no one is able to compete with a king but a king ; however, let that be granted, and indeed if he were not a king, I might say that I have a wife equal in respect to personal chastity to any lady that can be found in the kingdom. And besides, I have one bard who is better informed than all the bards of the king."

In a little time the king was informed of all the boasting of Elphin by some of his companions, for which the king commanded him to be confined in a strong prison, until he should be enabled to obtain true information in respect to the chastity of his wife, and also in respect to the talents of his bard.

Then, after Elphin had been placed in a tower of the castle, with heavy fetters on his legs, which fetters were said to be of silver, on account of his being of royal blood, the account shows that the king employed Rhun, his son, to prove the chastity of the wife of Elphin, which Rhun was one of the most lascivious characters that ever lived; for neither wife nor maiden escaped free from imputation, with whom he obtained but a short space for discourse.

And as Rhun was coming in great haste towards the mansion of Elphin, with full intention to debauch his wife, Taliesin told his mistress what he had long observed, from the conduct of the king in confining his master, and the way that Rhun had come with the design of assailing her chastity; and therefore he advised his mistress to dress one of the maids of the kitchen in her clothes. This the lady gladly complied with unsparingly, by ornamenting her hands with a profusion of the choicest rings in the possession of herself and her husband. In this manner Taliesin directed his mistress to place the maid to sit at the table in her stead to supper, and Taliesin contrived to make her appear like her mistress, and the mistress to be like the maid.

Thus as they were seated in the most sumptuous style at supper, as has been described, Rhun suddenly appeared at the hall of Elphin, and was joyfully ushered in, for all the attendants knew him well; and they quickly introduced him into the room to their mistress, in whose resemblance the maid got up from the supper, and politely welcomed him; and afterwards she again sat to supper, Rhun being seated along with her ; and presently he began to joke with obscene expressions with the maid, who studied to preserve the semblance of her mistress: and indeed, the narrative shows that the maid became so inebriated as to begin to fall asleep ; and it is also stated that Rhun infused some powders in her drink, which caused her to sleep so soundly, as not at all to feel his cutting her little finger off her hand, on which was a ring with the signet of Elphin, which he had sent as a token of his wife a little while before. In this manner he did whatever he thought proper to the girl; and then he took the finger with the ring round it, as a token for the king of his having succeeded, by showing the manner how he had cut off her finger on leaving her, without her being awaked out of her sleep.

From these reports the king was greatly delighted; and in consequence he sent for his council, to whom he explained the whole of the matter, from beginning to end: also commanding Elphin to be brought from the prison, that he might be reprimanded for his boasting ; and thereupon he addressed Elpbin in this manner:

"Elphin, be it known to thee, and doubt thou not, that it is but folly for any man in the world to believe a woman in respect to her personal chastity, farther than he may be able to observe her; and that thou mayest ascertain how thy wife broke her marriage vow the very night last past, behold, here is her finger as a proof for thee, with thy signet ring round it, which was cut from her hand in her sleep, by the person that slept with her ; so that, as thou mayest not have to boast by saying she had not transgressed in respect to her chastity."

To these words E!phin replied in the following manner: "By thy permission, honourable king, permit me to say, that I am by no means able to deny my ring for there are many people he can identify it; but, in truth, I solemnly assert that the finger round which it is was never joined to the hand of my wife ; for, in certain truth, it has upon it three particular things, not any one of which was ever upon either of the fingers of the hands of my wife, and the first of the three is conclusive, by the leave of your grace, wheresoever my wife may at present be, whether sitting, or standing, or lying down, this ring will not stick even upon her thumb; and you may plainly observe, it must be difficult to force this ring over the joint of the smallest finger of the hand from which this finger was taken; and the second thing is, that my wife has not been on any Saturday, since I have known her, without having her nails pared before going to bed; and, indeed, you can plainly see that the nail of this finger has not been cut for a month; and the third thing is this, that the hand from which this finger has been cut has kneeded some dough of rye within the three days prior to this finger being cut off it; and I will confirm it as true to your goodness, that my wife has not kneeded rye dough since she has been a wife to me."

Then the king became extremely angry with Elphin for standing out so stoutly against him on behalf of the chastity of his wife; and on that account the king commanded him the second time to prison, saying that he should not be liberated from thence, until he proved his boasting to be true, as well in respect to the talent of his bard as to the purity of his wife: these were during the time in the palace of Elphin, making merry; and, in the meanwhile, Taliesin informed his mistress how Elphin was in prison on their account; but he desired her to appear cheerful, and explained to her the manner he would go to the court of Maelgwn to liberate his master. Thereupon she inquired by what means he would free his master; and then he replied in this manner:

" A journey will I perform,  
And to the gate [ will come ;  
The hall I will enter,  
And my song I will sing  
My speech I will pronounce  
To silence royal bards.  
In presence of their chief,  
I will greet to deride,  
Upon them I will break,  
And Elphin I will free.  
Should contention arise,  
In presence of the prince,  
With summons to the bards  
For the sweet-flowing song,  
And wizards' posing lore  
And wisdom of Druids.

In the court of the sons of the distributer  
Some are who did appear  
Intent on wily schemes,  
By craft and tricking means,  
In pangs of affliction  
To wrong the innocent.  
Let the fools be silent,  
As erst in Badon's fight,—  
With Arthur of liberal ones  
The head, with long red blades ;  
Through feats of testy men,  
And a chief with his foes.  
Woe be to them, the fools,  
When revenge comes on them.

I, Taliesin, chief of bards,  
With sapient druids' words,  
Will set kind Elphin free  
From haughty tyrant's bonds.  
To their fell and chilling cry,  
By the act of a surprising steed,  
From the far distant North,  
There soon shall be an end,  
Let neither grace nor health  
Be to Maelgwn Gwynedd,  
For this force and this wrong ;  
And be extremes of ills  
And an avenged end  
To Rhun and all his race:  
Short be his course of life,  
Be all his lands laid waste;  
And long exile be assigned  
To Maelgwn Gwynedd !"

Having spoken thus, Taliesin took leave of his mistress; and at length he arrived at the court of Maelgwn, who, in royal state, was about entering the hall to dinner, in the manner usual with kings and princes, on every high festival in that age. And just as Taliesin had come into the hall, he observed there was room for him in an unfrequented place near where the bards and minstrels were wont to repair to perform their service and devotion to the king, as is still customary in proclaiming largess upon high festivals.

So the time was now arrived for the bards or the heralds to proclaim the largess and liberality of the king; and these came towards the place where Taliesin was squatting in a corner, who stretched out his lip after them, and on it he played "blab blab" with his finger ; they took not much notice of him in passing, but walked on till they came before the king, to whom they made their obeysance with their bodies, as it was proper for them to do, without uttering a single word, but extending out their lips and mouthing at the king, playing "blab blab" with their fingers and lips, as they had seen the boy doing before, which sight filled the king with wonder and amazement, supposing them to be drunk, owing to a profusion of liquors ; therefore he desired one of the lords that ministered at his table to go to them, to request that they would call to mind where they were standing, and how they ought to conduct themselves. This he did with pleasure; but they were not prevailed upon to desist from their folly. On that account, he sent the second and the third time, and ordered them to leave the hall. At length the king desired one of the 'squires to give a blow to the chief of them, who was called Heinin the Bard; then the 'squire took a broom and struck him on his head so that he fell back on his breech, whence he got up on his knees, and then he besought the king's grace for permission to show him that such inadvertence did not arise from neglect, nor from want of thought, nor from ebriety, but from the power of some spirit that was within the hall; and in addition to this Heinin spoke as follows :

"Illustrious king, be it known to your grace, it is not from the effect of a profusion of liquors that we are dumb, and seem as drunken men, but through the impulse of a spirit sitting in yonder corner in the form of a child."

From that spot the king commanded a 'squire to fetch him, and who went into the corner where Taliesin was sitting, and thence brought him into the presence of the king, who asked him what he was, and from whence he came. Then Taliesin answered him satirically, as is seen here.—

THE MABINOGI OF TALIESIN.
( Continued from the Cambrian Quarterly for April. )

NOTICES OF THE POWERS OF THE BARD.

In water there is a quality endowed with a blessing ; on God it is most just to meditate aright ; to God it is proper to supplicate with seriousness, since no obstacle can there be to obtain a reward from him.

Three times have I been born, I know by meditation; it were miserable for a person not to come and obtain all the sciences of the world, collected together in my breast, for I know what has been, what in future will occur.

I will supplicate my Lord that I get a refuge in him, a regard I may obtain in his grace; the Son of Mary is my trust, great in him is my delight, for in him is the world continually upholden.

God has been to instruct me and to raise my expectation, the true Creator of heaven, who affords me protection; it is rightly intended that the saints should daily pray, for God, the renovator, will bring them to him.

A CHALLENGE TO THE BARDS OF MAELGON.

Is it not natural to be excited  
by the allurement of praise ;


TO DO


p372

I have been on the White Hill,  
in the court of Cynvelyn,  
in stocks and fetters  
for a day and a year.  
I have been a teacher  
to the whole universe;  
I shall be until the day of doom  
on the face of the earth;  
my body it will not be known  
whether flesh or fish.  
I have been in an easy chair  
above the ecliptic,  
and this revolves  
between three elements ;  
then I was for nine months  
in the womb of the hag Ceridwen ;  
I was originally little Gwion,  
and at length I am Taliesin.  

When this composition was made known to the king and his nobles, they became greatly surprised; for they heard not from the mouth of a boy so little any thing that could be compared to this song. And when his majesty knew that its author was the bard of Elphin, he ordered Heinin, his chief and wisest bard, to bring an answer to Taliesin, and to contend with him. But he, on coming forward, could only play blab blab with his lip; and, when the four and twenty other bards were sent for, they did the same thing, and they could not do otherwise. Thereupon Maelgwn asked Taliesin what might be his errand there; and so the other answered in verse in this manner:

Puny bards, I am trying to secure the prize, if I can ;  
by a gentle prophetic strain  
I am endeavouring to retrieve  
the loss I may have suffered ;  
complete the attempt, I hope,  
since Elphin endures trouble  
in the fortress of Teganwy. `[The ruins of the fort of Teganwy : here are still some remains of it on the northern side of the estuary of the Conwy river.]`
His confinement may not be over much,  
strengthened by my muse I am powerful ;  
mighty on my part is what I seek ;  
for, three hundred songs and more,  
are combined in the spell I sing.  
There ought not to stand where I am  
neither stone and neither ring ;  
that there ought not to be about me  
not any bard who may not know  
that Elphin son of Gwyddno  
is in the land of Artro, `[A small estuary, two miles south of Harleg, in Meirion.]`
secured by thirteen locks,  
for praising his instructor :  
and then I Taliesin,  
chief of the bards of the west,  
shall loosen Elphin  
out of a golden fetter.

As Taliesin was thus reciting his composition at the gate, there arose such a storm of wind, that the king and all his nobles thought the castle would fall on their heads; and thereupon the king ordered Elphin to be hastily brought out of prison, and that he might be placed before Taliesin; and immediately it is said that Taliesin sang a song, so that the fetters opened from about the legs of Elphin.

After this he sang a prelude, that is called the master-piece of the bards, as it follows here.

p376

After Taliesin had delivered his lord out of prison, and asserted the chastity of his mistress, and silenced the bards, so that not any one of them dared to utter a single word, he requested of Elphin, that he would make a wager with the king of his possessing a horse swifter than all the horses of his majesty; and this was done by Elphin; and the day, the time, and the place were fixed upon and the spot is to this day called Morva Rhianedd, or sea-marsh of the Maidens. `[This is about three miles from Conwy, on the coast towards Abergeleu.]` So the king and his retinue came there, with twenty-four horses, the swiftest that were in his possession. And on the spot, after a long examination, the course was marked out, and the horses were appointed to run. To that place likewise came Taliesin, bringing with him twenty-four holly rods, made black by charring, and which he ordered the boy who rode the horse of his master to put in his girdle, with giving him directions to let all the horses of the king go before him; and as he could overtake them, each one after the other, he was to take one of the rods, and to give a stroke across the crupper of the horse; and after that he was to take another rod; and thus he did in like manner to all the horses, as he could overtake them, giving a strict command to the rider to watch carefully on what spot the horse might fall, and so put his cap down in that spot. All this was accomplished by the boy, as well in giving a stroke to each one of the king's horses, and of putting his cap down on the spot where the horse fell; and to the place Taliesin brought his master, after his horse had won the ace, and he ordered Elphin to put men at work to dig a pit. In this spot, after they had dug out the earth to a considerable depth, they found a large cauldron, which was full of gold, and at the time Taliesin said,

"Elphin, this is as payment and reward for bringing me out of the wear, and for nursing me from that time to this day.

On the spot where what is spoken of above was performed there is a pool of water, which is called to this day, the pool cauldron.

After that the king ordered Taliesin to be brought before him: and of him he asked for information concerning the beginning of the human race; and thereupon Taliesin composed the prelude, which at this day is called one of the four canons of song, and it begins thus:

Taliesin afterwards recited various predictions, in verse, to the king, as to the future events in the world, which are given in the collection entitled the Primitive Bards.

Out of the book of Iolo Morganwg, being the collection of Hopkin T. Phylip of Glamorgan; made about A.D. 1370.

As the "various predictions" alluded to above contain no particulars of the history of Taliesin himself, his Mabinogi may properly terminate here.

It may be an useful illustration to point out where the principal scenes of this Mabinogi were acted; and this we are enabled to do from their names being still preserved by tradition, in the localities where they occurred.

There is a lake called *Llyn Pair*, or pool of the cauldron, about three miles from Towyn, on the old Macynilaith road through the mountains; the outlet of this lake is among large rocks, and the stream falls into a black pool below, and thence runs into the sea by *Bottalog*; and where it runs through the low ground, it abounds with the water hemlock. In the Mabinogi the name of the river is *Gwenwyn meirç Gwyddno, the poison of Gwyddno's horses*, though its present name is *Avon Llyn y Pair*. About a mile from this lake there is a farm retaining the name of *Gwydd Gwion*, or Gwion wood, from a personage so called in the tale. Three or four miles in the sea, between the outlets of the rivers *Ystwyth* and *Teivi*, are the remains of the fort of Gwyddno, the father of Elphin, and is well known to the people on the neighbouring coast. In the summer of 1770, I sailed over the ruins, in a very calm day, and thus for about three minutes, I had a clear view of them, appearing about twelve feet below the surface of the water; and many of the stones seemed to be large slabs, and lying in confusion on the heap.

IN times past there lived in Penllyn a man of gentle lineage, named Tegid Voel, and his dwelling was in the midst of the lake Tegid, aud his wife was called Caridwen. And there was born to him of his wife a son named Morvran ab Tegid., and also a daughter named Creirwy, the fairest maiden in the world was she; aud they had a brother, the most ill-favoured man in the world, Avagddu. Now Caridwen his mother thought that he was not likely to be admitted among men of noble birth, by reason of his ugliness, unless he had some exalted merits or knowledge. For it was in the beginning of Arthur's time and of the Round Table.

So she resolved according to the arts of the books of the Fferyllt, to boil a cauldron of Inspiration and Science for her son, that his reception might be honourable because of his knowledge of the-mysteries of the future state of tbe world.

Then she began to boil the cauldron, which from the beginning of its boiling might not cease to boil for a year and a day, until three blessed drops were obtained of the grace of inspiration.

And she put Gwion Bach the son of Gwreang of Llanfair in Caereinion, in Powys, to stir the cauldron, and a blind man named Morda to kindle the fire beneath it, and she charged them that they should not suffer it to cease boiling for the space of a year and a day. And she herself, according to the books of the astronomers, and in planetary hours, gathered every day of all charm-bearing herbs. And one day, towards the end of the year, as Caridwen was culling plants and making incantations, it chanced that three drops of the charmed liquor flew out of the cauldron and fell upon the finger of Gwion Bach. And by reason of their great heat he put his finger to his mouth, and the instant he put those marvel-working drops into his mouth, he foresaw every thing that was to come, and perceived that his chief care must be to guard against the wiles of Caridwen, for vast was her skill. And in very great fear he fled towards his own land. And the cauldron burst in two, because all the liquor vrithin it except the three charm-bearing drops was poisonous, so that the horses of Gwyddno Garanhir were poisoned by the water of the stream into which the liquor of the cauldron ran, and the confluence of that stream was called the Poison of the Horses of Gwyddno from that time forth.

Thereupon came in Caridwen and saw all the toil of the whole year lost And she seized a billet of wood and struck the blind Morda on the head until one of his eyes fell out upon his cheek. And he said, " Wrongfully hast thou disfigured me, for I am innocent. Thy loss was not because of me." "Thou speakest truth," said Caridwen, "it was Gwion Bach who robbed me."

And she went forth after him, running. And be saw her, and changed himself into a hare and fled. But she changed herself into a greyhound and turned him. And he ran towards a river, and became a fish. And she in the form of an otter-bitch chased him under the water, until he was fain to turn himself into a bird of the air. Then she, as a hawk, followed him and gave him no rest in the sky. And just as she was about to stoop upon him, and he was in fear of death, he espied a heap of winnowed wheat on the floor of a barn, and he dropped amongst the wheat, and turned himself into one of the grains. Then she transformed herself into a high-crested black hen, and went to the wheat and scratched it with her feet, and found him out and swallowed him. And, as the story says, she bore him nine months, and when she was delivered of him, she could not find it in her heart to kill him, by reason of his beauty. So she wrapped him in a leathern bag, and cast him into the sea to the mercy of God, on the twenty-ninth day of April.

And at that time the weir of Gwyddno was on the strand between Dyvi and Aberystwyth, near to his own castle, and the value of an hundred pounds was taken in that weir every May eve. And in those days Gwyddno had an only son named Elphin, the most hapless of youths, and the most needy. And it grieved his father sore, for he thought that he was born in an evil hour. And by the advice of his council, his father had granted him the drawing of the weir that year, to see if good luck would ever befal him, and to giye him something wherewith to begin the world.

And the next day, when Elphin went to look, there was nothing in the weir. But as he turned back he perceived the leathern bag upon a pole of the weir. Then said one of the weir-ward unto Elphin, "Thou wast never unlucky until to-night, and now thou hast destroyed the virtues of the weir, which always yielded the value of an hundred pounds every May eve, and to-night there is nothing but this leathern skin within it." "How now," said Elphin, "there may be therein the value of an hundred pounds." Well! they took up the leathern bag, and he who opened it saw the forehead of the boy, and said to Elphin, "Behold a radiant brow!" "Taliesin be he called," said Elphin. And he lifted the boy in his arms, and lamenting his mischance, he placed him sorrowfully behind him. And he made his horse amble gently, that before had been trotting, and he carried him as softly as if he had been sitting in the easiest chair in the world. And presently the boy made a Consolation and praise to Elphin, and foretold honour to Elphin; and the Consolation was as you may see,


"Fair Elphin cease to lament !  
Let no one be dissatafied with his own.  
To despair will bring no advantage.  
No man sees what supports him;  
The prayer of Clynllo will not be in vain;  
God will not violate his promise.  
Never in Gwyddno's weir  
Was there snch good luck as this night  
Fair Elphin, dry thy cheeks !  
Being too sad will not avail,  
Although thou thinkest thou hast no gain  
Too much grief will bring thee no good ;  
Nor doubt the miracles of the Almighty:  
Although I am but little, I am highly gifted.  
From seas, and from mountains.  
And from the depths of rivers,  
God brings wealth to the fortunate man.  
Elphin of lively qualities.  
Thy resolution is unmanly ;  
Thou must not be over sorrowful :  
Better to trust in God than to forbode ill.  
Weak and small as I am.  
On the foaming beach of the ocean.  
In the day of trouble, I shall be  
Of more service to thee than 900 salmon.  
Elphin of notable qualities.  
Be not displeased at thy misfortune ;  
Although reclined thus weak in my bag.  
There lies a virtue in my tongue.  
While I continue thy protector  
Thou hast not much to fear ;  
Remembering the names of the Trinity,  
None shall be able to harm thee."

And this was the first poem that Taliesin ever sang, being to console Elphin in his grief for that the produce of the weir was lost, and, what was worst that all the world would consider that it was through his fault and ill-luck. And then Gwyddno Garanhir `[This should be Elphin son of Gwyddno, see page 326.]` asked him what he was, whether man or spirit. Whereupon he sang this tale, and said,

"First, I have been formed a comely person,  
In the court of Caridwen I have done penance ;  
Though little I was seen, placidly received,  
I was great on the floor of the place to where I was led;  
I have been a prized defence, the sweet muse the cause,  
And by law without speech I have been liberated  
By a smiling black old hag, when irritated  
Dreadful her claim when pursued:  
I have fled with vigour, I have fled as a frog,  
I have fled in the semblance of a crow, scarcely finding rest ;  
I have fled vehemently, I have fled as a chain,  
I have fled as a roe into an entangled thicket;  
I have fled as a wolf cub, I have fled as a wolf in a wilderness,  
I have fled as a thrush of portending language;  
I have fled as a fox, used to concurrent bounds of quirks;  
I have fled as a martin, which did not avail:  
I have fled as a squirrel, that vainly hides,  
I have fled as a stages antler, of ruddy course,  
I have fled as iron in a glowing fire,  
I have fled as a spear-head, of woe to such as has a wish for it;  
I have fled as a fierce bull bitterly fighting,  
I have fled as a bristly boar soon in a ravine,  
I have fled as a white grain of pure wheat,  
On the skirt of a hempen sheet entangled,  
That seemed of the size of a mare's foal,  
That is filling like a ship on the waters ;  
Into a dark leathern bag I was thrown,  
And on a boundless sea I was sent adrift;  
Which was to me an omen of being tenderly nnrsed.  
And the Lord God then set me at liberty."

Then came Elphin to the house or court of Gwyddno his father, and Taliesin with him. And Gwyddno asked him if he had had a good haul at the weir, and he told him that he had got that which was better than fish. "What was that?" said Gwyddno. "A Bard," answered Elphin. Then said Gwyddno, "Alas, what will he profit thee!" And Taliesin himself replied and said, "He will profit him more than the weir ever profited thee." Asked Gwyddno, "Art thou able to speak, and thou so little ?" And Taliesm answered him, "I am better able to speak than thou to question me." " Let me hear what thou canst say," quoth Gwyddno. Then Taliesin sang, —

"In water there is a quality endowed with a blessing;  
On God it is most just to meditate aright;  
To God it is proper to supplicate with seriousness,  
Since no obstacle can there be to obtain a reward from him.  
Three times have I been born, I know by meditation;  
It were miserable for a person not to come and obtain  
All the sciences of the world, collected together in my breast,  
For I know what has been, what in future will occur.  
I will supplicate my Lord that I got refuge in him,  
A regard I may obtain in his grace;  
The Son of mary is my trust, great in him is my delight,  
For in him is the world continuallu upholden.  
God has been to instruct me and to raise my expectation,  
The true Creator of heaven, wbo affords me protection;  
It is rightly intended that the saints should daily pray,  
For God, the renovator, will bring them to him."

And forthwith Elphin gave his haul to his wife, and she nursed him tenderly and lovingly. Thenceforward Elphin encreased in riches more and more day after day, and in love and favour with the king, and there abode Taliesin until he was thirteen years old, when Elphin son of Gwyddno went by a Christmas invitation to his uncle, Maelgwn Gwynedd, who sometime after this held open court at Christmas-tide in the castle of Dyganwy, for all the number of his lords of both degrees, both spiritual and temporal, with a vast and thronged host of knights and squires. And amongst them there arose a discourse and discussion. And thus was it said.

"Is there in the whole world a king so great as Maelgwn, or one on whom Heaven has bestowed so many spiritual gifts as upon him? First, form, and beauty, and meekness, and strength, besides all the powers of the soul?" And together with these they said that Heaven had given one gift that exceeded all the others, which was the beauty, and comeliness, and grace, and wisdom, and modesty of his queen; whose virtues surpassed those of all the ladies and noble maidens through- out the whole kingdom. And with this they put questions one to another amongst themselves. Who had braver men? Who had fairer or swifter horses or greyhounds? Who had more skilful or wiser bards — than Maelgwn?

Now at that time the bards were in great favour with the exalted of the kingdom; and then none performed the office of those who are now called heralds, unless they were learned men, not only expert in the service of kings and princes, but studious and well versed in the lineage, and arms, and exploits of princes and kings, and in discussions concerning foreign kingdoms, and the ancient things of this kingdom, and chiefly in the annals of the first nobles; and also were prepared always with their answers in various languages, Latin, French, Welsh, and English. And together with this they were great chroniclers, and recorders, and skilful in framing verses, and ready in making englyns in every one of these languages. Now of these there were at that feast within the palace of Mae gwn as many as four and twenty, and . chief of them all, was one named Heinin Vardd.

When they had all made an end of thus praising the king and his gifts, it befel that Elphin spoke on this wise. "Of a truth none but a king may vie with a king; but were he not a king, I would say that my wife was as virtuous as any lady in the kingdom, and also that I have a bard who is more skilful than all the king's bards." In a short space some of his fellows shewed the king all the boastings of Elphin; and the king ordered him to be thrown into a strong prison, until be might know the truth as to the virtues of his, wife, and the wisdom of his bard.

Now when Elphin had been put in a tower of the castle, with a thick chain about his feet, (it is said that it was a silver chain, because he was of royal blood;) the king, as the story relates, sent his son Rhun to enquire into the demeanour of Elphin's wife. Now Rhun was the most graceless man in the world, and there was neither wife nor maiden with whom he had held converse, but was evil spoken of. While Rhun went in haste towards Elphin's dwelling, being fully minded to bring disgrace upon his wife, Taliesin told his mistress how that the king had placed his master in durance in prison, and how that Rhun was coming in haste ta strive to bring disgrace upon her. Wherefore he caused his mistress to array one of the maids of her kitchen in her apparel ; which the noble lady gladly did; and she loaded her hands with the best rings that she and her husband possessed.

In this guise Taliesin caused his mistress to put the maiden to sit at the board in her room at supper, and he made her to seem as her mistress, and the mistress to seem as the maid. And when they were in due time seated at their supper in the manner that has been said, Rhun suddenly arrived at Elphin^s dwelling, and was received with joy, for all the servants knew him plainly; and they brought him in haste to the room of their mistress, in the semblance of whom the maid rose up from supper and welcoined him gladly. And afterwards she sat down to supper again the second time, and Rhun with her. Then Rhun began jesting with the maid, who still kept the semblance of her mistress. And verily this story shews that the maiden became so intoxicated, that she fell asleep; and the story relates that it was a powder that Rhun put into the drink, that made her sleep so soundly that she never felt it when he cut from off her hand her little finger, whereon was the signet ring of Elphin, which he had sent to his wife as a token, a short time before. And Rhun returned to the king with the finger and the ring as a proof to shew that he had cut it from off her hand, without her awaking from her sleep of intemperance.

The king rejoiced greatly at these tidings, and he sent for his councillors, to whom he told the whole story from the beginning. And he caused Elphin to be brought out of his prison, and he chided him because of his boast. And he spake unto Elphin on this wise. "Elphin, be it known to thee beyopd a doubt that it is but folly for a man to trust in the virtues of his wife further than he can see her; and that thou mayest be certain of thy wife's vileness, behold her finger, with thy signet ring upon it, which was cut from her hand last night, while she slept the sleep of intoxication." Then thus spake Elphin. "With thy leave, mighty king, I cannot deny my ring, for it is known of many; but verily I assert strongly that the finger around which it is, was never attached to the hand of my wife, for in truth and certainty there are three notable things pertaining to it, none of which ever belonged to any of my wife's fingers. The first of the three is, that it is certain, by your grace's leave, that wheresoever my wife is at this present hour, whether sitting, or standing, or lying down, this ring would never remain upon her thumb, whereas you can plainly see that it was hard to draw it over the joint of the little finger of the hand whence this was cut; the second thing is, that my wife has never let pass one Saturday since I have known her without paring her nails before going to bed, and you can see fully that the nail of this little finger has not been pared for a month. The third is, truly, that the hand whence this finger came was kneading rye dough within three days before the finger was cut therefrom, and I can assure your goodness that my wife has never kneaded rye dough since my wife she has been."

Then the king was mightily wrath with Elphin for so stoutly withstanding him, respecting the goodness of his wife, wherefore he ordered him to his prison a second time, saying that he should not be loosed thence until he had proved the truth of his boast, as well concerning the wisdom of his bard as the virtues of his wife.

In the meantime his wife and Taliesin remained joyful at Elphin's dwelling. And Taliesin shewed his mistress how that Elphin was in prison because of them, but he bade her be glad for that he would go to Maelgwn's court to free his master. Then she asked him in what manner he would set him free. And he answered her—

A journey I will perform,  
And to the gate I will come;  
The hall I will enter,  
And my song I will sing;  
My speech I will pronounce  
To silence royal bards.  
In presence of their chief,  
I will greet to deride,  
Upon them I will break  
And Elphin I will free.  
Should contention arise,  
In presence of the prince,  
With summons to the bards,  
For the sweet flowing song,  
And wizards' posing lore,  
And wisdom of Druids.  
In the court of the sons of the distributor  
Some are who did appear  
Intent on wily schemes,  
By craft and tricking means,  
In pangs of affliction  
To wrong the innocent,  
Let the fools be silent,  
As erst in Baden's fight—  
With Arthur of liberal ones,  
The head, with long red blades,  
Through feats of testy men,  
And a chief with his foes.  
Woe be to them, the fools,  
When revenge comes on them.  
I Taliesin, chief of bards,  
With a sapient druid's words,  
Will set kind Elphin free,  
From haughty tyrant's bonds.  
To their fell and chilling cry,  
By the act of a surprising steed.  
From the far distant North,  
There soon shall be an end.  
Let neither grace nor health  
Be to Maelgwn Gwynedd,  
For this force and this wrong;  
And be extremes of ills  
And an avenged end  
To Rhun and all his race :  
Short be his coarse of life,  
Be all his lands laid waste ;  
And long exile be assigned  
To Maelgwn Gwynedd !"

After this he took leave of his mistress, and came at last to the court of Maelgwn, who was going to sit in his hall and dine in his royal state, as it was the eastern in those days for kings and. princes to do at eveiy chief feast. And as soon as Taliesin entered the hall, he placed him- self in a quiet comer, near the place where the bards and the minstrels were wont to come to in doing their service and duty to the king, as is the custom at the high festivals when the bounty is proclaimed. And so, when the bards and the heralds came to cry largess and to proclaim the power of the king and his strength, at the moment that they passed by the corner wherein he was crouching, Taliesin pouted out his lips after them, and played "Blerwm, blerwm" with hia finger upon his lips. Neither took they much notice of him as they went by, but proceeded forward till they came before the king, unto whom they made their obeisance with their bodies, as they were wont, without speaking a single word, but pouting out their lips, and making mouths at the king, playing "Blerwm, blerwm," upon their lips with their fingers, as they had seen the boy do elsewhere. This sight caused the king to wonder and to deem within himself that they were drunk with many liquors. Wherefore he commanded one of his lords, who served at the board, to go to them and desire them to collect their wits, and to consider where they stood, and what it was fitting for them to do. And this lord did so gladly. But they ceased not from their folly any more than before. Whereupon he sent to them a second time, and a third, desiring them to go forth from the hall. At the last the king ordered one of his squires to give a blow to the chief of them named Heinin Vardd; and the squire took a broom, and struck him on the head, so that he fell back in his seat. Then he arose and went on his knees, and besought leave of the king's grace to show that this their fault was not through want of knowledge, neither through drunkenness, but by the influence of some spirit that was in the hall. And after this Heinin spoke on this wise. "Oh honourable king, be it known to your grace, that not from the strength of drink, or of too much liquor, are we dumb, without power of speech like drunken men, but through the influence of a spirit that sits in the corner yonder in the form of a child." Forthwith the king commanded the squire to fetch him ; and he went to the nook where Taliesin sat, and brought him before the king, who asked him what he was, and whence he came. And he answered the king in verse.

"Primary chief bard am I to Elphin,  
And my original country is the region of the summer stars ;  
Idno and Heinin caUed me Merddin,  
At length every king will call me Taliesin.

I was with my Lord in the highest sphere,  
On the fall of Lucifer into the depth of hell :  
I have borne a banner before Alexander ;  
I know the names of the stars from north to south;  
I have been on the galaxy at the throne of the Distributor ;  
I was in Canaan when Absalom was slain ;  
I conveyed the divine Spirit to the level of the vale of Hebron ;  
I was in the court of Don before the birth of Gwdion.  
I was instructor to Eli and Enoc ;  
I have been winged by the genius of the splendid crosier ;  
I have been loquacious prior to being gifted with speech ;  
I was at the place of the crucifixion of the merciful Son of God;  
I have been three periods in the prison of Arianrod ;  
I have been the chief director of the work of the tower of Nimrod;  
I am a wonder whose origin is not known.

I have been in Asia with Noah in the ark,  
I have seen the destructicm of Sodom and Gomorra ;  
I have been in India when Roma was built,  
I am now come here to the remnant of Troia.

I have been with mj Lord in the manger of the ass;  
I strengthened Moss through the water of Jordan ;  
I have been in the firmament with Mary Magdalene ;  
I have obtained the muse from the cauldron of Ceridwen ;  
I have been bard of the harp to Lleon of Lochlin.  
I have been on the White Hill, in the court of Cynvelyn,  
For a day and a year in stocks and fetters,  
I have suffered hanger for the Son of the Virgin.  
I have been fostered in the land of the Deity,  
I have been teacher to all intelligences,  
I am able to instruct the whole universe.  
I shall be until the day of doom on the face of the earth ;  
And it is not known whether my body is flesh or fish.

Then I was for nine months  
In the womb of the hag Caridwen ;  
I was originally little Gwion,  
And at length I am Taliesin."

And when the king and his nobles had heard the song, they wondered much, for they had never heard the like from a boy so young as he. And when the king knew that he was the bard of Elphin, he bade Heinin, his first and wisest bard, to answer Taliesin and to strive with him. But when he came, he could do no other, but play "blerwm" on his lips; and when he sent for the others of the four and twenty bards, they all did likewise, and could do no other. And Maelgwn asked the boy Taliesin what was his errand, and he answered him in song.

And while he was thus singing his verse near the door, there arose a mighty storm of wind, so that the king and all his nobles thought that the castle would fall upon their heads. And the king caused them to fetch Elphin in haste from his dungeon, and placed him before Taliesin. And it is said, that immediately he sang a verse, so that the chains opened from about his feet

Taliesin having set his master free from prison, and having protected the innocence of his wife, and silenced the Bards so that not one of them dared to say a word, now brought Elphin's wife before them, and shewed that she bad not one finger wanting. Right glad was Elphin, right glad was Taliesin.

Then he bade Elphin wager the king, that he had a horse both better and swifter than the king's horses. And this Elphin did, and the day, and the time, and the place were fixed, and the place was that which at this day is called Morva Rhiannedd ; and thither the king went with all his people, and four and twenty of the swiftest horses he posseaaed. And after a long process the course was marked, and the horses were placed for running. Then came Taliesin with four and twenty twigs of holly, which he had burnt black, and he caused the youth who was to ride his master's horse to place them in his belt, and he gave him orders to let all the king's horses get before him, and as he should overtake one horse after the other, to take one of the twigs and strike the horse with it over the crupper, and then let that twig fall; and after that to take another twig; and do in like manner to every one of the horses; as he should overtake them, enjoining the horseman strictly to watch when his own horse should stumble, and to throw down his cap on the spot. All these things did the youth fulfil, giving a blow to every one of the king's horses, and throwing down his cap on the spot where his horse stumbled. And to this spot Taliesin brought his master after his horse had won the race. And he caused Elphin to put workmen to dig a hole there; and when they had dug the ground deep enough, they found a large cauldron full of gold. And then said Taliesin, "Elphin, behold a payment and reward unto thee, for having taken me out of the weir, and for having reared me from that time until now." And on this spot stands a pool of water, which is to this time called Pwllbair.

After all this, the king caused Taliesin to be brought before him, and he asked him to recite concerning the creation of man from the beginning; and thereupon he made the poem which is now called "One of the four pillars of song."

He further told the king various prophecies of things that should be in the world, in songs, as follows.


Notes pp390-400

Taliesin, literally, the "Radiant Brow," was a Welsh Bard of the sixth century. His name, regarded hy his countrymen with the reverence due to the " Prince of Song" is known to the Saxon chiefly through the hrief hat spirited inrocation of Gray.

The text records the fiction of which Taliesin is the hero. Of his real history, little is known excepting what may he gleaned from his works, and from the following notices given in the volume of Iolo MSS. recently published by the Welsh MSS. Society. The first of these latter is taken from Anthony Powel of Llwydarth's MS.

"Taliesin, chief of the Bards, the son of Saint Henwg of Caerlleon upon Usk, was invited to the court of Urien Rheged, at Aberllychwr. He, with Elffin, the son of Urien, being once fishing at sea in a skin coracle, an Irish pirate ship seized him and his coracle, and bore him away towards Ireland ; but while the pirates were at the height of their drunken mirth, Taliesin pushed his coracle to the sea, and got into it himself, with a shield in his hand which he found in the ship, and with which he rowed the coracle until it verged the land ; but, the waves breaking then in wild foam, he lost his hold on the shield, so that he had no alternative but to be driven at the mercy of the sea, in which state he continued for a short time, when the coracle stuck to the point of a pole in the weir of Gwyddno, Lord of Ceredigion, in Aberdyri ; and in that position he was found, at the ebb, by Gwyddno's fishermen, by whom he was interrogated ; and when it was ascertained that he was a bard, and the tutor of Elffin, the son of Urien Rheged, the son of Cynvarch : — " I, too, have a son named Elffin," said Gwyddno, " be thou a bard and teacher to him, also, and I will give thee lands in free tenure." The terms were accepted ; and, for several successive years, he spent his time between the courts of Urien Rheged and Gwyddno, called Gwyddno Garanhir, Lord of the Lowland Centred : but after the territory of Gwyddno had become overwhelmed by the see, Taliesin was invited by the Emperor Arthur, to his court at Caerlleon upon Usk, where he became highly celebrated for poetic genius and useful, meritorious sciences. After Arthur's death, he retired to the estate given to him by Gwyddno, taking Elffin, the son of that prince, under his protection. — It was from this account that Thomas, the son of Einion Offeiriad, descended from Gruffydd Gwyr, formed his romance of Taliesin, the son of Cariadwen, — Elffin, the son of Goddnou, — Rhun the son of Maelgwn Gwynedd, — and the operations of the Cauldron of Ceridwen."

Next follows the Pedigee of Taliesin, Chief of the bards, from Thomas Hopkin of Coycburch's MS.—

"Taliesin, Chief of the Bards of the West, the son of Saint Henwg, of Caerlleon upon Usk, the son of Fflwch, the son of Cynin, the son of Cynvarch, the son of Saint Clydawc, of Ewyas, the son of Gwynnar, the son of Caid, the son of Cadren, the son of Cynan, the son of Cyllin, the son of Caradog, the son of Bran, the son of Llyr Llediaith, King Paramount of all the Kings of Britain, and King, in lineal descent, of the country between the rivers Wye and Towy. Taliesin became Chief Bard of the West, from having been appointed to preside over the chair of the Round Table, at Caerlleon upon Usk."

A manuscript once in the Havod Uchtryd collection gives the fol- lowing particulars. —

"Taliesin, Chief of the Bards of the West, the son of Henwg the Bard, of the college of Saint Cadocus, the son of Fflwch Lawdrwm, of Caerlleon upon Usk, in Glamorgan, the son of Cynvar, the son of Saint Clydog, the son of Gwynnar, the son of Cadrain, the son of Cynan, the son of Caradog, the son of Bran the Blessed, the son of Llyr Llediaith.

Taliesin, Chief of the Bards, erected the church of Llanhenwg at Caerlleon upon Usk, which he dedicated to the memoty of his father, called Saint Henwg, who went to Rome on a mission to Constantino the Blessed, requesting that he would send Saints Germanus and Lupus to Britain, to strengthen the faith, and renew bapUsm there.

Taliesin, the son of Henwg, was taken by the wild Irish, who unjvustly occupied Gower ; but while on board ship on his way to Ireland, he saw a skin coracle, quite empty, on the surface of the sea, and it came closely to the side of the ship ; wherenpon Taliesin, taking a skin-covered spar in his hand, leaped into it, and rowed towards land, until he stuck on a pole in the weir of Gwyddno Garanhir ; when a young chieftain, named Elphn seeing him so entangled, delivered him from his peril. This Elphin was taken for the son of Gwyddno ; although in reality, he was the son of Elivri his daughter, but by whom, was then quite unknown : it was howerer, afterwards diseorered that Urien Rheged, King of Gower and Aberllychwr, was his father, who introduced him to the court of Arthur, at Caerlleon upon Usk; where his feats, learning, and endowments, were found to be so superior, that he was created a golden-tongued Knight of the Round Table.— After the death of Arthur, Taliesin became Chief Bard to Urien Rheged, at Aberllychwr in Rheged."

NOTES TO TALIESIN.
Taliesin.— Page 471.

Taliesin, literally, the " Radiant Brow," was a Welsh Bard of the sixth century. His name, regarded by his countrymen with the reverence due to the "Prince of Song," is known to the Saxon chiefly through the brief but spirited invocation of Gray.

The text records the fiction of which Taliesin is the hero. Of his real history little is known, excepting what may be gleaned from his works, and from the following notices given in the volume of Iolo MSS. recently published by the Welsh MSS. Society. The first of these latter is taken from Anthony Powel of Llwydarth's MS.

" Taliesin, Chief of the Bards, the son of Saint Henwg of Caerlleon upon Usk, was invited to the court of Urien Rheged, at Aberllychwr. He, with Elffin, the son of Urien, being once fishing at sea in a skin coracle, an Irish pirate ship seized him and his coracle, and bore him away towards Ireland ; but while the pirates were at the height of

The terms were accepted, and for several successive years he spent his time between the courts of Urien Rhege'd and Gwyddno, called Gwyddno Garanhir, Lord of the Lowland Cantred ; but after the territory of Gwyddno had become overwhelmed by the sea, Taliesin was invited by the Emperor Arthur to t his court at Caerlleon upon Usk, where he became highly celebrated for poetic genius and useful, meritorious Sciences. After Arthur's death he retired to the estate given to him 1 by GwyddnO, taking Elffin, the son of that prince, under his pro¬ tection. It was from this account that Thomas, the son of Einion Offeiriad, descended from Gruffydd Gwyr, formed his romance of Taliesin, the son of Cariadwen—Elffin, the son of Goddnou—Rhun, the son of Maelgwn Gwynedd, and the operations of the Cauldron of Ceridwen."

Next follows the Pedigree of Taliesin, Chief of the Bards, from Thomas Hopkin of Coychurch's MS.:—

Caridwen.— Page, 471...

Caridwen is generally considered to be the Goddess of Nature of Welsh mythology. The principal circumstances of her fabulous history are those detailed in the Mabinogi of Taliesin. Upon them are founded most of the allusions to her contained in the poems of the bards, with whom the cauldron of Caridwen, of Inspiration, or the Awen, is a subject of frequent reference. As regards her singular family we have but little information and few details. Several notices, however, occur in Welsh writings of her fair daughter Creirwy. Of these it may be sufficient to instance the Triad —which celebrates her with Arianrod and Gwenn, verch Cywryd ab Crydon, as one of the three beauteous ladies of the island. `[Triad 107.]` One of the two Triads extant on the subject of Morvran has been already cited. (See p. 273.) It alludes to the extreme ugliness assigned him in the text, to which, nevertheless, he was indebted for the preservation of his life in the battle of Catalan ; the other ranks him with Gilbert mab Oadgyffro and Gwgan Gleddyvrudd, as one of the three stayers of slaughter `[Triad xxix.]` . No further particulars of him are preserved.

Gwyddno Garanhir. —Page 472.
Gwyddno Garanhir was Sovereign of Cantref y Gwaelod, a territory bordering on the sea, and protected from its ravages by a high embankment. One evening there was revelry at the Coart, and Seithenin, `[Seithinyn the Drunkard's mischance in letting the sea overflow the
Cantrev y Gwaelod, is related .in Triad xli.]` the son of Seithyn Saidi, King of Dyved, upon whom it devolved to look after the embankment, `[Traces of three anoient stone embankments are said to be still visible in the district where this inundation took place. They are called Sam Oynvelyn, Sara y Bwch, and Sara Padrig. " The latter is particularly conspicuous, being left dry at low water to the extent of about nine miles, and the sailors of the neighbouring ports describe its whole length to be twenty-one miles, beginning near Harlech, and running in a south-west direction.” (Cambro-Briton, 1.362.) The Hanes Cymru contains some interesting remarks on this subject.]` and see that all was safe, became inebriated and neglected his charge. The consequence was that the sea broke in through the bank in the course of the night. Gwyddno and his Court escaped with difficulty from the impending ruin, and the Cantrev y Gwaelod was submerged and irretrievably lost. By this calamity sixteen fortified cities, the lai-gest and finest that were in Wales, excepting only Caerlleon upon Usk, were entirely destroyed, and Cardigan Bay occupies the spot where the fertile plains of the Cantrev had been the habitation and support of a flourishing population. Such as escaped the inundation fled to Ardudwy, and the country of Arvon, and the mountains of Eryri (Snowdon), and other places not previously inhabited. By none was this misfortune more severely felt than by Gwyddno Garanhir, to whom the reverse of circumstances it occasioned was so great that, from being an opulent monarch, he was all at once reduced to

Morvran the Son of Tegid .—Page 224.
This circumstance of the three warriors escaping from the battle of Cumlau is related in the Triads, in words very nearly corresponding with those iu the text. The two accounts differ only as regards the name of the third man, whom the Triad-, instead of Kynwyl Sant, represent to have been GlSwlwyd Gavaelvawr, to whom, as King Arthur's Porter, we have already been introduced.—Triad 83.- From the Hanes Taliesin, we learn that Morvran was the son of Tegid Yoel and Ceridwen.

Sarn Badrwj'g (vulgarly Sarn Badric) is a stone wall which rnns out into the sea from Mochras, a point of land a few miles south of Harlech, in a south-west direction, for nearly twenty miles. It is a wonderful work, being throughout, about twenty-four feet thick. Sarn y Bwch runs from a point north-west of Harlech, and is sup- posed to meet the end of this. The space between these, formed, some centuries ago, a habitable hundred to Merionethshire, called Cantref Gwaelod. The Welsh have yet traditions respecting several of the towns, as Cacr Gwydddo, Caer Cenedor, &c. These walls were built to keep the sea out. About the year 500, when Gwyddno Goronhir (Gwyddno with the high crown) was lord of this hundred, one of the men who had the care of the dhms got drank, and left open a flood- gate. The sea broke through with such force as also to tear down part of the wall, and overflow the whole hundred, which, since that time has always been completely flooded. Thus is Cardigan bay, a principal part of which Cantref Gwaelod formerly occupied, for many miles so full of shoals as to render it extremely dangerous for a vessel of any burthen to venture at all near the Merionethshire coast.

... The third was drunken Seithinyn , the son of Seithyn Saidi , king of Dimetia ; who when in a state of intoxication suffered the sea ( by neglecting to attend the sluices ) to overflow the lowland hundred ( or Cantrei'r gwaelod ) where lands and habitations the most beautiful in all Wales , excepting only Caerllion on Usk , to the number of sixteen cities and towns , were in a short period inundated and ruined . The lowland hundred was the property of Gwyddno , surnamed longshanks , king of Caeredigiawn ( or Cardiganshire . ) This event happened in the reign of Emrys Wledig ( or the illustrious ) . The inhabitants who escaped from that inundation landed in Ardudwy , a part of Caernarvonshire , and ascended the mountains of Snowden , which had never been i habited before that period .
