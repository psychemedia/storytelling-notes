THE MABINOGI OF TALIESIN.

INTRODUCTORY REMARKS.

In selecting the romance here submitted to your readers, as a farther specimen of the ancient tales I have it in contemplation to publish, I have been principally swayed by these two considerations ; the bringing forward a tale whose composer or adapter, and the period at which he flourished, are known,—and the elucidation of the era of some poetical pieces, which have been generally ascribed to Taliesin.

In these respects I deem this performance of interest ; for no other work of this description, that has come under my observation, can be appropriated with certainty to any determinate period ; nor can a more satisfactory clue to the reasons for composing poems in the names of celebrated characters be required.

The compiler, Hopkin Thomas Phillip, wrote this piece, about the year 1370. He lived in Morganweg, or Glamorgan; and his language is an interesting specimen of the Gwentian dialect, and an elegant model for prose composition. I, however, have reason to suspect that some of the poetical parts of this romance have been taken by him from some previous work of the same description, as the style and language would induce us to ascribe them to the twelfth and thirteenth centuries ; and some of them are attributed to Jonas Mynyw, or Jonas of Menevia, who appears to have lived at a period anterior to our author.

That this species of composition prevailed in Wales for many centuries we are well assured ; and we have an appropriate parallel to our present inquiry, in the declared intention of Geofry of Monmouth to embody the vaticinations of Merddin (Merlin) in a romance, which intention he afterwards relinquished, and published them in a poetical form, without the connecting narrative which he previously con- templated.

It is not unlikely some romance based upon the history of Taliesin, similar to the one under consideration, may have been known at the period of the first Norman lords of Glamorgen, and the language, by the lapse of time, may have become too obsolete for the facile comprehension of all classes ; and Hopkin Thomas Phillip may have modernized the narrative prose, and given the best version of the poetry he could procure. This surmise is strengthened by the very numerous copies we possess of these poetical pieces, some of which greatly differ from each other, apparently taken down from oral delivery of the tale by various reciters, and which could not well occur if the composition was the entire work of a person so late as the conclusion of the fourteenth century. (The Gaelic sgeulachds, or scholia, which accompany the old Gaelic poems attributed to Ossian, and described as containing the achievements of Fingal, &c., appear to have been similar in composition to tales of this description. )

Of the narrative part but one version exists, and therefore it requires no observation. Of the poetical portion, I have selected those readings which appeared to be the best, and admitted of the most consistent translation. Many of these poetical compositions have long been known and admired as most happy efforts in the Welsh language; and the author, though unknown, as it is not consistent with probability to attribute them to any person anterior to the twelfth century, nor so late as the close of the fourteenth, must rank high among those gifted men who have been the most successful votaries of the British *awen*, (poetical inspiration.) These pieces, beautiful as they are, we must arrange in their proper rank, reject them as historical documents, and discard them as the genuine compositions of Taliesin, the
bard of Urien Reged and Rhun.

The editors of the Myvyrian Archaiology were bound to give to the world all the pieces, whatever their origin, which were ascribed to the poets whose works were comprised in that collection, leaving it to the critic to elucidate the various styles, and pronounce upon the authenticity of the productions— this department was not within the scope of their undertaking, but it would afford a highly interesting inquiry, judiciously to investigate our ancient remains, as far as possible ascribe them to their proper era, and discriminate between the materials of sober history and splendid fiction.

With these introductory remarks, I enclose for your pages a translation of the Mabinogi, or tale of Taliesin.

IDRISON.

THE MABINOGI TALE OF TALIESIN.

There was a nobleman in former times, of Penllyn, who was called Tegid the Bald, and his patrimony was in the middle of the lake of Tegid `[This lake is near the town of Bala. in Meirion.]`; and his married wife was called Keridwen `[The fair procreator: in the bardic mythology, an epithet for the first woman; and she was feigned to be the mother of Morvran ab Tegid, who escaped from the battle of Camlan, owing to his hideous form ; and Sandde, of angel aspect, escaped by a way being made from his being taken for an angel; and Glewlwyd of the mighty grasp, escaped, as no foe dared to stand in his way. These three were the representatives of ugliness, beauty, and strength]`, and of that wife a son was born named Morvran ab Tegid, and a daughter named Creirvyw, who was the fairest damsel in the world, and a brother of theirs was the ugliest person among men, and this was Avagddu.

Then Keridwen, the mother of Avagddu, considered it as not likely that he should have reception among the nobility, from his being so ugly, unless he were endowed with some pre-eminent gifts or sciences; for this was at the commencement of the era of Arthur and the round table

And thereupon, by having recourse to books of chemistry, she prepared to concoct a cauldron of genius and sciences for her son, so that his reception might be more honourable, on account of his sciences, and his knowledge in respect to the future state of the world.

So she began to boil the cauldron, the which, after it should be made to boil, could not be suffered to leave off boiling until the end of a year and a day, so that three blessed drops should be obtained through the grace of the spirit. And little Gwion, the son of a yeoman of Llanvair Caereinion, in Powys, was placed by her to attend the cauldron, and a blind man named Morda to keep up the fire under it, with a command not to suffer the boil to break until a year and a day should elapse ; and she also, through the books of the astronomers, and by the hours of the planets, being daily collecting of such various herbs as had some peculiar virtue.

And on a certain day, as Keridwen was collecting herbs, and the end of the year drawing near, three drops of the pure water flew out of the cauldron, and lighted upon the finger of little Gwion: and, from its being so hot, at the instant he put those thoes precious drops into his mouth, and no sooner had he done so, than he obtained a knowledge of every thing that might occur in future : and he was thus forewarned that his principal care must be to avoid the wiles of Keridwen, for her inventive powers were great, and out of extreme fear he fled towards his own country ; and the cauldron was broken in two, because the whole of the steel was of a deleterious nature, except those three precious drops, and thus the steeds of Gwyddno Longshank were poisoned by drinking of the water from the brook into which the cauldron ran, and  therefore the brook thenceforth was called the poison of Gwyddno's horses. And thereupon Keridwen was observed returning home, and seeing her labour for a twelvemonth lost, she snatched up a billet, and struck the blind Morda upon his head, so that one of his eyes fell down his cheek ; whereupon he then said, "badly hast thou disfigured me, and I being innocent! thou hast suffered no loss on my account." "Thou hast spoken the truth," said Keridwen, " it was little Gwion that robbed me;" and so she followed him upon a run. And thereupon he observed her, and so he changed himself into the form of a hare, and ran off; then she also appeared as a hound bitch, doubled him, and turned him towards a river; and then he appeared as a fish, and she also in the form of an otter bitch, and pursued him under the water; so that he was compelled to appear as a bird in the air, and she as a hawk to pursue him, and so gave him no quiet in the air; and as she was overtaking him, and he having the fear of death upon him, he observed a heap of winnowed wheat on a barn floor, and so alighted into the wheat, and appeared in the form of one of the grains, and thereupon she also appeared as a black crested hen, and into the wheat she went, which, scratching with her feet, she recognized him, and swallowed him: and, as said in the narrative, she was nine months pregnant of him; and, after her delivery, she could not in her heart kill him, so beautiful he seemed, but she wrapped him in a leathern bag, and cast him to the will of man into the sea, on the 29th of April.

And at that time Gwyddno had a wear on the sand between Dyvi and Aberystwyth, near to his own castle; and in that wear there was obtained to the value of a hundred pounds at every May eve. At that time, Gwyddno had one son, who was called Elphin, being one of the most untoward of youths, and suffering the createst privation, which was a cause of grief to his father, fearing that he was born in an evil hour: and through the advice of his counsellors, his father gave him the drought of the wear for that year, to see if ever any luck befel him, and to make a beginning of employment for him.

The following morning, as Elphin was examining the wear, and finding there was nothing in it, was going away, he discovered a leathern bag suspended from a pole of the wear; then one of the wear men said to Elphin, "Thou hast never been unfortunate before this night, for thou hast broken the virtues of the wear, wherein there used to be obtained the value of a hundred pounds on every May eve."

" Now," said Elphin, " what if there might be an equivalent to the hundred pounds in this ?"

The skin was untied, and the opener of it saw the forehead of a boy, and he exclaimed, "See, here is a fair front !"

"Fair Front [i.e. Taliesin] let his name be," said Elphin, raising him up between his hands, bewailing his misfortune, and pensively placed him in a pannier on one of his horses, and at the instant he made the horse canter that only trotted before, thus conducting him so softly as if he were sitting in the easiest chair that possibly could be, and thus carrying the boy, composed the verses called "The Consolation of Elphin," with an eulogy, anda prophecy of honourable advancement to him; and the Consolation was the first song made by Taliesin, and which was to console Elphin on the way home as he sorrowed at the loss of the drought of the wear ; and above all he was concerned that the fault and misfortune were attributed to him. The Consolation was to this effect :

Fair Elphin cease to lament!  
Let no one be dissatisfied with his own,  
To despair will bring no advantage.  
No man sees what supports him;  
The prayer of Cynllo will not be in vain;  
God will not violate his promise.  
Never in Gwyddno's wear  
Was there such good luck as this night.

Fair Elphin, dry thy cheeks!  
Although thou thinkest thou hast no gain,  
Too much grief will bring thee no good:  
Nor doubt the miracles of the Almighty:  
Although I am but little, I am highly gifted.  
From seas, and from mountains,
And from the depths of rivers,  
God brings wealth to the fortunate man.

Elphin of lively qualities,
Thy resolution is unmanly ;  
Thou must not be over sorrowful:  
Better to trust in God than to forbode ill.  
Weak and small as I am,  
On the foaming beach of the ocean,  
In the day of trouble, I shall be  
Of more service to thee than 300 salmon.

Elphin of notable qualities,  
Be not displeased at thy misfortune;  
Although reclined thus weak in my bag,  
There lies a virtue in my tongue.  
While I continue thy protector  
Thou hast not much to fear:  
Remembering the names of the Trinity,  
None shall be able to harm thee.

The foregoing, with various other verses were sung by Taliesin for the comfort of Elphin, during his journey, who, on arriving at home, presented the contents of the pannier to his wife, who nursed the child dearly and tenderly.

From that time forward the wealth of Elphin increased more and more day after day, and he obtained the favour and love of the king; who, some short time afterwards, kept open court in Christmas time at the castle of Dyganwy, surrounded by his lords, both spiritual and temporal, with a great number of knights and esquires. `[This was Maelewn, who reigned A.D. 517 to A.D. 654.]`

In this assembly the following conversation took place : "Is there in the whole world a king so powerful as Maelgwn, and so endowed by heaven with spiritual gifts? In the first lace, comliness of person, and urbanity, and strength, besides all the energies of the soul ; and along with these gifts, they say, the Father has bestowed upon him one eminent gift that is superior to the others altogether, which is, happiness in having a queen whose form and demeanour, and wisdom, and chastity, are qualities possessed by her in a higher degree than by all the noble ladies in the kingdom."

Besides this subject, they threw out questions amongst themselves, as to who was the bravest of his men; who had the finest and swiftest horses and greyhounds; who had better informed and wiser bards than Maelgwn. These were at the time in great esteem amongst the dignitaries of the kingdom; and at that time none were advanced to the office at present called a herald, except such as were learned men; and not only were they employed in the service of kings and princes, but were required to be well versed in genealogies, armorial bearings, and the deeds of kings and princes, as well in respect to foreign kingdoms as to the elders of these kingdoms; and particularly as to the history of the principal nobility. It was necessary also, for all of them to be most ready with their answers in the several languages of Latin, French, Welsh, and English; and, in addition to this, to be great historians, and to be of good memory, and accomplished in poetry, so as readily to compose metrical verses in each of those languages.

And of these there were at the court of Maelgwn, during that festival, as many as four and twenty; and chief over them was one who was called Heinin the Bard.

Thus, after all had extolled the king, and enumerated his virtues, it happened that Elphin should express himself in this manner :

"Truly, no one is able to compete with a king but a king ; however, let that be granted, and indeed if he were not a king, I might say that I have a wife equal in respect to personal chastity to any lady that can be found in the kingdom. And besides, I have one bard who is better informed than all the bards of the king."

In a little time the king was informed of all the boasting of Elphin by some of his companions, for which the king commanded him to be confined in a strong prison, until he should be enabled to obtain true information in respect to the chastity of his wife, and also in respect to the talents of his bard.

Then, after Elphin had been placed in a tower of the castle, with heavy fetters on his legs, which fetters were said to be of silver, on account of his being of royal blood, the account shows that the king employed Rhun, his son, to prove the chastity of the wife of Elphin, which Rhun was one of the most lascivious characters that ever lived; for neither wife nor maiden escaped free from imputation, with whom he obtained but a short space for discourse.

And as Rhun was coming in great haste towards the mansion of Elphin, with full intention to debauch his wife, Taliesin told his mistress what he had long observed, from the conduct of the king in confining his master, and the way that Rhun had come with the design of assailing her chastity; and therefore he advised his mistress to dress one of the maids of the kitchen in her clothes. This the lady gladly complied with unsparingly, by ornamenting her hands with a profusion of the choicest rings in the possession of herself and her husband. In this manner Taliesin directed his mistress to place the maid to sit at the table in her stead to supper, and Taliesin contrived to make her appear like her mistress, and the mistress to be like the maid.

Thus as they were seated in the most sumptuous style at supper, as has been described, Rhun suddenly appeared at the hall of Elphin, and was joyfully ushered in, for all the attendants knew him well; and they quickly introduced him into the room to their mistress, in whose resemblance the maid got up from the supper, and politely welcomed him; and afterwards she again sat to supper, Rhun being seated along with her ; and presently he began to joke with obscene expressions with the maid, who studied to preserve the semblance of her mistress: and indeed, the narrative shows that the maid became so inebriated as to begin to fall asleep ; and it is also stated that Rhun infused some powders in her drink, which caused her to sleep so soundly, as not at all to feel his cutting her little finger off her hand, on which was a ring with the signet of Elphin, which he had sent as a token of his wife a little while before. In this manner he did whatever he thought proper to the girl; and then he took the finger with the ring round it, as a token for the king of his having succeeded, by showing the manner how he had cut off her fin- ger on leaving her, without her being awaked out of her sleep.

From these reports the king was greatly delighted; and in consequence he sent for his council, to whom he explained the whole of the matter, from beginning to end: also commanding Elphin to be brought from the prison, that he might be reprimanded for his boasting ; and thereupon he addressed Elpbin in this manner:

"Elphin, be it known to thee, and doubt thou not, that it is but folly for any man in the world to believe a woman in respect to her personal chastity, farther than he may be able to observe her; and that thou mayest ascertain how thy wife broke her marriage vow the very night last past, behold, here is her finger as a proof for thee, with thy signet ring round it, which was cut from her hand in her sleep, by the person that slept with her ; so that, as thou mayest not have to boast by saying she had not transgressed in respect to her chastity."

To these words E!phin replied in the following manner: "By thy permission, honourable king, permit me to say, that I am by no means able to deny my ring for there are many people he can identify it; but, in truth, I solemnly assert that the finger round which it is was never joined to the hand of my wife ; for, in certain truth, it has upon it three particular things, not any one of which was ever upon either of the fingers of the hands of my wife, and the first of the three is conclusive, by the leave of your grace, wheresoever my wife may at present be, whether sitting, or standing, or lying down, this ring will not stick even upon her thumb; and you may plainly observe, it must be difficult to force this ring over the joint of the smallest finger of the hand from which this finger was taken; and the second thing is, that my wife has not been on any Saturday, since I have known her, without having her nails pared before going to bed; and, indeed, you can plainly see that the nail of this finger has not been cut for a month; and the third thing is this, that the hand from which this finger has been cut has kneeded some dough of rye within the three days prior to this finger being cut off it; and I will confirm it as true to your goodness, that my wife has not kneeded rye dough since she has been a wife to me."

Then the king became extremely angry with Elphin for standing out so stoutly against him on behalf of the chastity of his wife; and on that account the king commanded him the second time to prison, saying that he should not be liberated from thence, until he proved his boasting to be true, as well in respect to the talent of his bard as to the purity of his wife: these were during the time in the palace of Elphin, making merry; and, in the meanwhile, Taliesin informed his mistress how Elphin was in prison on their account; but he desired her to appear cheerful, and explained to her the manner he would go to the court of Maelgwn to liberate his master. Thereupon she inquired by what means he would free his master; and then he replied in this manner:

" A journey will I perform,  
And to the gate [ will come ;  
The hall I will enter,  
And my song I will sing  
My speech I will pronounce  
To silence royal bards.  
In presence of their chief,  
I will greet to deride,  
Upon them I will break,  
And Elphin I will free.  
Should contention arise,  
In presence of the prince,  
With summons to the bards  
For the sweet-flowing song,  
And wizards' posing lore  
And wisdom of Druids.

In the court of the sons of the distributer  
Some are who did appear  
Intent on wily schemes,  
By craft and tricking means,  
In pangs of affliction  
To wrong the innocent.  
Let the fools be silent,  
As erst in Badon's fight,—  
With Arthur of liberal ones  
The head, with long red blades ;  
Through feats of testy men,  
And a chief with his foes.  
Woe be to them, the fools,  
When revenge comes on them.

I, Taliesin, chief of bards,  
With sapient druids' words,  
Will set kind Elphin free  
From haughty tyrant's bonds.  
To their fell and chilling cry,  
By the act of a surprising steed,  
From the far distant North,  
There soon shall be an end,  
Let neither grace nor health  
Be to Maelgwn Gwynedd,  
For this force and this wrong ;  
And be extremes of ills  
And an avenged end  
To Rhun and all his race:  
Short be his course of life,  
Be all his lands laid waste;  
And long exile be assigned  
To Maelgwn Gwynedd !"

Having spoken thus, Taliesin took leave of his mistress; and at length he arrived at the court of Maelgwn, who, in royal state, was about entering the hall to dinner, in the manner usual with kings and princes, on every high festival in that age. And just as Taliesin had come into the hall, he observed there was room for him in an unfrequented place near where the bards and minstrels were wont to repair to perform their service and devotion to the king, as is still customary in proclaiming largess upon high festivals.

So the time was now arrived for the bards or the heralds to proclaim the largess and liberality of the king; and these came towards the place where Taliesin was squatting in a corner, who stretched out his lip after them, and on it he played "blab blab" with his finger ; they took not much notice of him in passing, but walked on till they came before the king, to whom they made their obeysance with their bodies, as it was proper for them to do, without uttering a single word, but extending out their lips and mouthing at the king, playing "blab blab" with their fingers and lips, as they had seen the boy doing before, which sight filled the king with wonder and amazement, supposing them to be drunk, owing to a profusion of liquors ; therefore he desired one of the lords that ministered at his table to go to them, to request that they would call to mind where they were standing, and how they ought to conduct themselves. This he did with pleasure; but they were not prevailed upon to desist from their folly. On that account, he sent the second and the third time, and ordered them to leave the hall. At length the king desired one of the 'squires to give a blow to the chief of them, who was called Heinin the Bard; then the 'squire took a broom and struck him on his head so that he fell back on his breech, whence he got up on his knees, and then he besought the king's grace for permission to show him that such inadvertence did not arise from neglect, nor from want of thought, nor from ebriety, but from the power of some spirit that was within the hall; and inaddition to this Heinin spoke as follows :

"Illustrious king, be it known to your grace, it is not from the effect of a profusion of liquors that we are dumb, and seem as drunken men, but through the impulse of a spirit sitting in yonder corner in the form of a child."

From that spot the king commanded a 'squire to fetch him, and who went into the corner where Taliesin was sitting, and thence brought him into the presence of the king, who asked him what he was, and from whence he came. Then Taliesin answered him satirically, as is seen here.—

THE MABINOGI OF TALIESIN.
( Continued from the Cambrian Quarterly for April. )

NOTICES OF THE POWERS OF THE BARD.

In water there is a quality endowed with a blessing ; on God it is most just to meditate aright ; to God it is proper to supplicate with seriousness, since no obstacle can there be to obtain a reward from him.

Three times have I been born, I know by meditation; it were miserable for a person not to come and obtain all the sciences of the world, collected together in my breast, for I know what has been, what in future will occur.

I will supplicate my Lord that I get a refuge in him, a regard I may obtain in his grace; the Son of Mary is my trust, great in him is my delight, for in him is the world continually upholden.

God has been to instruct me and to raise my expectation, the true Creator of heaven, who affords me protection; it is rightly intended that the saints should daily pray, for God, the renovator, will bring them to him.

A CHALLENGE TO THE BARDS OF MAELGON.

Is it not natural to be excited  
by the allurement of praise ;


TO DO


p272

I have been on the White Hill,  
in the court of Cynvelyn,  
in stocks and fetters  
for a day and a year.  
I have been a teacher  
to the whole universe;  
I shall be until the day of doom  
on the face of the earth;  
my body it will not be known  
whether flesh or fish.  
I have been in an easy chair  
above the ecliptic,  
and this revolves  
between three elements ;  
then I was for nine months  
in the womb of the hag Ceridwen ;  
I was originally little Gwion,  
and at length I am Taliesin.  

When this composition was made known to the king and his nobles, they became greatly surprised; for they heard not from the mouth of a boy so little any thing that could be compared to this song. And when his majesty knew that its author was the bard of Elphin, he ordered Heinin, his chief and wisest bard, to bring an answer to Taliesin, and to contend with him. But he, on coming forward, could only play blab blab with his lip; and, when the four and twenty other bards were sent for, they did the same thing, and they could not do otherwise. Thereupon Maelgwn asked Taliesin what might be his errand there; and so the other answered in verse in this manner:

Puny bards, I am trying to secure the prize, if I can ;  
by a gentle prophetic strain  
I am endeavouring to retrieve  
the loss I may have suffered ;  
complete the attempt, I hope,  
since Elphin endures trouble  
in the fortress of Teganwy. `[The ruins of the fort of Teganwy : here are still some remains of it on the northern side of the estuary of the Conwy river.]`
His confinement may not be over much,  
strengthened by my muse I am powerful ;  
mighty on my part is what I seek ;  
for, three hundred songs and more,  
are combined in the spell I sing.  
There ought not to stand where I am  
neither stone and neither ring ;  
that there ought not to be about me  
not any bard who may not know  
that Elphin son of Gwyddno  
is in the land of Artro, `[A small estuary, two miles south of Harleg, in Meirion.]`
secured by thirteen locks,  
for praising his instructor :  
and then I Taliesin,  
chief of the bards of the west,  
shall loosen Elphin  
out of a golden fetter.

As Taliesin was thus reciting his composition at the gate, there arose such a storm of wind, that the king and all his nobles thought the castle would fall on their heads; and thereupon the king ordered Elphin to be hastily brought out of prison, and that he might be placed before Taliesin; and immediately it is said that Taliesin sang a song, so that the fetters opened from about the legs of Elphin.

After this he sang a prelude, that is called the master-piece of the bards, as it follows here.

p376

After Taliesin had delivered his lord out of prison, and asserted the chastity of his mistress, and silenced the bards, so that not any one of them dared to utter a single word, he requested of Elphin, that he would make a wager with the king of his possessing a horse swifter than all the horses of his majesty; and this was done by Elphin; and the day, the time, and the place were fixed upon and the spot is to this day called Morva Rhianedd, or sea-marsh of the Maidens. `[This is about three miles from Conwy, on the coast towards Abergeleu.]` So the king and his retinue came there, with twenty-four horses, the swiftest that were in his possession. And on the spot, after a long examination, the course was marked out, and the horses were appointed to run. To that place likewise came Taliesin, bringing with him twenty-four holly rods, made black by charring, and which he ordered the boy who rode the horse of his master to put in his girdle, with giving him directions to let all the horses of the king go before him; and as he could overtake them, each one after the other, he was to take one of the rods, and to give a stroke across the crupper of the horse; and after that he was to take another rod; and thus he did in like manner to all the horses, as he could overtake them, giving a strict command to the rider to watch carefully on what spot the horse might fall, and so put his cap down in that spot. All this was accomplished by the boy, as well in giving a stroke to each one of the king's horses, and of putting his cap down on the spot where the horse fell; and to the place Taliesin brought his master, after his horse had won the ace, and he ordered Elphin to put men at work to dig a pit. In this spot, after they had dug out the earth to a considerable depth, they found a large cauldron, which was full of gold, and at the time Taliesin said,

"Elphin, this is as payment and reward for bringing me out of the wear, and for nursing me from that time to this day.

On the spot where what is spoken of above was performed there is a pool of water, which is called to this day, the pool cauldron.

After that the king ordered Taliesin to be brought before him: and of him he asked for information concerning the beginning of the human race; and thereupon Taliesin composed the prelude, which at this day is called one of the four canons of song, and it begins thus:

Taliesin afterwards recited various predictions, in verse, to the king, as to the future events in the world, which are given in the collection entitled the Primitive Bards.

Out of the book of Iolo Morganwg, being the collection of Hopkin T. Phylip of Glamorgan; made about A.D. 1370.

As the "various predictions" alluded to above contain no particulars of the history of Taliesin himself, his Mabinogi may properly terminate here.

It may be an useful illustration to point out where the principal scenes of this Mabinogi were acted; and this we are enabled to do from their names being still preserved by tradition, in the localities where they occurred.

There is a lake called *Llyn Pair*, or pool of the cauldron, about three miles from Towyn, on the old Macynilaith road through the mountains; the outlet of this lake is among large rocks, and the stream falls into a black pool below, and thence runs into the sea by *Bottalog*; and where it runs through the low ground, it abounds with the water hemlock. In the Mabinogi the name of the river is *Gwenwyn meirç Gwyddno, the poison of Gwyddno's horses*, though its present name is *Avon Llyn y Pair*. About a mile from this lake there is a farm retaining the name of *Gwydd Gwion*, or Gwion wood, from a personage so called in the tale. Three or four miles in the sea, between the outlets of the rivers *Ystwyth* and *Teivi*, are the remains of the fort of Gwyddno, the father of Elphin, and is well known to the people on the neighbouring coast. In the summer of 1770, I sailed over the ruins, in a very calm day, and thus for about three minutes, I had a clear view of them, appearing about twelve feet below the surface of the water; and many of the stones seemed to be large slabs, and lying in confusion on the heap.

TALIESIN.
I N times past there lived in Penllyn a man of gentle lineage, named Tegid Voel, and his dwelling was in the midst of the lake Tegid, aud his wife was called Car id wen. And there was born to him of his wife a son named Morvran ab Tegid., and also a daughter named Creirwy, the fairest maiden in the world was she; aud they had a brother, the most ill-favoured man in the world, Avagddu. Now Caridwen his mother thought that he was not likely to be admitted among men of noble birth, by reason of his ugliness, unless he had some exalted merits or knowledge. For it was in the beginning of Arthur's time and of the Round Table.
So she resolved according to the arts of the books of the Fferyllt, to boil a cauldron of Inspiration and Science for her son, that his reception might be honourable because of his knowledge of the-mysteries of the future state of tbe world.

NOTES TO TALIESIN.
Taliesin.— Page 471.

Taliesin, literally, the " Radiant Brow," was a Welsh Bard of the sixth century. His name, regarded by his countrymen with the reverence due to the "Prince of Song," is known to the Saxon chiefly through the brief but spirited invocation of Gray.

The text records the fiction of which Taliesin is the hero. Of his real history little is known, excepting what may be gleaned from his works, and from the following notices given in the volume of Iolo MSS. recently published by the Welsh MSS. Society. The first of these latter is taken from Anthony Powel of Llwydarth's MS.

" Taliesin, Chief of the Bards, the son of Saint Henwg of Caerlleon upon Usk, was invited to the court of Urien Rheged, at Aberllychwr. He, with Elffin, the son of Urien, being once fishing at sea in a skin coracle, an Irish pirate ship seized him and his coracle, and bore him away towards Ireland ; but while the pirates were at the height of

• their drunken mirth, Taliesin pushed his coracle to the sea, and got into it himself, with a shield in his hand which he found in the ship, and with Which he rowed the coracle until it verged the land; but, the waves breaking then in wild foam, he lost bis hold on the shield, so that he had no alternative but to be driven at the mercy of the sea, in which state he continued for a short time, when the coracle stuck to the point of a pole in the weir of Gwyddno, Lord of Cere¬ digion, in Aberdyvi • and in that position he was found, at the ebb, by Gwyddno's fishermen, by whom he was interrogated; and when it was ascertained that he was a bard, and the tutor of Elffin, the son of Urien Rkeged, the son of Cynvarch :—‘ I, too, have a son named Elffin,' said Gwyddno, ‘ be thou a bard and teacher to him, also, and I will give thee lands in free tenure.' The terms were accepted, and for several successive years he spent his time between the courts of Urien Rhege'd and Gwyddno, called Gwyddno Garanhir, Lord of the Lowland Cantred ; but after the territory of Gwyddno had become overwhelmed by the sea, Taliesin was invited by the Emperor Arthur to t his court at Caerlleon upon Usk, where he became highly celebrated for poetic genius and useful, meritorious Sciences. After Arthur's death he retired to the estate given to him 1 by GwyddnO, taking Elffin, the son of that prince, under his pro¬ tection. It was from this account that Thomas, the son of Einion Offeiriad, descended from Gruffydd Gwyr, formed his romance of Taliesin, the son of Cariadwen—Elffin, the son of Goddnou—Rhun, the son of Maelgwn Gwynedd, and the operations of the Cauldron of Ceridwen."
i-
Next follows the Pedigree of Taliesin, Chief of the Bards, from Thomas Hopkin of Coychurch's MS.:—
“Taliesin, Chief of the Bards of the West, the son of Saint Henwg, of Caerlleon upon Usk, the son of Fflwch, the son of Cynin, the son/ of Cynvarch, the son of Saint Clydawc, of Ewyas, the son of Gwynnar, the son of Caid, the son of Cadren> the son of Cynan, the son of Cyllin, the son of Caradog, the son of Bran, the son of Llyr Llediaith, King Paramount of all the Kings of Britain, and King, in lineal descent, of the country between the rivers Wye and Towy. Taliesin became Chief Bard of the West, from having been appointed to preside over the chair of the Round Table, at Caerlleon upon Usk.” *
A manuscript once; in the Havod Uchtryd collection gives the following particulars:— r * •
“Taliesin, Chief of the Bards of the West, the son of Henwg the Bard, of the College of Saint Cadocus, the son of Fflwch Lawdrwm,

Caridwen.— Page, 471...

Caridwen is generally considered to be the Goddess of Nature of Welsh mythology. The principal circumstances of her fabulous history are those detailed in the Mabinogi of Taliesin. Upon them are founded most of the allusions to her contained in the poems of the bards, with whom the cauldron of Caridwen, of Inspiration, or the Awen, is a subject of frequent reference. As regards her singular family we have but little information and few details. Several notices, however, occur in Welsh writings of her fair daughter Creirwy. Of these it may be sufficient to instance the Triad —which celebrates her with Arianrod and Gwenn, verch Cywryd ab Crydon, as one of the three beauteous ladies of the island. `[Triad 107.]` One of the two Triads extant on the subject of Morvran has been already cited. (See p. 273.) It alludes to the extreme ugliness assigned him in the text, to which, nevertheless, he was indebted for the preservation of his life in the battle of Catalan ; the other ranks him with Gilbert mab Oadgyffro and Gwgan Gleddyvrudd, as one of the three stayers of slaughter `[Triad xxix.]` . No further particulars of him are preserved.

Gwyddno Garanhir. —Page 472.
Gwyddno Garanhir was Sovereign of Cantref y Gwaelod, a territory bordering on the sea, and protected from its ravages by a high embankment. One evening there was revelry at the Coart, and Seithenin, `[Seithinyn the Drunkard's mischance in letting the sea overflow the
Cantrev y Gwaelod, is related .in Triad xli.]` the son of Seithyn Saidi, King of Dyved, upon whom it devolved to look after the embankment, `[Traces of three anoient stone embankments are said to be still visible in the district where this inundation took place. They are called Sam Oynvelyn, Sara y Bwch, and Sara Padrig. " The latter is particularly conspicuous, being left dry at low water to the extent of about nine miles, and the sailors of the neighbouring ports describe its whole length to be twenty-one miles, beginning near Harlech, and running in a south-west direction.” (Cambro-Briton, 1.362.) The Hanes Cymru contains some interesting remarks on this subject.]` and see that all was safe, became inebriated and neglected his charge. The consequence was that the sea broke in through the bank in the course of the night. Gwyddno and his Court escaped with difficulty from the impending ruin, and the Cantrev y Gwaelod was submerged and irretrievably lost. By this calamity sixteen fortified cities, the lai-gest and finest that were in Wales, excepting only Caerlleon upon Usk, were entirely destroyed, and Cardigan Bay occupies the spot where the fertile plains of the Cantrev had been the habitation and support of a flourishing population. Such as escaped the inundation fled to Ardudwy, and the country of Arvon, and the mountains of Eryri (Snowdon), and other places not previously inhabited. By none was this misfortune more severely felt than by Gwyddno Garanhir, to whom the reverse of circumstances it occasioned was so great that, from being an opulent monarch, he was all at once reduced to

Morvran the Son of Tegid .—Page 224.
This circumstance of the three warriors escaping from the battle of Cumlau is related in the Triads, in words very nearly corresponding with those iu the text. The two accounts differ only as regards the name of the third man, whom the Triad-, instead of Kynwyl Sant, represent to have been GlSwlwyd Gavaelvawr, to whom, as King Arthur's Porter, we have already been introduced.—Triad 83.- From the Hanes Taliesin, we learn that Morvran was the son of Tegid Yoel and Ceridwen.

Sarn Badrwj'g (vulgarly Sarn Badric) is a stone wall which rnns out into the sea from Mochras, a point of land a few miles south of Harlech, in a south-west direction, for nearly twenty miles. It is a wonderful work, being throughout, about twenty-four feet thick. Sarn y Bwch runs from a point north-west of Harlech, and is sup- posed to meet the end of this. The space between these, formed, some centuries ago, a habitable hundred to Merionethshire, called Cantref Gwaelod. The Welsh have yet traditions respecting several of the towns, as Cacr Gwydddo, Caer Cenedor, &c. These walls were built to keep the sea out. About the year 500, when Gwyddno Goronhir (Gwyddno with the high crown) was lord of this hundred, one of the men who had the care of the dhms got drank, and left open a flood- gate. The sea broke through with such force as also to tear down part of the wall, and overflow the whole hundred, which, since that time has always been completely flooded. Thus is Cardigan bay, a principal part of which Cantref Gwaelod formerly occupied, for many miles so full of shoals as to render it extremely dangerous for a vessel of any burthen to venture at all near the Merionethshire coast.
