# A Fairy Changeling?

If you ever see someone acting out of character, you might refer to them as "not being themselves". Or if someone is behaving in an extreme way or irrational way, someone might cry out "they must be out of their mind". And so it has always been. And if you lived in a small community where someone was misbehaving, they might need reigning in somehow; if they were misbehaving really badly, folk might feel they even needed punishing. But even then, there needed to be some way to bring the transgressor back into the fold. Some way of redeeming them, or reconciling them back with that community.

Back in old Ireland, it was common to hear that someone was "away with the fairies" if they were acting a bit odd. Strokes were "fairy strokes". And changelings... well, changelings changed everything: a changeling, a fairy changeling, was a fairy swapped for a real person: a baby, an adult, they looked identical, or almost: there might be a sign, one leg shorter than the other, for example; and they didn't like certain things: iron, fire. The changeling explained a lot. If someone was behaving badly? Well: perhaps it wasn't them; a changeling could provide an explanation for why something wasn't "your fault": a sickly or disabled child might be a changeling, for example; and if you mistreated that child for behaving badly: well, perhaps that was to get the fairy out of them. (There was a counter to that: if you mistreated the changeling, then the fairies in the other world would similarly mistreat the person who had been replaced by the changeling.) So: fairies explained a lot.


though in other cases the fairies might harm you if you crossed them or wronged them in some way

And so it was as it is today: people who are different in some way are often treated as somehow alien. And those differences, well, maybe those differences were because the person was a changeling.

Back in old Ireland, as in old England, and in old Wales, and in old Scotland, people kept chickens. Some women, hen-wives, would keep a small flock of chickens and regularly sell eggs around the neighbourhood. Such a trade could bring the woman of the house an even greater income than her labourer husband earned. Bridget Cleary, a dressmaker by trade, a good profession — she even had her own sewing machine — supplemented her income in just such a way, selling eggs around the way; and with her husband, Michael, a cooper, a barrelmaker, they were comfortably off. And didn't she know it, with her ??hat/ribbon??

They were a bit odd, that couple. When they were just married, he had regularly spent time away from home; "working" he said, but folk knew what men away from home for nights on end got up to. And she, well, she was so friendly with the landlord's man (and they'd perhaps spit at the mention of him). There was something not right about that set up, somehow. And how long had they been married, with no children to show for it. She was eighteen when they wed, and what was she now? Twenty-five? Twenty-six, even?

Bridget and Michael lived in a small labourer's cottage, along with Bridget's father, Patrick (Bolland).

So what was it about the case that caused Edward Clodd, President of the Folk-Lore society, to write to the Editor of the London *Daily Chronicle*, suggesting that a more lenient sentence should have been applied?

Black Witchcraft

The spring of 1895 has been disgraced by sporadic cares of witch-mania. White witchcraft has long flourished in those parts of the United Kingdom in which the Celtic race predominates, and in England it is still rampant in what used to be West and North Wales—that is to say, in the present Cornwall and South Wales. We had fondly hoped, however, that black witchcraft was extinct. A distressieg story of horrible cruelty comes from Tipperary and upsets our pnvonceived ideas that questions of black witchcraft were no longer of interest to anyone but to the student of rationalism. A woman, aged 27, the wife of a cooper, has been burnt to death under the supposition that she was a counterfeit or changeling who, being hurt, would disappear, whilst the real woman, held as a hostage by the fairies or good people, would be returned. The episode is one full of interest to the student of folklore, but it not surprise him. The method adopted has been the one in use from time immemorial. Fire in one form or another has always been regarded 113 the great restorer and purifier. It is only in the oldest rituals, however, that the Are is actually employed to compel the restoration of the changeling, so that the present instance appears to be a return to the most ancient and savage form of the custom. Children, es. pecially those who had not been christened, were most liable to be changed, • confounding, no doubt, of cause with effect; for at a time when baptism bad more than • symbolical meaning only those children were left unbaptised who were too ill or too puny to be taken to church, and it was especially such children who were likely to tecoate maraamic and so to appear as change' lisp. The treatment recommended for such children was that the mother should heat the oven very hot, a servant or friend being instructed to ask in a loud voice: "Why do you heat the oven so hot?" The mother would then reply: "1 am going to bc:n my child." The question was asked and answered three times. The changeling was then put upon the peel as If to thrust it into the oven, when it was expected that the fairy would rush in and Rave her offspring, at the same time restorine the original child. In other cases, as in the island of Lewis, the Dessil Are was carried round children night and morning until they were christened, to prevent them being carried off by the fairies. It was easy to detect a changeling apart from its wizened aspect, for it could readily be made to betray its age. The usual method was to boil water over the fire in eggshells, when the changeling would cry out: "Well, I am as old as the itesterwald, but I never saw any - thing boiled in (=shells before." Or, as in the Breton folktumg, where he sees his foster-mother cooking for ten serving -men in one eggshell, and cannot forbear betraying himself by the remark: "I have seen the egg before it became the white hen and the acorn before the oak; I have seen it acorn and oak, and in lirezal wood, but never aught like this." Old as these stories are, however, it would appear that they are the echoes of a still older time when it was the changeling himself who was put into the pipkin symbolised by the eggshell, ani was boiled to death in much the same way as the wretched subject of the recent Irish atrocity.—liedisk

THE CLONMEL "WITCH" BURNING.

THE EDITOR OF THE DAILY CHRONICLE,

Sir,— Your issne of the 6th informs me that the trial of Michael Cleary for mis-called "witch"-burning has ended in a verdict of manslanghter being taken by consent, resulting in a sentence of tweniy years' penal servitude.

The punishment necessary in the case will appear excessive to those familiar with the details of the tragedy, and pending some action which may secure mitigation of the sentence, permit me to briefly outline the grounds which justify such action.

Thie poor, illiterate Cleary shared the belief common to the Celtic peoples that illness, especially of the, to him, perplexing kind that afflicted his wife, is due to the real person having been abducted by fairies, who substitute a changeling resembling the person. Consequently, Cleary had no doubt that the creature whom he was torturing was not Bridget Cleary at all, but a changeling whom the fairies would rescue when they saw her thus treated, and at the same time restore Bridget. "You will soon see my wife come down the chimney," said Cleary to his onlooking neighbours.

So ingrained is the belief, that after the poor creature's death these same neighbours repaired to a so-called fairy fort in the belief that she would appear as a captive in the possession of the "good people," when they would have rushed forward to rescue her.

Your space at this juncture is too valuable to allow room for the remarks which could be made upon the origin and persistence of a belief which has led to so tragic an event.

It will occur to many that for the survival of such superstitions the responsibility should be shared by the Christian organisations which surround these poor peasants of Ballybadlea.— I am, Sir, your obedient servant,

IGNORANCE NO EXCUSE.

€bvening AND STAR Celegraph SHEFFIELD. FRIDAY, JULY 12, 1895. Few tales of barbarity have more disgraced our vannted nineteenth century civilisation than the tragedy known as the Clonmel "witch burning." A wretched woman named Cleary prostrated by illness was treated with almost incred- ible cruelty by her husband and a gang of eonfed- erates; after minor tortures she was half roasted over the fire, and when death mercifully released her from her sufferings her body was buried in a shallow graye with just so much respect as might be acgorded a dog flung imto adyke. The: husband has escaped the punishment which! seemed most in accordance with the crime. His neck hag been spared, but twenty years' penal servitufie is before him as expiation of his at- conduct. It might have been supposed that: he would have congratulated himself, and have been generally deemed lucky to have es- eaped the extreme penalty which usually attaches 4o similar misdeds. There are, however, those who protest against the punishment as excessive, | and the president of the Folk-lore Society, Mr. Edward Clodd, comes forward with a Hrief on the: wretched convict's behalf. Cleary's illiteracy was alone at fault. He had no intention of harming his wife, but he was merely anxious to sufficiently illtreat the changeling sent by the fairies that the substitute would be glad to revert to the old position of affairs. This was the defence set up at the trial. It sayed Cleary from the gallows, and Mr. Clodd thinks it ought to have further excused him the punishment awarded by the judge. That some such idea possessed Cleary may be possible, but its allowance as sufficient excuse for his conduct would have been to palliate an atrocious grime, and to open the door to whole- sale repetitions of similar behaviour. Cleary may have been animated by some gross superstition, | but that he was sufficiently civilised to appreciate the lawlessness of the "charms" he employed is sufficiently clearly indicated by the secrecy in which he enveloped his operations. If the poor of Ballybadlea are so benighted, so wrapped in medizval superstition, Cleary's fate may prove a not-ineffectual warning, while as regards the man himself the sentence, heavy as it is, can hardly be regarded, save by the hyper sentimental, as excessive punishment for one who, to wife or to "changeling," could employ methods of such undiluted barbarity. The appeal on Cleary's behalf may claim the support of the sentimentalists who in every convict's be- haviour can espy a redeeming trait, but it can hardly prove of much practical benefit to the prisoner hirnself. ee eng

There is a good deal in The Witch-burning the plea which Mr. Ed- Case. ward Clodd, the president of the Folklore Society, has just urged. Mr. Clodd thinks that the punishment of the "poor illiterate" Cleary, fur burning his wife as a witch, and sharing "the belief current among the Irish peasants and elsewhere." has been excessive. Cleary was sentenced to 20 years' penal servitude for simply being the victim of a superstitious conviction that "when illness of a vruseuig or mysterious kind overtakes a petson, the real individual has been spirited away by the fairies. and a changeling, resembling the person, substituted." The "Law Journal" also reminds its readers that Sir Willliam Blackstone in 1765—0n1y a short time ago, comparativelywrote "that to denv the possibility—nay the actual existence—of witchcraft and sorcery is flatly to contradict the revered Werd of God in various passages of the (Y.d and New Testament/4." If a highly educated man like Sir William Blackstone could argue thus in the eighteenth century. it does seem hard that a poor Irish peasant with his Bible and "Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live" to guide him. should be so severely dealt with in the nineteenth.

GROSS IGNORANCE AMONGST THE RT SANTRY Mr. Edward Clodd, president of the Folk Lore Society, protests against the sentence of twenty years' penal servitude on Michael Cleary, who was convicted of manslaughter in the Clonmel witch-burning case. Mr. Clodd’s point is that Cleary was 20 grossly ignorant as to believe the The body of his wife to be a changeling. wretched peasant never for s moment imagined that he was doing harm to Bridget Cleary. He thought the real Bridget bad been spirited away, and that ehe would “come down the chimney ” when the changeling was burnt. Now, itis surely clear that a man sunk in such gross superstition is no more responsible for his actions than a criminal lunatic. No tribunal would send a lunatic to penal servitude for twenty years. The weak- ness of the law in the Clonmel case was shown by the conviction for manslaughter. If Cleary was to be regarded as a deliberate criminal, he ought to have been convicted of murder. ‘The aathori- ties shrank from the idea of hanging a man who killed his wife when under the impression that he was actually rescuing her from witheraft ; but it is plain that the compromise ought not to have stopped here. If the burning of Bridget Cleary was not murder, there is no logical consistency in treating it es manslaughter because the husband could not be held responsible for the capital crime. To punish sheer ignorance with twenty years’ penal servitude, when you do not punish it with the gallows, is bad law and bad morals. Mr. Clodd suggests that the real blame for the Clonmel tragedy rests on the spiritual pastors of the people. “It will occur to many that for the survival of such superstitions the responsibility should be shared by the Christian orgavisations which surround these poer peasants of Ballybadies.” Weare afraid that the teaching of the Roman Catholic priesthood in Ireland is not always conducive to pure reason, and that the of superstition is thickened by Bome beliefs. “Al any’ rate, a amount of discredit rests on the civilising agencies of Clonmel, and if they have failed to make Michael Cleary understand that he must not burn his wife with the idea that she is a changeling, why should he suffer twenty years’ penal servitude for their neglect or incapacity? If lunacy is a plea against punishment, ignorance strong of the type is a plea equally

Mr Edward Clodd, the president of the Folk Lore Society, puts forward a plea for Cleary, the Irishman who burned his wife, which, though reasonable enough, is hardly likely to have much ellect during the turmoil of a General Election. Cleary was sentenced to twenty years’ penal servitude for being the victim of deeply tooted Irish superstition that “when illness of a wasting or mysterious kind overtakes person the real individual has been spirited away the fairies, and a changeling resembling the perspn substituted.” When we recall the fact that the Church witches” to death two centuries ago ami that an eminent and learned like Sir William Blnckstone late as 176.1 wrote “that to deny the existence of witchcraft sorcery flatly to contradict the revered of Gptf,” th« crime of Cleary, the iieasant, is not so unfavourable as it might segui on the surface.

*Widely syndicated*

The sentence of 20 years' penal servitude on Michael Cleary, the chief actor in the appalling case of "witch-burning" at Clonmel, has provoked the intervention of Mr. Edward Clodd, the President of the Folk Lore Society. Mr. Clodd urges that Michael Cleary played his part in that terrible tragedy in the belief that his victim was not his wife, but a “changeling." The details of the heartrending story make it clear that the wretched man thought he was defeating the powers of evil in what he did. Twenty years' penal servitude for an action, however diabolical, that has its root in ignorance and superstition, and is not criminal in intent, is too severe a punishment. We (Star) think with Mr. Clodd that this sentence should be revised. It may have been necessary to pass the sentence to shew that men may not inflict horrible tortures on othera, even in the belief that they are recovering them from evil spirits. This case should do much to kill the ghastly superstition in Ireland, but Cleary inspires our pity as well our horror, and in his case clemency would be wise.

THE IRISH CHANGELING BURNERS. TO THE EDITOR. Sir,— It is probable that most students of superstition will agree with Mr. Clodd in hoping that, if possible, the sentence of Cleary may be mitigated. If ever a man "knew not what he did" it was, apparently, this unhappy peasant. He was in the mental condition of some natives of India, so described by Mr. Knighton in an article on "Demoniacal Possession in India" (*Nineteenth Century*, October, 1880). An exorcist at Ghonspore thus reports his method:— "I tied her hands behind her. I tied her feet. Cotton wicks steeped in oil were prepared. They were lighted, and stuffed up nostrils and into her. It cured her." The sufferer, named Melata, comfirmed this account. The Chinese usually drive out the devil (if they do not worship him) with needles (Nevins: "Demon Possession in China"). In Ireland the victim was not supposed to be poisoned by a fiend, but actually to be a new substituted unearthly person, beyond protection of human law. If no doubt exists as be the presence of this belief the crime of Cleary becomes a misfortune, the result, as it were of invincible ignorance. The law cannot make allowances for such ignorance but pity may, perhaps, be permitted to plead for one already punished by the discovery of his own horrible and all but incredible error. A punishment sufficient to mark and blazon abroad the law's sense of the nature of the act, and of the widespread Irish belief which suggested it, might perhaps be enough. That the belief is still common, Mr. Jeremiah Curtin shows in his recent Work on "Irish Ghost and Fairy Lore." I remain obediently yours, ANDREW LANG

Although the evidence goes to show that the belief in "changelings" exists among the Irish peasantry, and has led to inhuman acts, it appears certain that other and wholly base motives prompted the murder of Bridget Cleary, and the council of this society agrees with me that the case does not warrant action with a view to obtain mitigation of the sentences. —I am, Sir, your obedient servant, EDWARD CLODD, President of the Folk Lore Society, 11, Old-square, Lincoln's-inn, July 31.

We congratulate Mr. Edward Clodd, the President of the Folk Lore Society, on having arrived at a more sensible state of mind with regard to the Clonmel witch-burning case. Actuated by the belief that the barbarous murder of Bridget Cleary was due to the prevalence of the “changeling” superstition, Mr. Clodd protested against the infliction of a twenty years’ sentence on the principal culprit. But the foreman of the jury which tried tho case has furnished him with a full report of the evidence at the trial, and a perusal of it has sufficed to convince Mr. Clodd that "other and wholly base motives" were responsible for the crime. In common with the criminal he has learned that a little folk-lore is dangerous thing.

A CORRESPONDENT of the Spectator, referring to the shocking "witchcraft" case in Clonmel, maintains that Mrs. Cleary did not meet with her end owing to the belief in witchcraft or in demoniacal possession which has real hold in Ireland. "She perished," the correspondent says, "owing to the belief in the fairies. In Munster, when a child appears delicate, or a young woman consumptive or hysterical, the conclusion often is that the child or the woman has been carried off by the fairies, to be made a playmate or nurse to the young fairies, and that a fairy substitute resembling the person taken away is deposited in their place, which gradually declines, and ultimately dies. The belief is that if the changeling be tortured by fire its fairy parents will hear its cries, rush to its aid, curry it back to fairyland, and at the same moment restore the real person who will be found sleepingcalmly in the bed. Cleary and 'the neighbours' evidently believed that the being they tortured was not Cleary's wife, but a changeling. He addressed her, 'In the name of God, are you Bridget Boland?' (her maiden name), believing that thus adjured the being would confess it was a fairy. Again, after the burning, many of the men of the locality sat up all night in a 'fort' (earth embankment of ancient Irish village), armed with blackhandled knives. These poor people thought that a fairy procession would pass by, that in he midst would be Mrs. Cleary riding on a grey horse, and that if anyone rushed forward and cut her bonds with a black-handled knife (a potent weapon against all evil spirits), she would at once be restored to the world. In the 'Tales of Terror and Wonder' it was thus that Fair Janet rescued Tam Lin from fairies. She sat at Giles Cross on Halloween, at the 'murk and midnight hour,' when she sees the fairy host go by:

'First she let the black pass by,  
And net she let the brown,  
But quickly ran to the milk-white steed,  
And drew rider down.'

Thus Fair Janet rescued Tam Lin; thus the poor dwellers on the slope of Shore-na-mon (the Witches' Hill, a haunted mountain) believed that they would rescue Bridget Cleary."

The Tipperary "Bewitched" Case.

(SPECIAL: TO THE EVENING TELEGRAPH.)

TO DO

The recent terrible occurrence near Clonmel has revived in some measure the memory of the ancient cruelties in connection with witchcraft, a belief in which was one of the most persiment of the euperstitione of the world. Other superstitions died sway under the influence of advancing knowledge, but this showed the greatest vitality even in the minds of educated persons. The belief in witches cannot be said in any degree to have arisen with Christianity. In fact it bears on the fate of it the strongest evidence of being a pagan survival. Amongst the pagans it was the power of some one of the gods which was sought to be invoked. In later times the devil was subqituted, and with this superstition the belief in. changelings, namely, the abstraction id 'child and the substitution of a fairy wearing the sauna ham, seems to be closely connected. Beliefs of this kind seem to have been universal, and the allusions to them in English literature are very frequent. In "The !Midsummer Nigher, Dream" Shakespeare makes nine quarrel between Oberon and Tlteuta turn upon the question of the possession of a changing bey", whose mother was a witch and votaress of the fairy queen. In " Macbeth," es every one recoileets, the witches till a large space, and their incantedons are described in great detaiL In feet the Great Bard, in a very large number of his playa, made a most libel al use of the witch and the fairy for dramatic par. poses. The accounts of the machinations of the witches in Macbeth, however, were drawn from older source., and the notion of wearing away the life of a person by constructing images winch were gradually destroyed, the object of the witchcraft being supposed to decline away and die at the sanie time, may be traced to very ancient times. Horace, indeed, mentions very similar proeeedinas on the part if witches. and reference to incantations a like kind are foun' in other ancient authors. In one form or another the idea came down the centuries, and was tho *object in the nixt•enth wnd seventeenth centuries in England. Scot. laud was before that time the abiding place of witches, warlocks, and professors or demonology. When James VI of Sootland beuame James l of England he brought the metitutson of witch-hunt. ing along with him. He himself wrote a " Treatise on Demonologie," with a view to resolve the doubting hearts of many as to the fearful abounding of those detestable slaves of she devil, witches or en• chanters." In this treatne, which is in the'! form of a dialogue, it is declared that " no I one, age, nor rank should be excused from the punishment of death, according to the laws of Gad, the civil and imperial law, and! the municipal laws of all Christian nations."! Then the question is, "What to judged ' death I pray you l" to which the answer was, " It is rommonlie used by lyre, but there is an indifferent thing to be used in every country. sometime to the law and costume thereof." James put his "law and customs" int, practice extensively, and hen. deeds of people were burned or hanged. The trade witch-hunting became a regular one, espeoial]y as there was a reward of twenty. shillings for every witch brought to "justice." One of the most celebrated witch-hunters was one Mathew Hopkins, of Essex, who is mid in one year to hare procured the execution of no lees than GO reputed witches. Most of the evidence upon which this and similar radians I procured these judicial murders was, sr l course, either perjured or so trivial that! ! only a superstitious age would attach any importance to it. Hopkins pretended to be able to recognise the Tecial marks of witches, which were moles, acorbutic blotches, and warts, that frequently grow large and pendulous in old age, but whims it was pretended were teats to suckle imps. A favourite method of test was to tie together the thumbs and tom of suspected persons and drop them into a deep river or pond. If they sank they were assumed to be innocent and were only drowned. If by any superhuman exertion they succeeded in keeping afloat they were held guilty and taken out to be burned or hanged. In teeny cases• however. really credible evidence was presented of attempts at witchcraft. So deeply was the whole public mind tilled with the ides that enchantments were possible, that wicked persona, no doubt, did their best to till the role of witches. They practised incantations and supposed magic arts in color to injure or kill their neighbours, and really supposed themselves capable of mysterious end magical powers. No doubt, as these were criminals in intent, considering the rough justice of the time. eociety did not lose much by their removal. The Celle of the Lancashire witches in 1612 an instance of this. l'hsse people played the role of witches apparently in order to frighten their neigh-i hours, and then they deceived themselves. They were finally, to the number .•f ten, excoated on the testimony of a grandchild of oat of them, of ems. years of age, whose imagination had apparently been ins- ' pressed, and who gave an account how the devil in the shape of a Mack dog had appeared to his grandmother.

The Lady Alice was charged with having " swept the streets of Kilkeanie between complains end twilight, raking all the filth towards the dooms of her sonne William Outlaws, murmuring secretlie with Mr •elfe these words:— "To the hones of William my .10111 M Hie all the wealth of Blithest& town."

The bishop in the end had the wont of it, however, for we learn that at the instance of Arnold le Poer, then seneschal of Kilkenny. the prisoner was released. and " afterwards corrupted she seneschal with bribes to prosecute the bishop that he thrust hair into prison for three months." All the.. proceedings, however, happened as far back 1724, ho that the dust of the middle ages may be and to be upon thorn, Since then witch burning and persocutionlhan no place in Irishiannals.

The belief in changelings, which was eon. mon to nearly all them of consumption in the young, has now practically died out, and those wic know she peasantry ban were amazed and shocked to find the Channel eats turning up to demonstrate that these old beliefs die hard. The Cleary case seems to be a intxuar• of the witch and fairy theories, benne* the ancient superstition about cheogelmas seemed to here been entirely concerned with young persona.

All the folk stories usually thcord that the moment the red shovel wee produced the fairy fled, without !waiting for any further test, and the child ism restored.

It is by no means to be sup_ posed however, that this is an isolated case. lu 1866 a poor Frenchman was drowned in Essex, being "swam by a nob who Whined him to bo • warlock."

TO DO

"WITCH-BURNING" CASE. COMMITTAL OF THE PRISONERS. At the resumed hearing on Saturday of the charges against the prisoners accused of burning Bridget Cleary Clonmel, the evidence of the deceased woman's tathar incriminating the has"band was read over. Cieary meanwhile terribly excited, denying that the fathers evidence was true. He called the other prisonere a "rotten crowd," and said that if did not get justice there he would get it in heaven. The prisoners, Mary Kennedy, John Dunne, and Pat) Kennedy made statements supporting what had been said by the father. They declared that Uleary went out and dug hole as a grave. Pat Kennedy first refused to help, but on being threatened with a knife consented. They rolled the body a sheet and bag and put it in hole, Cleary forcing down the body with his foe*, Next day said to John l)unne is was not his wife, but a witch he had burned. Daring the making of the several statements the other prisoners stood apart from Cleary in the dock. All the prisoners were committed for trial the capital charge. " R.A.," writing the Spectator, referring to the above case, maintains that Mrs. Cleary did meet with her end owing to the belief witchcraft or demoniacal expression, which has real hold in Ireland. " She perished,' •■'R, A." says, " owing to the belief in the fairies.

The belief is that it the changeling be tortured by fire its fairy parents will hear its cries, rush to its aid, carry it to fairyland, and at the same moment restore the real person, who will be found sleeping calmly the bed.

Changelings. —Why are stunted and idiotical children called changelings? —Because was popularly believed that all the fairy children were a little backward of their tongue, and seemingly idiots, and that such children had been changed the fairies. Mr. Pennant, speaking of the fairy oak at Whiteford, relates that poor cottager, who lived near the oak, had a child which grew uncommonly peevish; the parents attributed this to the fairies, and imagined that was changeling. They took the child, put it in cradle, and left it all night beneath the tree, in hopes that the "tylwydd tag," or family of the fairy folk, would restore their own before morning. When morning came they found the child perfectly quiet, and so went away with it quite confirmed in their belief. *Knowledge for the People.*

A FAIRY LEGEND [BY CROFTON CROKER]

It may be considered impertinent were I to explain what is meant by a changeling: both Shakspeare and Spencer have already done so; and who is there unacquainted with the *Midsummer Night's Dream* and the *Fairy Queen*?

Now Mrs. Sullivan fancied that her youngest child had been changed by "faries, theft," to use Spencer's words, and certainly appearances warranted such a conclusion; for in one night her healthy, blue-eyed boy, had become shrivelled up into almost nothing, and never ceased squalling and crying. This naturally made poor Mrs. Sullivan very unhappy; and all the neighbours, by way of comforting her, said that her own child was, beyond any kind of doubt, with the good people, and that one of themselves had been put in his place.

Mrs. Sullivan, of course, could not disbelieve what every one told her, but she did not wish to hurt the thing; for although its face was so withered and its body wasted away to a mere skeleton, it had still a strong resemblance to her own boy; she therefore could not find it in her heart to roast it alive on the griddle, or to burn his nose off with the red-hot tongs, or to throw it out in the snow in the road-side, notwithstanding these, and several like proceedings, were strongly recommended to her for the recovery of her child.

One day, who should Mrs. Sullivan meet but a cunning woman, well known about the country by the name of Ellen Leah (or Grey Ellen). She had the gift, however she got it, of telling where the dead were, and what was good for the rest of their souls; and could charm away warts and wens, and do a great many wonderful things of the same nature.

"You're in grief this morning, Mrs. Sullivan," were the first words of Ellen Leah to her.

"You may say that, Ellen," said Mrs. Sullivan; "and good cause I have to be in grief; for there was my own fine child whipped off from me out of his cradle, without as much as by your leave or ask your pardon, and an ugly dony bit of a shrivelled-up fairy put in his place. No wonder that you see me in grief, Ellen."

"Small blame to you, Mrs. Sullivan," said Ellen Leah; "but are you sure 'tis a fairy?"

"Sure!" echoed Mrs. Sullivan, "sure enough am I to my sorrow, and can I doubt my own two eyes? Every mother's soul must feel for me."

"Will you take an old woman's advice;" said Ellen Leah, fixing her wild and mysterious gaze upon the unhappy mother: and, after a pause, she added, "but may be you'll call it foolish?"

"Can you get me back my child — my own child, Ellen?" said Mrs. Sullivan with great energy.

"If you do as I bid you," returned Ellen Leah, "you'll know." Mrs. Sullivan was silent in expectation, and Ellen continued— "Put down the big pot, full of water, on the fire, and make it boil like mad; then get a dozen new-laid eggs, break them, and keep the shells, but throw away the rest; when that is done, put the shells in the pot of boiling water, and you will soon know whether it is your own boy or a fairy. If you find that it is a fairy in the cradle, take the red bot poker and cram it down his ugly throat; and you will not have much trouble with him after that I promise you."

Home went Mrs. Sullivan, and did as Ellen Leah desired. She put the pot on the fire, and plenty of turf under it, and set the water boiling at such a rate, that if ever water was red hot, it surely was.

The child was lying, for a wonder, quite easy and quiet in the cradle, every now and then cocking his eye, that would twinkle as keen as a star on a frosty night, over at the great fire, and the big pot upon it; and he looked on with great attention at Mrs. Sullivan breaking the eggs, and putting down the eggshells to boil. At last he asked, with the voice of a very old man, "What are you doing, mammy?"

Mrs. Sullivan's heart, as she said herself, was up in her mouth, ready to choke her, at hearing the child speak. But she contrived to put the poker in the fire, and to answer without making any wonder at the words, "I'm brewing, *a vick*" (my son).

"And what are you brewing mammy?" said the little imp:whose supernatural gift of speech now proved beyond question that he was a fairy substitute.

"I wish the poker was red," thought Mrs. Sullivan; but it was a large one, and took a long time heating; so she determined to keep him in talk until the poker was in a proper state to thrust down his throat, and therefore repeated the question.

"Is it what I'm brewing, *a vick*," said she "you want to know?"

"Yes, mammy: what are you brewing?" returned the fairy.

"Egg-shells , *a vick*," said Mrs. Sullivan.

"Oh!" shrieked the imp, starting up in the cradle, and clapping his hands together, "I'm fifteen hundred years in the world, and I never saw a brewery of egg-shells before!" The poker was by this time quite red, and Mrs. Sullivan seizing it, ran furiously towards the cradle; but somehow or other he foot slipped, and she fell flat on the floor, and the poker flew out of her hand to the other end of the house. However, she got up, sithout much loss of time, and went to the cradle intending to pitch the wicked thing that was in it into the pot of boiling-water; when there she saw her own child in a sweet sleep, one of his soft round arms rested upon the pillow: his features were as placid as if their repose had never been disturbed, save the rosy mouth which moved with a gentle and regular breathing.

Who can tell the feelings of a mother when she looks upon her sleeping child. Why should I, therefore, endeavour to describe those of Mrs. Sullivan at again beholding her long-lost boy? The fountain of her heart overflowed with the excess of joy, and she wept; tears trickled silently down ber cheeks, nor did she strive to check them — they were tears not of sorrow but of happiness.

CHANGELINGS BY ANDREW LANG.

The late melancholy events in a peasant family of Tipperary have not only pained and grieved all readers, but have astonished the student of popular beliefs. Not many years ago an unhappy infant was savagely ill-treated by his parents, who had no idea that they were harming their own child, but supposed that they were merely exorcising a substituted fairy brat, a "changeling." In the recent case the actors appear to have been blinded by the same illusions, only in this affair a changeling was thought to have been left in the room of grown-up woman.

This is a singular and, perhaps, unprecedented instance of the fairy belief producing deplorable results in modern practice. It may be worth while to look more closely into an old popular creed, which astonishes us by its persistence. That there exists a subterranean and usually invisible race, akin to our own, which sometimes carries off human prisoners for ever, or till their release, is most ancient opinion. Probably the Rape of Proserpine is our earliest classical instance, and it has a close analogy in the North American myth of Chibiabos, carried off, like Proserpine, by the subterranean folk, and, like her, partially restored: after which, Eleusis, the Mysteries were founded. On the face of it, both fables seem intended to describe the death of vegetation, and its revival in spring. No doubt it may be argued that the belief had no other foundation, and only later was applied to the fairy captures of men, women, and children. But in the origin of *these* tales there must be a more human element. The fairies, who in one form or another people the traditions of almost all known races, are in one respect only ancestral ghosts, living in a blades which is neither heaven, hell, nor purgatory. Among Christian peoples, apparently, the old heathen belief in these shades existed, and, indeed, still exists, behind or beneath the Church's creed to the condition of the baptised dead. A dead man or woman or child usually goes to his own Christian place, but occasionally, oven in lifetime, is carried off by the fairies— that is, practically, the ancestors. But this mortuary character of the fairies is much obscured for us by the confusion of the shades with sportive pixies and little folk spirits unattached, who never were souls of mortals. The fairies of our fairy tales, again, who are generally rather moral and benevolent creatures, may be little older than the end of the seventeenth century, when they received their characteristics from the fancy of Perrault and Madame d'Aulnoy. A godmother of the Maid of Orleans had seen *Fées* beneath the *Beau Mai*, the old oaktree of Domremy. But of fairy godmothers like Cinderella's the children of Domremy probably never 'd. However, into our conceptions of fairies all these and other different classes of fanciful beings are now combined, and that is why we feel it is difficult to understand the most cruel and mournful Irish tragedy.

The unhappy peasants believed that the real woman was under fairy dominion, in fairy realms forlorn, that she would ride a grey horse in the fairy cavalcade, and might be rescued by friends wearing black-hilted knives. In exactly the same way, according to the legend of Aberfoyle, the minister, Mr. Kirk, might have been released had anyone thrown dirk over his head when ho once appeared at a christening party, after his capture by the People of Peace, two hundred years ago. In the old ballad, too, the captive Tamlane may be delivered by anyone who will tear him off the white horse which he rides among the elves. Mr. Kirk himself, in manuscript diary, admits that he is aware of methods by which a prisoner of the fays may be released, but he regards them "superstitions." also, in the same manuscript, speaks of a woman who, after two years' residence in fairyland, was restored to her husband. Gervase of Tilbury long before had recorded similar facts in his "Otia Imperialia." But while in the case of infants the fairies used to leave changeling brat behind, they did not do so when they stole grown-up people, or at least we do not hear of this belief in Scotland. Unluckily, events prove, the opposite belief does exist in Tipperary, and we know too well what came of it. The natural origin of a faith so monstrous is probably not very far to seek. We often talk of this or that person as "a changed man." The primitive explanation of a sudden revolution in character and habits —caused perhaps by disease, by a sunstroke, or other accidents— would be that the man really had been changed, that somebody else had been substituted for him. Thus we have the familiar Chinese tale of the stupid idle lad who suddenly became studious and got a high degree. Of course a friendly ghost had taken his place, say the Chinese, and the fairies who make captures in Ireland or Scotland are, at bottom, only ancestral ghosts. When healthy good-tempered child became peevish, insatiable, bag of skin and bones, clearly he was not the actual child in a decline, but a substituted fairy brat, who had better be roasted on a shovel.

This is intelligible enough, but in most countries men and women, when stolen by fairies, are *not* replaced by changelings. One may venture a guess as to what had really occurred in their case. Physicians, I believe, are not unacquainted with rare instances in which a secondary personality—hysterical, epileptic, or what not—is developed adults. The patient, forgetting who he is and assuming his new personality, is apt to wander away, and perhaps behaves sanely enough at a distance under a changed name and in a fresh occupation. One American case, of a minister (I think) who disappeared and became a tradesman in a remote place, has been published. But an acute American physician has observed that, on the day of his disappearance, this patient had a considerable sum of ready money in his possession! This assuredly does throw a grave doubt on the theory of unconscious and unpremeditated action on his part. The case of "Louis Y.," a man of about three distinct personalities, is familiar to students of morbid psychology. In each of his states he only remembers the prior events of the analogous condition: in one frame he is an atheistic Eadical, in another pious Tory, and he has certainly wandered a good deal in all senses. "If his *bona fides* are admitted" (to quote an author of scanty classical education), such a patient as "Louis Y." is probably the kind of person who gave rise to the belief in fairy captures of adults. He went off, was lost, was somebody else for while, and then he came back in his own familiar personality. Where had he been? *He* did not know — nobody knew; and the Good People were made responsible for that and doubtless for premeditated and conscious disappearances. The Highlander in Mr. Kirk's manuscript, who took back a wife "after two years in Fairyland" was easily satisfied by her explanation of her absence. We can say no more. In the recent Irish tragedy it is not unlikely that the unfortunate woman really had developed some hysterical change in character. But she did not wholly disappear into fairyland, therefore what was left in her place was a changeling. Catholics ought to have called in the aid of a clerical exorcist, when all would have been well. But "the priest is often the last to hear of these things," and recourse was had to the prescriptions of ancient folklore. Peasants are not alone here. As I write comes in the advertisement of book, "Demon Possession and Allied Themes," by Dr. Nevius, "for forty years missionary to the Chinese." "This book is based ... upon a large collection of thoroughly sifted and authenticated facts, showing that demon possession is a common experience of our own day." I cannot criticise a work which I have not read, but I wish that a form of Dr. Nevius's theory had not prevailed in Tipperary.

Sketches of Superstitions
Popular Fancies of the Irish
(From Chamber's Edinburgh Journal)

Ireland has long teemed with superstitions of the wildest and most imaginative cast. Indeed, up to the present day, civilisation has been more ineffective in rooting them out from that country than from any other that can pretend to a place among the de-barbarised regions of the earth. In the western and south-western provinces of the island, in particular, the people still cling tenaciously the superstitions of their forefathers; and of this fact not only the narratives of tourists, but the records of justiciary courts, afford many recent proofs. Deaths are yet not unfrequently occasioned by children being dipped in rivers and sainted wells to cure them of being *fairy stricken*; and young women labouring under severe puerperal illness are often allowed to perish from inattention, because their friends regard them changelings, the real parties being carried off, according to the general belief, to serve as nurses *infant fairies*. Ireland being still in this condition, it is obvions that this inquirer into the superstitions of that island must enjoy great advantage over those who but rake up the ashes, it were, of similar follies, in places where they have been long extinct. Mr. T. Crofton Croker has indeed shown this to be the case, most convincingly, in his three entertaining volumes on the "Fairy Legends and Traditions" of his native land. To this work, the most ample existing repertory of knowledge on the subject, and the essay Dr. Grimm of Gottingen, printed along with with it, we are happy to acknowledge large obligations in drawing the following account of the superstitions of Ireland.

In addition to that übiquitous supernatural race, entitled *good people*, *elves*, or *fairies* towhom the same characters of diminutive stature, beauty of person, social habits, and mixed qualities of disposition, are every where ascribed, the Irish have long put faith in the existence of various other supernatural tribes, of which traces are to be found in different countries, but which have characters peculiarly well-marked in the Green Isle. The most prominent of these spirits are the *cluricaune*, the *banshee*, the *phooka*, the *merrow*, the *dullahon*, and the *fir-derrig*. Before the strange habits ascribed to these imaginary beings are adverted to, it may be observed regarding the elves, that the Irish, like most other nations, believe in the existence of two kinds, good and evil. The good elf or fairy is called *shefro*, *she* or *shighe* being the root of the term, as is partly shown by the word ban*she*. Even the shefros have dark shades in their character; as, though they sometimes confer benefits on mortals, they steal children and nursingwomen, and all their beauty and the splendour of their dwellings are regarded illusory, they being really old and ugly, and their palaces hovels.— But the worse species of elf, styled in Irish the *leprachan**, is all evil together‚—in short, a malicious demon. Ireland is rife with stories of the mischiefs brought by the leprachan on poor men, their crops, cattle, and families.

The *cluricaune* unlike the elf, is altogether solitary being. He presents, when seen, the comical appearance of a little old man, with a peagreen coat adotned by large buttons, broad shoebuckles, and cocked hat of the old French cut. He is perpetually found smoking and drinking, and his favourite resting position is on the top of cask in some well-filled cellar. He seldom exhibits himself wilfully, but is sometimes caught unexpectedly by the eyes of mortals, and on such occasions, people who are knowing in those matters endeavour to seize him, for he has properties which makes him most valuable servant. The cluricaune has a purse about him containing *one shilling*, and if any one can get hold of that purse and coin, gets treasure indeed, for, when paid away, the shilling always returns to the purse. But the cluricaune is commonly too old, or too tricky, for his captors. He carries about with him a double of the magic purse, and when people think they have the real shilling, behold they have only current coin of the realm, which, goodness knows, is very unapt return if once sent away! Then the tricksy spirit will strive make his captor turn his head to look at something or other and if this is once done, by the laws of cluricaune existence, the spirit can make himself invisible, and nothing will be heard more of him, but his mocking laugh of triumph at his escape. Again, if he is compelled to point out where treasures lie, he urges his mortal captor to mark the place with a stone, or some such thing. If this be done, the vainly triumphing mortal, when he returns with his spade to the place, will find a dozen marks instead of one, and will again get nothing for his pains but the pleasure of hearing the mocking "ha! ha!" of the cluricaune.

Though a valuable servant, if rightly managed the cluricaune is very bad master. Like the  *nis* of Germany, he sometimes attaches himself to a particular family, and domineers over them in the most intolerable way, being ejectible neither by bell, book, nor candle, coaxing, nor abuse. In some of the former sketches upon this subject, it was mentioned that an Irish gentleman, who was troubled with a familiar, thought to get rid of it by removal to another house, but was shocked, on the morning of the flitting, to hear a voice exclaim from the bung-hole of cask, on one of the loaded carts, "Here we go, master! here we go — all together!" What! are you there too then we may as well stay where we are. Unpack the carts." The cluricaune was the familiar spirit who had the honour to figure on this occasion, as he has done many similar ones, according to the creed of Ireland.

The banshee is also a spirit which attaches itself to particular families, but of a very different character from the cluricaune. The banshee is not a spirit of fun and trickery, but of gloom and death. *Bean-shighe*, signifying *she-fairy*, is understood to be the uncorrupted form the term.— This spirit attends on some particular house, ...

MANX SUPERSTITIONS

Another instance they gave me to prove the reality of fairies was of a fiddler, who, having agreed with a person, who was a stranger, for so much money, to play to some company he should bring him to, all the twelve days of Christmas, and received earnest for it, saw his new master vanish into the earth the moment he had made the bargain. Nothing could be more terrified than was the poor fiddler. He found he had entered himself into the devil's service, and looked on himself as already damned; but having recourse to a Clergyman he received some hope: he ordered him, however, as he had taken earnest, to go when he should be called; but that, whatever tunes should he called for, to play none but psalms. On the day appointed the same person appeared, with whom he went, though with what inward reluctance tis easy to guess; but punctually obeying the Minister's directions, the company to whom he played were so angry that they all vanished at once. leaving him at the top of a high hill, and so bruised and hurt, though he was not sensible when or from what hand he received the blows, that he got not home without the utmost difficulty. — The old story of infants being changed in their cradles is here in such credit that mothers are in continual terror at the thoughts of it. I was prevailed upon myself to go and see a child who they told me was one of these changelings; and, indeed, must own was not a little surprised as well as shocked at the sight; nothing uuder heaven could have a more beautiful face; but though between five and six years old, and seemingly healthy, he was so far from being able to walk or stand, that he could not so much as move any one joint; his limbs were vastly long for his age, but smaller than an infant's of six months; his complexion was perfectly delicate, and he had the finest hair in the world; he never spoke nor cried, ate scarce any thing, and was very seldom seen to smile; but if any one called him a fairy-elf he would frown and fix his eyes so earnestly on those who said it as if he would look them through. His mother, or at least his supposed mother, being very poor, frequently went out a charing, and left him a whole day together; the neighbours, out of curiosity, have often looked in at the window to see how he behaved when alone; which, whenever they did, they were sure to find him laughing, and in the utmost delight. This made them judge that he was not without company more pleasing to him than any mortals could be; and what made this conjecture seem the more reasonable was, that if he were left ever so dirty, the woman, at her return, saw him with a clean face, and his hair combed with the utmost exactness and nicety. — (*Notes to the New Edition of Peveril the Peak.*)

TO DO

COUNTY OF ARMAGH ASSIZES.

MURDER OF A CHILD BY HIS FATHER.

*John Blakely* was arraigned for the murder of his son, Felix Blakely, a child of 6 or 7 years, at Armagh, on the 1st of March, by strangulation with his hands, and other violence. The prisoner pleaded not guilty. The prisoner being too poor to engage professional assistance, his Lordship assigned Mr. Blacker as his Counsel.

Ann Finlay deposed— I know John Blakely, and knew a woman named Mary Turley. She and prisoner lived together, but she is now dead. They had four or five children—one of them was named Feix; he was youngest but one. Mary Turley died in confinement of the second child after Felix. Only one of children is now alive—a little girl. I did not see Felix for two months before he was founn dead. Before his death he and his father lived for a fortnight in William Rainey's, Armagh. I sent the child home to his father, at Rainey's, a fortnight before he (the father) said he took him to a lodging in the conntry. I sent the child home on a Sunday, and saw it alive, for the last time, on the following Tesday, at Rainey's. The child had had the small-pox, and afterwards a bowel complaint, for 16 weeks before I sent him away—he had not then recovered. He lost the sight of one of his eyes in the small-pox. On the right foot the second toe decayed from the same disease. After the child's death, I saw is body in Armagh infirmary. After I heard the child was dead, I went to prisoner, at James Molholland's, where he was working. I inquired if it was the dead body of Felix that had been brought in? He made no answer for about five or ten minutes. He then said "What could he do with it? (the child). Sure he was tormented with the trouble it gave to every body—no one would take his week's earning to take care of it." "John (said I) had you not (you should not have) done what you have done. I never brought a blush to jour face (craved you) for all the trouble it gave me. I would have begged the world with it to take care of it." (Witness here shed tears.) To Mr. BLACKER— I told prisoner that if he had killed the child, all Ireland could not save him, and that "he had better make his road good." Before the child took the small pox it was a healthy, fine child. I know Mrs. Rainey— she is rather a passionate woman. The report was, that she alleged she had no luck in selling anything in her shop, from the time it came about the house, because it was "bewitched like." The opinion of the country-people is, that a bewitched child is a sickly one which has been left in place of a fine child taken away by the fairies. It was reported that Mrs. Rainey advised the prisoner to take the head off the child, and throw it behind the fire. To a Juror— I am sister to the prisoner.— [Witness here cried bitterly, and there *was a strong sensation in the Court.]

Elizabeth Rainey— I am the wife of William Rainey, and live in Armagh. I keep a huckstry. The prisoner lodged in my house for about a month. He left me on the Wednesday after Shrove Tuesday. When he had been with me for about a fortnight, his sister sent a child to him. It remained there for a fortnight. It slept with him and got its diet with him. It went by the name of Felix. On the Sunday evening before Shrove Tuesday, prisoner borrowed my apron, to put it about the child; and, after he had done so, he took the child and left the house, between seven and eight at night. He did not say where he was going. He returned in the inside of two hours, without the child, but bringing back the apron. I said to him, "John, what did the child say when you were leaving it?"- He replied, that it said nothing. I said, if they give it a fire, and a bit to eat, it would not give them much trouble, and he replied, "Not much." He then asked me for a drink; I told him I had no water except what was hot in the kettle. When prisoner took it away, it wore an old flannel petticoat, with a patch on it,—an old torn sarstet coat,—and an old black calico bib.— I never saw it alive, after that night. I saw the dead body of a child in the Infirmary, nearly five weeks afterwards. I think it was that of Felix Blakely— Dr Colvan, Ann Finlay (last witness), and a Mrs. Magill, were present. The prisoner remained in my house till the Wednesday after he took the child away. To Mr. BLACKER— I live in Lower Irish-street, Armagh. I am married, and have 5 children, from 3 to 15 years of age. The child was bare and hungry-looking; it had had the small-pox, and had got bad care in the disease. It had not the appearance of a child of seven years, being spent and sickly. It wats old-fashioned enough, however, both in look and conversation. It used to sit up on its "bunkers" at the fire, like an old man. It did not appear an idiot or a "natural." When the child had been a week in my house, I began to wish its father would provide another lodging for it. He said it was getting care enough; but that he had *a very good place for it*. I asked where the place was. He replied, "in Mick Duffy's, in Bannbrook," or "in the Shambles," I forget which. After I shut my shop of nights, I sometimes have a crack with my husband and a neighbour. We don't tell old stories, about fairies, and so on—how should I know anything about fairies? (laughter.) I never said any thing to prisoner about fairies,— I merely said to him, that his child was "not *right*-looking," and that it should be with me no longer; if it had had good clothes, it would have been like other children. I never called it a witch. I heard my children say, that, when it was up stairs, it used to sing foolish little songs, and that it played little tricks among the ashes, and was "bringing *wee things* (fairies) about the fire." I don't know what "wee things," or "wee people," are. I never saw the deceased child do more than play a little trick, as if to frighten the others. I often asked the prisoner to be allowed to give the child a halfpenny-worth of bread in the day, but he did not say he would permit me. I never told him the child would come to no good; but that if it got care it might thrive. He complained of it, and asked what he would do with it; and I told him he should let his sister keep it, and give her a shilling a-week for doing so. I swear, that I never said to hum, that I would take off its head, and throw it behind the fire. Prisoner said, that his sister should never get it. He had given the child its supper, before he rolled it up in my apron.

Abigail Magill—I lodged in Rainey's house, on the night that prisoner took the child away. After he returned, he came to my room, with a candle in his left hand, and asked for a drink of water. I told him where to get it, and he lifted two tinfulls with his right hand, which trembled in the act. I desired him to take a drink to the child. He said he left it in the country. I never saw the child alive, after that; but I saw its body in the Infirmary, after the doctors had sent for me. Before it died, there was a pearl on the right eye, and two of the toes had grown together in the small-pox. To Sir T. STAPLES— I saw the united toes of the dead body, and often while it was alive. (Witness described the clothes found on the body, and said she was sure they were the same as the child had worn when alive.) To Mr. BLACKER— When the prisoner told me he had left the child in the country, I had suspicions about it. I never heard quarrelliiug between Mrs. Rainey and prisoner, about the child. I didn't pay any heed to the idle stories of peeple who said the child was "so and so" (a changeling).

Robert Woods— I know Miss Lodge's grounds, about a mile from this town, I was there on 2d April, about eleven o'clock. In the gripe of a ditch, I observed the dead body of a child. It was wrapped in old clothes, and covered with some tufts of grass and fog. I went to Mr. Pooler, Miss Lodge's gardener, and told the circumstances. I next went to Rainey's, Steward to Miss Lodge. A man of Rainey's and I went to the ditch. In the course of the day an inquest was held on the body. Dr. Colvan attended. I saw the body removed from the ditch. There was an old, dirty cloth wrapped round the head, old flannel rolled round the body, and a black cloth round its neek. I heard that the body and clothes were removed to the Infirmary.

Joseph Barbour— I carried the dead body of a child from Miss Lodge's side of Mr. Dobbin's dam, to the Infirmary, and delivered it to the doctors.

John Colvan, Esq.—I am a physician and surgeon. On the 2d April last, I saw a dead body in Miss Lodge's grounds. The body was that of a child, of probably five or six years. I re-examinied the bodv at the Infirmary. It had the appearance of having been dead for a considerable time. Putrefaction had commenceed on the abdomen. It was a cold, dry tinme of the year, and the place where the body was found was a cool one. It might, therefore, have lain for a longer time than we could reasonably suppose. I named eight or ten days at the time of the inquest, as I was pressed for an opinion, but I thought it might have been dead much longer. My opinion is, that the child's death was occasioned by external violence. There was a large bruise betwixt the eyes, and one much larger on the right side of the throat. The tongue protruded partially from between the lips and teeth. From these marks, and from the apparent weak state of the child, I not only concluded that its death had been a violent one, but I was even led to form an opinion as to the mode of the death. The skeleton was that of an emaciated child; and, apparently, a little violence would have occasioned death. The wounds appeared to have been inflicted by some hard blunt substance. They might have been caused by a fall or a blow. I observed, on the right side of the head, the cicatrix of a large ulcer, which had denuded the bone.— The right eye was completely blind, from a disease we term stapholema, or projecting humour, and the-left eye was also injured from opacities of the cornea. Two of the toes on the right foot had run together, in healing from small-pox. It was I and an apprentice of mine, Mr. Davison, who lifted the body out of the ditch, and undressed it on the field. The clothes on the upper part seemed as if pinned round it; but those on the lower part were put on as they had been worn. To Mr. BLACKER— The body lay in the ditch with the face up. I did not find internal marks to occasion death. If the child had beon exposed to the inclemency of the air, for a short time, it would probably have died, after the infliction of the injuries. The wound betwixt the eyes was not a superficial one. The blood was effused into all the structures down to the bone, which was injured, but not brokon. In the other wounds, the blood was also effused into all the structures. I thought the wounds the only visible cause of death.

John Reavoy— I live in Portadown. In April last, I heard of a man's having killed a child at Armagh. I saw a person answering the description passing through Portadown, and gave information to the Captain of the Police, who ordered a party of his men to go with me. The man I refer to was the prisoner. When he saw us, he escaped into Mr. Shillington's timber, but was captured on the Lurgan road. He told Capt. Locke, that he lived in High street, Newry. I saw him again in the Police barrack. Capt. Locke warned him not to say any thing that might comnmit himself. My brother and I, Mick Cromey, and Corporal Daly, of the Police, were present with him in the barrack, afterwards. Mick Cromey and my brother asked him why he had killed the child. We could not get him stopped from making declaration of the facts. He gave himelf two or three names— one of which was Turley. He also said he had been bred at Sheepbridge.

John Wilson, Sub-Constable— It was I who arrested the prisoner. I found him lying in a Mr. Boyd's garden, at the end of Portadown, on 27th April. I told him there was a charge against him, and asked c1him where he lived. He said, in Newry, or its neighbourhood. He denied that he ever lived at Armagh.

Mr. BLACKER, for the defence, argued, that the evidence did not bear out the second count of the indictment, alleging strangulation as the cause of death; and quoted from Sir Gregory Lewin's Reports, in support of his argument. He also submitted, as to the first count, charging the death as occasioned by throwing the deceased down on the ground, &c., thereby giving him a mortal wound, that it did not appear, in the evidence of the surgeon, whether the mortal wound was occasioned by a blow, or by a fall on the ground; and he referred to a precedent given in the work already referred to, to shew, that this would not be sufficient to sustain the count.

Dr. Covan, recalled— My opinion as to the cause of death is this, that if life was lingering, after the violence, it may have been fniskhed or accelerated by the inclemency of the weather.

The witness's depositions were then read, where it appeared that he had alleged exposure to the inclemency of the weather as one of the causes of death.

Dr. Colvall— to the Court— The tongue of the deceased protruded, which indicated sufftocation— not strangulation. Strangulation is considered as effected by placing a substance tightly round the neek. Suffocation may be caused by pressing the hand against the throat, and squeezing the wind-pipe. Choking is properly the stopping of the oesophagus, by the presence of some extraneous suhstance.

Sir T. STAPLES quoted from *5 Carrington and Paine*, 121, as reported in *Roscoe on Evidence*, 650, to show the suffiiciery of the evidence to sustain the indictment, so far as regarded the acceptatiorn and admitted meaning of the terms choking ard strangulation.

Mr. HANNA, Q.C. cited from *Roscoe*, 651, to a similar effect.

The Court held the precedents good, but did not wish to preclude the prisoner the benefit of a future consideration of the point raised by his Counsel.

Mr. BLACKER then addressed the jury briefly on the part of the prisoner.

No witness were called for the defence.

His Lordship began his charge to the jury, and his recapitulation of the evidence, at five minutes past three o'clock, and concluded at a quarter past four. At five minutes to five the Jury returned to Court with a verdict of— guilty.

The prisoner did not evince any particular concern when the verdict was announced. He preserved a dogged, listless air during the whole trial; and on one or two occasions we caught him smiling, while chatting with a policeman and the jailers in the dock.— *Whig.*

FAIRY CHANGELINGS.

I have been told, says the Rev. John O'Hanlon, writing in 1865, of a circumstance occuring—one, too, in which the names of parties and places were mentioned— regarding a respectable farmer's family, on whom a changeling had been imposed, and in the following manner. A beautiful and healthy infant, sleeping with its mother, was thought to have been rudely snatched from her arms during the night; for, with the morning's dawn, a deformed and withered-looking old creature appeared instead. The child was doubtless attacked with some paralytic disease, which thus had suddenly changed its appearance. However, the parents, with all their friends and neighbours, were persuaded the child had been carried off to fairyland, whilst a fairy had been left to supply its place. The poor mother found this weakling, whom she still continued suckling, waste away her own strength, and she seemed last falling into decline. The child became remarkably peevish, would not look on "man nor mortal," and its piercing screams sounded so unearthly, that it was agreed all sides the services of fairy-woman would be required to recover the lost one. This matter was arranged with the greatest secrecy, lest it should come to the knowledge of the poor deformed creature, whose flesh became completely shrivelled and whose limbs had shrunk to the most attenuated dimensions. With her usual exorcisms and charms the fairy-woman employed put the supposed changeling a shovel, and afterwards left him on the dung-heap before the farmhouse offices, whilst he offered every resistance possible, and screamed with terrific cries. To the great delight of the mother and her friends, when going outside expecting the return of their lost darling, it lay on the same unsavoury dunghill—ruddy, plump, and smiling sweetly as of yore, the old man having altogether disappeared. So far as my recollection this story serves me, the child lived some time afterwards, yet died before it had attained the age of reason.— *The Gentleman's Magazine Library; English Tradition Lore.*

THE TALE OF CHANGELING.

Here is story told by Jane Propert, of Kington, in the hop-yard at Weobly in September, 1908. Jane believed the story, because she had it from "a woman who knew was true." It is taken from "The Folk-Lore of Herefordshire," by Ella Mary Leather (Sidgwick and Jackson):

A woman had a baby that never grew; it was always hungry, and never satisfied, but lay in its cradle year after year, never walking, and nothing seemed to do it good. Its face was hairy and strange-looking. One day the woman's elder son, a soldier, came home from the war, and was surprised to see his brother still in the cradle. But when he looked in he said, "That's not my brother, mother." "It is, indeed," said his mother. "We'll see about that," he said. So he obtained first a fresh egg and blew out the contents, filling the shell with malt and hops. Then he began to brew over the fire. At this a laugh came from the cradle. "I am old, old, ever old," said the changeling, "but I never saw a soldier brewing beer in an eggshell before!" Then he gave a terrible shriek, for the soldier went for him with whip, chasing him round and round the room what had never left his cradle. At last he vanished through the door, and when the soldier went out after him he met on the threshold his long-lost brother. He was man of twenty-four years of age, fine and healthy. The fairies had kept him in a beautiful place under the rocks, and fed him on the best of everything. He should never be as well off again, he said, but when his mother called he had to come home."

"The Fairies" in Clonmel.

On Saturday last two women named Anastatia Rourke and Ellen Cummins were brought from the gaol of Clonmel to the town hall, in custody, and were charged before the Mayor, Captain Morton, and Alderman Cantwell, with having on the 28th April last, wilfully and unlawfully burned John Dillon, aged three years, (committed to their care to noise) by placing him naked on a hot shovel, in the belief that he was an old man or a fairy left by the "good people" as a substitute for the real child, whom they had taken from its mother. It appeared in the course of the case that, as the child was pining, they believed, according to the barbarous superstition of some of the peasantry, that it was a fairy child which had become substituted for the previous healthy one; and measures were taken accordingly for dealing with the changeling by placing it on a red hot shovel. The evidence fully sustained the charge against Anastatia Bourke, who was sentenced to a weeks' imprisonment. The Mayor, in passing sentence, said that she was already a month in gaol, and the magistrates were of opinion an additional week's imprisonment would be sufficient to satisfy the ends of justice. It was a case of gross ignorance and gross superstition.

Nobody who knows Ireland will be much surprised at the circumstance that two women of Clonmel have been arrested on the charge of cruelly ill-treating child which they fancied was a changeling left by the fairies in place of the original child. Even in Scotland, where a tolerably stringent "Education Act" was passed as early as the year 1696, the fairy superstition survived far into the second half of the eighteenth century, if not later. Pennant, in his well-known Tour (published 1771-75) tells a story of a Breadalbane peasant who imagined that he was forcibly drawn into the society of the elfish folk. With them were mingled a crowd of men and women, many of whom he knew to have been dead for years. They did him no harm, except that a "female sprite" seems to have amused herself by tying his hair in double knots and otherwise making fun of him, "But it is incredible," adds Pennant, "the mischief these *agri somnia* did in the neighbourhood. The friends and neighbours of the deceased whom the old dreamer had named were in the utmost anxiety at finding them in such bad company in the other world; the almost extinct belief of the old idle tales began to gain ground, and the good minister will have many a weary discourse and exhortation before he can eradicate the absurd ideas this idle story has revived." Meanwhile the case of Ellen Cushion and Anastasia Rourke offers additional evidence—if any were needed —of the propriety of applying the same political measure to Tipperary as to Middlesex and Surrey.

SUPERSTITION IN IRELAND.

Ellen Cushion and Anastatia Rourke were arrested at Clonmel on Saturday charged with cruelly illtreating a child three years old, named Philip Dillon. The prisoners were taken before the mayor, when evidence was given showing an extraordinary survival of superstitious belief. It appeared that the neighbours fancied that the child, which had not the use of its limbs, was a changeling left by the fairies in exchange for the original child. While the mother was absent the prisoners entered her house and placed the child naked on a hot shovel, under the impression that this would break the charm. The child was severely burned, and is in precarious condition. The prisoners were remanded. They were hooted by the crowd.

We commend Ellen Cusheon and Anastasia Rourke to the attention of the Society for the Confinement of Lunatics. At Clonmel, it appears, there dwells little boy named Philip Dillon. It seems the neighbours fancied that the child, which had not the use of its limbs, was a changeling left by the fairies in exchangg for the original child while the mother was absent. The prisoners entered the mother's house, and placed the child naked on a hot shovel, under the impression that this would break the charm. The poor little thing was severely burnt, and is in a precarious condition. We are thankful that we do not reside Clonmel.

An Irish Superstition.—

A superstition, that to this day finds great credence among the peasantry Ireland, is that lighted candle placed in dead man's hand wili not be seen by any but those whom it is used; and that if a candle in a dead hand be introduced into a house, it will prevent those who may asleep within the house from waking. Within recent years a party of moonlighters. under the influence of this superstition, attacked the house of a farmer, lighting their way with a candle whose candlestick was man's hand. Unfortunately for the credit the creed, the inmates were alarmed and their assailants fled, leaving their dead hand behind them.

TRALEE ASSIZES. CHILD MURDER —HORRIBLE SUPERSTITION

*Ann Roche*, an old woman of very advanced age, was indicted for the murder of Michael Leahy, a young child, by drowning him in the Flesk. This case turned out to be a homicide committed under the delusion of the grossest superstition. The child, though four years old, could neither stand, walk, or speak— *it was thought to be Fairy-struck* —and the grand-mother ordered the prisoner and one of the witnesses, Mary Clifford, to bathe the child every morning, in that pool of the river Flesk, where the boundaries of three farms met; they had bathed it for three mornings running, and on the last morning the prisoner kept the child louger under the water than usual, when her companion (the witness, Mary Clifford) said to the prisoner, "how can you hope to ever see God after this," to which the prisoner replied, "that the sin was on the grandmother and not on her." — Upon cross-examination, the witness said it was not done with intent kill the child, but to cure it— *to put the Fairy out of it*.

The Policeman, who apprehended her, on charging her with drowning the child, she said it was no matter if it had died four years ago.

Baron Pennefather said, that he thought it was a case of suspicion, and required to be thoroughly examined into, yet the Jury would not be safe in convicting the prisoner of murder, however strong their suspicions might be. Verdict— Not Guilty.

MYSTERIOUS CHARGE OF MURDER. Tralee, Saturday, June 17.— An Inquest was held on Wednesday last, at Muckruss Abbey, near Killarney, before Eusebius M'Gillycuddy, Esq. one of the Coroners for this County, (assisted the Hon Thomas Brown, the Rev. A. Hyde, and George Cashell, Esqrs.. Magistrates) on the body of Michael Kelliher, a child of the age of between four and five years (a paralytic, helpless and disabled ricketty cripple) who, it is alleged, was murdered by drowning in the river Flesk, near that town on Monday last. The accounts which have reached us of this affair are really horrible. There are three women at present confined in our County Gaol, charged on the verdict of the Coroner's Jury, with _"Wilful Murder."_ Their names are Anne Roche, Honora Leahy, and Mary Clifford. *Honora Leahy* was the grandmother of the unfortunate deceased child, who, it is said, fell a sacrifice and murderous ignorance and superstition, and she has, for some years past, been the sole support that poor boy, and some other children of a deceased daughter, who were left quite destitute. We have heard it said that Honora Leahy, heretofore, always maintained good character; —so much has not been said for *Nance Roche*, who is described as superannuated, and having, *of necessity*, retired from the hustle and frail vanities of this wicked world, now claims a mysterious intimacy with certain *busy things, respectfully* denominated, *Good People* —hints at her profound knowledge and powerful influence on their supernatural agency, and is deeply skilled in every *Fairy Herb and Nostrum*. The wretched cripple was her patient, and she stands charged with effectually curing him of all the evils of this life. Mary Clifford who was the servant maid of Honora Leahy—has, as she asserts been impelled by conscientious visitings of remorse, to become an approver, and has accused her mistress and the *Doctress*  with Wilful murder. It is a tale of horror, disgusting and appalling to human reason.—The following was the verdict of the Coroner's Jury:—

"We find that the deceased, Michael Kelliher, came by his death in consequence of drowning in the River Monday, the 1th of June, 1826, by Nance Roche, and that Honora Leahy, the child's grandmother, and Mary Clifford, were accessary to the same."— *Tralee Herald.*

TRALEE ASSIZES

Child Murder — Superstition.

Ann Roche, an old woman of very advanced age, was indicted for the murder of Michael Leahy, a young child, drowning him in the Flesk. This case, which at first assumed a serious aspect, from the meaning imputed to words spoken by the prisoner, "that the sin of the child's death was on the grand-mother, and not on the prisoner," turned out to be a homicide committed under the delusion of the grossest superstition. The child, though four years old, could neither stand, walk, nor speak —*it was thought to be Fairy-struck*— the grand-mother ordered the prisoner and one of the witnesses, Mary Clifford, to bathe the child every morning, in that pool of the river Flesk, where the boundaries of three farms met; they had so bathed it for three mornings running, and on the last morning the prisoner kept the child longer under the water than usual, when her companion (the witness, Mary Clifford) said to the prisoner, "how can you hope ever to see God after this?" to which the prisoner replied, "that the sin was on the grandmother and not on her." Upon cross-examination, the witness said it was not done with intent to kill the child, but to cure it— "to put the Fairy out of it."

Our distinguished countryman, Dr. Wilde, in one of his interesting chapters on Irish popular  superstitions, recently given to the public, mourns over the loss of our old fairy-lore which is certain to result from the removal of so large a portion of the population through famine, pestilence, and emigration, the natural consequences of the potato-blight.
