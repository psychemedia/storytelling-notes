# A Fairy Changeling?

If you ever see someone acting out of character, you might refer to them as "not being themselves". Or if someone is behaving in an extreme way or irrational way, someone might cry out "they must be out of their mind". And so it has always been. And if you lived in a small community where someone was misbehaving, they might need reigning in somehow; if they were misbehaving really badly, folk might feel they even needed punishing. But even then, there needed to be some way to bring the transgressor back into the fold. Some way of redeeming them, or reconciling them back with that community.

Back in old Ireland, it was common to hear that someone was "away with the fairies" if they were acting a bit odd. Strokes were "fairy strokes". And changelings... well, changelings changed everything: a changeling, a fairy changeling, was a fairy swapped for a real person: a baby, an adult, they looked identical, or almost: there might be a sign, one leg shorter than the other, for example; and they didn't like certain things: iron, fire. The changeling explained a lot. If someone was behaving badly? Well: perhaps it wasn't them; a changeling could provide an explanation for why something wasn't "your fault": a sickly or disabled child might be a changeling, for example; and if you mistreated that child for behaving badly: well, perhaps that was to get the fairy out of them. (There was a counter to that: if you mistreated the changeling, then the fairies in the other world would similarly mistreat the person who had been replaced by the changeling.) So: fairies explained a lot.


though in other cases the fairies might harm you if you crossed them or wronged them in some way

And so it was as it is today: people who are different in some way are often treated as somehow alien. And those differences, well, maybe those differences were because the person was a changeling.

Back in old Ireland, as in old England, and in old Wales, and in old Scotland, people kept chickens. Some women, hen-wives, would keep a small flock of chickens and regularly sell eggs around the neighbourhood. Such a trade could bring the woman of the house an even greater income than her labourer husband earned. Bridget Cleary, a dressmaker by trade, a good profession — she even had her own sewing machine — supplemented her income in just such a way, selling eggs around the way; and with her husband, Michael, a cooper, a barrelmaker, they were comfortably off. And didn't she know it, with her ??hat/ribbon??

They were a bit odd, that couple. When they were just married, he had regularly spent time away from home; "working" he said, but folk knew what men away from home for nights on end got up to. And she, well, she was so friendly with the landlord's man (and they'd perhaps spit at the mention of him). There was something not right about that set up, somehow. And how long had they been married, with no children to show for it. She was eighteen when they wed, and what was she now? Twenty-five? Twenty-six, even?

Bridget and Michael lived in a small labourer's cottage, along with Bridget's father, Patrick (Bolland).

Or how about start from:

In 189??, following a court case in, ?? was sentenced to 20 years for murdering his wife. The charge had been that ...


So what was it about the case that caused Edward Clodd, President of the Folk-Lore society, to write to the Editor of the London *Daily Chronicle*, suggesting that a more lenient sentence should have been applied?
