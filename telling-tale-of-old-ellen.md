# The Tale of Old Ellen

Here's the story as I first imagined telling it, based on my reading, and forgetting, of various news reports from the early nineteen hundreds.


Old man Markey, now in his seventies, lived in a farm cottage with his wife, at May Hill, near the Forest of Dean; his daughter and his granddaughter, both of them married, lived nearby. He'd been complaining recently about having lost his watch, his *gold* watch, but the rest of the family were of the mind that he had started losing something else.

One Saturday, Markey and his wife sent off into town; they locked the front door from the inside, the backdoor from the outside, and were gone for much of day. It was dark when they got back, and after taking a little supper, were soon in bed.

In the light of the next morning, they realised they had been robbed: the chest of drawers had been forced open with a hammer, and their savings, £34 in gold and a pound in silver, a considerable sum for a family such as theirs at the time, was missing.

They were quick to cast the blame — one of their neighbours, they'd always been jealous, it was surely them: a search was made of their house, but nothing seemed out of the ordinary.

And for old Mr Markey, well, he took it badly; he worried, he fretted, and he started to make himself ill.

Times were then, as times are now — it wasn't easy to get to see a doctor. The local paper may have had an advert for a miracle cure for backache kidney pills, but for the likes of Mr Markey, Ellen Hayward, Old Ellen, the *wise* woman, the *cunning* woman, the herbalist of Cinderford, would know what to suggest.

And so, after ten days or so worrying himself sick, took himself off to see Old Ellen. She knew what he was there for, of course, she always did. Whether she liked her customers or not, it made little difference to Old Ellen. She made him a cup of tea; gave him some herbs for his pains, and took nothing in return; and as for the other matter: well, the best thing would be to wait for nine days or; whoever had taken then gold would see how it had ailed him, and they'd surely get it back to him; or leave it where he could find it. Because that was how the old magic worked. When it was known that the cunning man or woman had been consulted... well, things could happen as a result.

And the word soon got out.

It took less than a day.

For on the very next morning, old Mr Markey heard sounds of screaming from one of the neighbouring houses; sounds of crokery being smashed, sounds of windows being broken, sounds of... sounds of his daughter, and his grand-daughter, shrieking, and wailing, and overcome by madness. So violent was their frenzy they had to be separated; so intense their madness, the grand-daughter had to be taken to Newent Workhouse hosptial, the daughter to Gloucester asylum.

The mutterings started.

Old Ellen, they said, old Ellen had cast a charm, had looked into a crystal and shown Markey the face of a family member as the thief. And they left the rest unsaid.

It would have been a sleepless night for Markey and hist wife. Early the next morning, between seven and eight o'clock, Mrs markey left the house. Nothing strange in that, you might think, but she didn't take a hat, didn't take a coat, didn't take anything.

When her son George arrived later that morning, from Blakeney, several miles away, with some brandy for his mother, considerate man that he was, she still hadn't returned.

And as the afternoon drew on, still no sign of her. They search began, through the fields, the woodland, by the ponds... but there was no sign of her.

All day Saturday they searched. But it was as if she had vanished from the face of the earth completely.

George became increasingly upset, made his way back to Blakeney, but could not rest there, and returned early Sunday. Police Inspector Dennis, from Gloucester, arrived to lead the search. But without success. George's condition worsened all through that afternoon. 

And Sunday turned into Monday...

Mr Markey, racked by rheumatism, had taken to his bed. His son George was now consumed by madness; he smashed up a sofa, and it took three of the strongest men in the village to restrain him.

As the afternoon drew to a close, a figure appeared. Coming from the direction of Newent wood, came old Mrs Markey, a hazel stick in her hand, "to keep the witches away, to keep the witches away" she'd tell anyone who came near her; she'd been living on leaves and ditch-water, had heard various members of her family, and others, searching for her, but had been to scared to show herself, lest she reveal herself to the witches.

But George was still not himself. After a couple of of days, his two brother's managed to get him back home to Blakeney, but for his young wife, and her mother, who lived with them, they both became upset and didn't feel safe. They started to make arrangements to spend the night elsewhere, and George became frenzied again. He tried to pass witchwood into their hands "take this, take this, oh, you must take this; and pray, pray to keep them away, keep the witches away". George, his frenzy now violent, nearly took his eye out on an iron spike, stumbled out into the road, hatless, bootless, his face bleeding. A collier took him in, but not before a runner was sent to the police constable, who was quick to return, to arrest George Markey as a suspected wandering lunatic just before midnight. He spent the rest of the night in the cell, ranting and wailing about the witches; and nearly half-dead from the damage to his eye, was taken next morning to Newnham, for a medical inspection, where he was at once pronounced insane.

As you might imagine, the story had become something of a news item. The local, regional and even national press had been following the story for several days, one of them even commenting how "her trade may be expected to suffer a decline". Even Old Ellen herself felt obliged to respond, asking the *Gloucester Citizen* to publish a communication in which she described herself as herbalist with a many years successful practice, and a good reputation thoughout country; she denied in the strongest terms that she was a witch or a fortune teller, or had any powers that allowed her to bewitch anyone else. She also made an appeal, that the cruel attacks made on her through the press had prevented her from earning her living, and that even the smallest subscription in her support should would be most thankfully received.
