St. Dunstan.— Was it at Glastonbury or at Mayfield that this saint "pulled the Devil by the nose".

https://archive.org/details/notesandqueries39haylgoog/page/216/mode/2up?q=devil+Dunstan+folktale+Osbern

St. Dunstan (10^'' S. i. U9).-Walter Gale, the Sussex schoolmaster, records that in 1740 "there was at Mayfield a pair of tongs, which the inhabitants affirmed, and many believed, to be that with which St. Dunstan, Archbishop of Canterbury, who had his residence at a tine ancient dome in this town, pinched the devil by the nose when, in the form of a handsome maid, he tempted him." See Chambers's 'Book of Days' (1864), vol. i. P- 331. A. R. Baylky.

It was at Mayfield that the devil is supposed to ha vo had his nose pulled by St. Dunstan. Eadmer, in his 'Life of St. Dunstan,' who died in 988, seems to imply that the palace of the Archbishops of Canterbury at Mayfield was built by that prelate, who, ho says, erected a wooden church. The life of this saint, as related by Osbern, Eadmer, and other monkish writers, is filled with accounts of miracles wrought by him, and also of bickerings and conflicts with the devil, in all which Satan met with more than his match. We are told that the archbishop, performing in person the ceremony of dedicating Mayfield Church, and, according to the accustomed form, going in procession round the building, observed that it was out of the line of sanctity, or, in other words, that it did not stand due east or west; on which he gently touched the edifice with his shoulder, and moved it into its proper bearings, to the great amazement and edification of ail tho spectators.

In connexion with Glastonbury there wag a hundred years ago at the west end of tho Tor, or tho Tower of St. Michael, a carved figure of the archangel, holding in tiis IimmMs a pair of scales, in one of which v, f,

and in the other a devil, who was n ! ly

another bearing upon the scales ; both were represented, however, as much too light to poise against the holy volume.

The story of St. Dunstan seizing the devil bv the nose occurs for the first time in Osbern's 'Life' of the "father of monks," where it is, I think, mentioned in connexion with his life in his cell at Glastonbury. The story is not quite so ridiculous as it appears at first sight. Dustan's dreams and "fairy tales" were generally turned to proJituhfe account for the edification of children, rather than of "grown-ups," and it is thought possible that the saint actually did t^ke some ribald intruder into his coll 03' the nose with some implement like the tongs, See the Rev. Wra. Stubljs's 'Memorials of Saint Dunstan,' Inlrod., p. Ixv and note.

The tongs are at Mayfield, and that should suffice, C. S. Waud.

St. Augustine's at Canterbury, I have always heard, claims the site of the tug.

*St Dunstan.* — Walter Gale, the Sussex schoolmaster, records that in 1749, 'there was at Mayfield a pair of tongs, which the inhabitants affirmed, and many believed, to be that with which St Dunstan, Archbishop of Canterbury, who had its residence at a fine ancient dome in this town, pinched the devil by the nose when, in the form of a handsome maid, he tempted him.' What made it more terrible to this sightly tempter was, that the tongs happened to be red-hot, the pair being one that St Dunstan made use of at his forge, for it seems that the Archbishop was a blacksmith as well as a saint.

`[TH: As told in Poetic Edda]`

There was a king in Sweden named Niduth; he had two sons, and a daughter named Baudvilde. At the same time existed three brothers, sons of an Alf-king,® that is to say, of supernatural race. They were named Slagfid, Egill, and Voelund. Pursuing the chase, and skating, they arrived in the Valley of Ulfdal, or the Valley of Bears, and constructed themselves a habitation on the borders of a lake.

There, one morning, they found three Valkylies, `[The Valkyries, in the Scandinavian mythology, have almost the same attributes as the parcae in the mythology of Greece. They also spin the thread of destiny, and besides, they assist at combats, by which, among a barbarous people, destinies are regulated. Although three are generally admitted, it appears, nevertheless, that others were also supposed to exist; and it is singular that daughters of earth might be Valkyries. We have here an example. Their fathers are named, who, a thing sufficiently odd, have frankish names; one is called Loedver, i. e., Lonis, and the other Kiare, probably Charles, of whom they make a king of Valland, a term under which was solely understood the country of the Walloons, France and Italy. See Depping Hist, des Expéditions maritime des Normands. Paris, 1826. 8vo. tom. ii. p. 388. The Valkyries appeared in the day in the form of swans; they could put off this form, which, according to the rude notions of the Scandinavians, was but a robe with which they covered themselves, and then they appeared in the human form. It is, therefore, here said, they had near them their swan robes. One of them was named Swan-hvite, or white as a swan.]` who, having put off their swan robes, were spinning flax: it was Alvite, [Allwite], or all-knowing; Svanhvite, or white as a swan; both of them daughters of King Loedver; and Alrune, daughter of Kiar, King of Valland. The brothers carried them to their dwelling, and were united to them; Slagfid took Swanwhite, Egill Alrune, and Voelund took Allwite.

After having lived with their husbands seven winters, the Valkyries flew away to visit the battles; two of the brothers, Egill and Slagfid, took their skates and went in search of their wives; but Voelund remained in his dwelling in the expectation of his wife's return, and applied himself to goldsmith's work.

The king Niduth, having heard mention of the beautiful works in gold that he fabricated, was desirous of possessing himself of them. He one night surreptitiously visits the dwelling of Voelund, accompanied by his warriors; they find there seven hundred rings strung on a strip of bark, and carry off one in the absence of the owner. At length he returns from the chase, lights a fire, and prepares for his repast some of the flesh of a bear he had killed, lays himself down on another bear's skin, and counts leisurely over his rings; he perceives with affright that one is missing. Nevertheless he falls asleep: during his slumber, the marauders bind him; Niduth presents himself when Voelund awakes, and carries him off to his dwelling after having seized upon the beautiful sword that the Smith had forged for himself. He gives the ring which he had purloined to his daughter. The queen, seeing the captive, does not like his look, is afraid of him, and orders him to be hamstrung, and retained as a prisoner. In consequence, Voelund, after being thus maimed, is shut up in a small island, and forced to fabricate all sorts of jewels for the king.

Voelund seeks an opportunity to revenge himself. Notwithstanding, he does not cease to work for his master. The two sons of Niduth sometimes come to see him, and ask for the keys of the coffer in which he has deposited his jewels. There they see the superb collars of gold of his workmanship. The king having interdicted every one from having access to the artisan, Voelund desires the two princes not to reveal to any one that they have been in his workshop, and he promises to give them some of his beautiful works if they will come to him again clandestinely on the morrow.

They take care not to fail. When they arrive, Voelund cuts off their heads, and buries their bodies in a swamp before his dwelling. He fashions their skulls into cups, mounts them in silver, and sends them to the king. Their eye-balls he enchases in the same precious metal, as breast ornaments, and sends them to the queen; turns their teeth into the form of pearls, and makes a necklace of them, which he sends to their sister Baudvilde. She had broken the ring which the king had carried off from Voelund, and which the goldsmith had intended for his wife, and she now sends a messenger to the artisan requesting him to repair the jewel unknown to her father. Voelund insists upon her bringing it herself under pretext of the king's injunction that he should work for no one but himself. She comes; Voelund gives her a soporific potion, and afterwards ravishes her. Then triumphing that he had achieved his revenge, he thinks of escaping. In fact, he flies, leaving Baudvilde in tears on account of his departure, and in dread of her father's anger. Voelund seats himself upon the fence which encloses the king's habitation. The queen incites the king to speak to him. Niduth deplores the loss of his sons, and repents having followed the counsels of the queen in maiming Voelund, who addresses himself to the king, and makes him swear that he will not punish his daughter for being pregnant. He reveals to him how he will find in his workshop the forge-bellows stained with the blood of his sons, and coldly recounts to him that their skulls, fashioned into vases, ornament the royal table.

Niduth is in desperation at what he hears; and desolate at not being able to reach the author of these misdeeds. Voelund flies away laughing, leaving the king plunged in grief. Having called his daughter, Niduth receives confirmation of the truth of that which the terrible smith had revealed to him. Baudvilde, in tears, confesses her shame, and it is by her lamentations that the chant of the Edda closes.

In this chant no mention is made of the son of Baudvilde by Voelund, nor of the sword Mimung, which his father forged for him, as we shall presently see. Nevertheless, the Edda of Snorro makes mention of this word which the old skalds had used to designate a sword, and which proves that the rest of the romance was current in the most antient times in the north.


`[TH: Wilkina Saga has a parallel tale with bits we might co-opt (and which Story Crow seems to have adopted in his telling)]`

pp. xxii-xxv

In the meanwhile, Egil, Voelund's brother, came to the king's court; he was the most skilful archer of his time. The king commanded Egil to shoot at, and pierce with an arrow, an apple placed on the head of EgiFs own child. He took two arrows struck the apple with one of them, and said that with the other he would have pierced the king if he had had the misfortune to kill his child.

Some time afterward it happened that the king's daughter broke a precious ring; she sent to Voeland requesting him to repair it without the knowledge of her father. Voelund replied that he could not do any work without the king's permission. He insisted that she should come herself. The princess repaired to the forge, and when she had entered, Voelund fastened the door, and violated her person. In the course of time she gave birth to a son.

A short time after this two sons of the king addressed themselves to Voelund in order that he might make them some arrows. He repeated to them that he could work for no one but the king, but he induced them to come again to him, walking backwards, which they did. When they had entered, he again fastened the door of the forge, killed the two princes, and buried their bodies. When, on the morrow, enquiry was made whether the two princes had not been at his dwelling, he answered, that they had come, but that they had gone away to hunt in the forest, and he shewed the print of their footsteps in the snow. He then took their skulls, made drinking cups of them, fashioned their bones into salt-cellars and other vases, mounting them artistically in gold and silver, and gave the whole to the king, who, not having any suspicion, was proud of such beautiful ornaments for his table at his feasts.

Voelund, the smith, had thus revenged himself of the despite with which he had been treated; he had deprived the king of his sons, he had caused him to drink out of their sculls, and, besides, the daughter of Nidung was pregnant by him.

He could not doubt that the king would put him to death if he became acquainted with these facts. He requested his brother, therefore, to furnish him with feathers of all sizes. Egil went into the woods, killed all sorts of birds, and brought the feathers to Voelund. With them Voelund made himself wings resembling those of a great bird of prey. The brothers met together in the forge, Voelund gave the wings to Egil, and requested him to take them with him to the mountain, to attach them to himself, and to try to fly. Egil enquired how he must proceed to raise hifiiself in the air, and to re-descend to the earth when he desired to do so. Voelund replied, that he must spread the wings, and direct himself against the wind, and that then he would fly like the swiftest bird. When Egil essayed to do so, he fell, and narrowly escaped breaking hb neck; he returned to his brother, and when he was asked whether the wings were good, he answered: "If it was as easy to descend with your wings as to fly with them, I should have passed into another country, and yoa would have never seen them again."

Voelund said he would correct this defect; he then requested Egil to tell the king's daughter to come to him, which his brother accordingly did. When she came to the forge they conversed together a long time. Voelund communicated to her the resolution he had taken, he predicted that she would give birth to a son; he exhorted her to bring him up with care, and when he was old enough to bear arms, to tell him to go in quest of the arms which his father had prepared for him.

Before they separated, they mutually promised each other upon oath not to have any other husband or wife. It is related that Voelund then ascended to the roof of his house, took the wings, prepared himself, and at last ascended into the air. He said to his brother: "If you are called upon to shoot at me, you will aim at this bladder which I have filled with the blood of the sons of King Nidung, and which I have fastened under my left arm. When flying away he confessed to his brother that he had misdirected him in the mode of managing the wings, because he was suspicious of him.

Voelund flew up on the highest tower, and cried out with all his might for the king to come and speak with him. On hearing his voice the king came out, and said, "Voelund, have you become a bird? What is your project?" — "My lord," replied the smith, "I am at present bird and man at once; I depart, and you will never see me again in your life. Nevertheless, before I go, I will reveal to you some secrets. You cut my ham-strings to prevent me from going, and I revenged myself upon your daughter, who is with child by me. You would have deprived me of the use of my feet, and, in my turn, I have deprived you of your sons, whose throats I cut with my own hand; but you will find their bones in the vases garnished with gold and silver with which I have ornamented your table." Having said these words Voelund disappeared in the air. Then the king said to Egil: "Take your bow, and shoot ai him, the villain must not escape alive; if you miss him your head shall pay the forfeit." Egil took his bow, shot, and the arrow struck Voelund under the left arm, so that the blood descended upon the earth. "It is good," said the king, "Voelund cannot go far." Nevertheless he flew into Seeland, descended in a wood, where he constructed himself a dwelling.

In a vale in Berkshire, at the foot of White Horse Hill, and in the midst of a heap of rude stones fixed in the earth, according to tradition, formerly dwelt a person called Wayland Smith; no one ever saw him, but when his services were required to shoe a horse, it sufficed to leave the horse among the stones, and to place on one of the stones a piece of money. When a reasonable time had elapsed the horse was found to be shod and the piece of money gone. The reader need not be reminded of the use Sir Walter Scott has made of the tradition in the Wayland Smith of his Kenilworth.

The rude stones which were scattered over the Vale of White Horse, had been erected by the hand of man. They were such Druidic monuments as were found in many places of Great Britain and France, and which disappear gradually as agriculture advances. Documents are wanting which might inform us how the Scandinavian legend of Weland came to be attached to this locality.

NOTES ON SOME BLACKSMITHS'
LEGENDS AND THE OBSERVANCE
OF ST. CLEMENT'S DAY.
BY GORDON P. G. HILLS.

Hampshire Field Club

includes:

"And it came to pass when Solomon, the son of David, had finished the temple of Jerusalem, that he called unto him the
chief architects, the head architects, the head artificers, and cunning workers in silver and gold, in wood and ivory, and in stone, yea, all who had aided in rearing the temple of the Lord and he said unto them: 'Sit ye down at my table. I have prepared a feast for all chief workers and cunning artificers; stretch forth your hands, therefore, and eat, and drink, and be merry. Is not the labourer worthy of his hire? Is not the skilful artificer worthy of his honour ? Muzzle not the ox that treadeth out the corn.' And when Solomon and the chief workers were seated, and the fatness of the land, and the wine and the oil thereof, were set upon the table, there came one who knocked loudly at the door and thrust himself into the festal chamber. Then Solomon the King was wroth. And the stranger said: 'When men wish to honour me they call me the Son of the Forge, but when they desire to mock me they call me the blacksmith, and, seeing that the toil of working in the fire covers me with sweat and smut, the latter name, O King, is not inapt, and in that thy servant desires no better.' 'But,' said Solomon, 'why come you thus rudely and unbidden to the feast where none but the chief workers of the temple are invited?' 'Please you, my Lord, I came rudely,' replied the man, 'because your servants obliged me to force my
way; but I came not unbidden. Was it not proclaimed that the chief workmen of the temple were invited to dine with the King
of Israel?' Then he who carved the cherubim said: 'This fellow is no sculptor,' and he who inlaid the roof with pure gold said: 'Neither is he a worker in fine metals,' and he who raised walls said: 'He is no cutter in stone,' and he who made the roof cried out: 'He is not cunning in cedar wood, neither knoweth he the mystery of knitting strange pieces of timber together.' Then said Solomon: 'What hast thou to say, Son of the Forge, why I should not order thee to be plucked by the beard, scourged with the scourge, and stoned to death with stones?' . And when the Son of the Forge heard this he was in no sort dismayed, but, advancing to the table, snatched up and swallowed a glass of wine, and said: 'O King, live for ever. The chief men of the workers in wood and gold and stone have said that I am not of them, and they said truly. I am their superior. Before they lived I was created. I am their master, and they are all my servants.' And he turned him round and said to the chief carver in stone: 'Who made the tools with which you carve?' And he said: 'The blacksmith.' And he said to the chief mason: 'Who made the chisel with which the stones of the temple were squared?' "And he said: 'The blacksmith.' And he said to the chief worker in wood: 'Who made the tools with which you felled the trees of Lebanon and made into the pillars and roof of the temple?' And he answered: 'The blacksmith;' 'Enough, enough, good fellow,' said Solomon; 'Thou hast proved that I invited thee, and thou art all men's father. Go and wash the smut of the forge from thy face, and come and sit at my right hand. The chief of workmen are but men; thou art more.' So it happened that the feast of Solomon and the blacksmith has been honoured ever since."

TO DO

THE Tinker of Tamlacht

SEUMAS MACMANUS

THE Tinker of Tamlacht was a lad, long, long ago, who used to make and fix stills. And there was one day he was going across a soft bog to a place where he had to fix a still, and he was sinking over his head in it every other step he took, and the temper got the better of the poor man, and at last says he: "May the Devil take me if I come this way again." iTowsemever??, he got out of the bog all right at length, and he fixed his still, and he got three shillings for the job.

On his way back, he met a poor man, who told him he was in great distress and asked him for help; and the Tinker put his hand in his pocket and reached him one of the three shillings. He hadn't gone half a mile farther on when another poor man appears before him, and had another great story of distress entirely for him, and asked the Tinker for help. Now the Tinker, for he was a good-natured soul, put his hand in his pocket and reached him another of the shillings, and then he trudged on again; and what would you have of it but afor he covered another half mile of the ground a third poor man appears before him, with a tale of distress, too, and a pitiful face, and begged for help.

"Well," says the Tinker, says he, "I have just one shillin' in my pocket, and I have a wife and children in want at home, and I'll divide the shillin' with you."

But says the poor man, says he: "Don't break on it, for God's sake, for anything less than a shillin' would be of little use to me."

Without any more ado, into his pocket the Tinker quickly thrusts his hand, and reaches out his third and last shilling and the last ha'penny he bad in the world to the poor man, and the minute he did this says the poor man till him, says he: "I am an angel from heaven who just came to try you, and appeared before you as three, different, poor men; and now, in reward for the kindly heart you have toward the poor, I will grant you any three requests you like to ask."

The Tinker, he thanked him right heartily; and then he thought what three requests he should ask of him. Wherever he went it was always a trouble to him that people were stealing things out of his budget, so he thought it would be a grand thing, entirely, if he could remedy it once and for all. And, as a first request, he asked that anything he would put into his pudget might never came out again till he would take it out himself.

The Angel said that was granted, and asked him what was his second request. And, after he had thought over in his mind for a while, says the Tinker, says he: "I have one apple-bush growin' in my garden, and I never can get any good of it, for the blackguards of Tamlacht always steal every apple off it, and I would ask it as a request that any one who leaves a hand on them apples may stick to the apple and to the bush till I release them myself."

"That's granted, too," said the Angel. "What is your third request?"

"Well, as we're both poor and bothered at home," says the Tinker, "and our mealchest's low, I ask, as a request, that it may be filled and will be never empty more."

"That's granted, too," says the Angel, "and it's sorry I am for you that you didn't ask, as your first and greatest request, to have God's blessing."

Says the Tinker, says he: "True enough, God's blessin' would be a fine request to ask; but, if I had it itself, would it thicken our stirabout for us? Would it break the bones of Tamlacht blackguards for me when they'd go stealin' off my wee apple-tree and puttin' their hands in my budget?"

The Angel, he shook his head; and he went away.

Now, in ten days' time, he was going to fix another still, and he was going over the selfsame road and through the same bog, sinking over his head every step he took; and, when he was right in the middle of it, the Devil come to him and reminded him of his prayer that he might take him if he ever went that way again.

"And now," says the Devil, "I have come for my due."

There was no way out of it, but to start away with the Devil, and the two of them started off on their journey. And, when they were coming near a town, says the Tinker to the Devil: "I'll be all ashamed, passin' through this town where everybody knows me, and them seein' you with me."

"Well," says the Devil, says he, "if you can contrive any way of hidin' me, I am willin' to be obligin'."

"T can that," says the Tinker, says he. "TIf you only put yourself into the smallest bulk; and, I suppose," says he, "a bit of lead is the smallest you can put yourself into. And then I will put you in my budget, and, as I go through the town, no one will be any the wiser."

The Devil (for, to give him his dues, he was obliging) turned himself into a bit of lead at once, and the Tinker put him in his budget, and then he hoisted the budget on his back and started off.

In the middle of the town there was a blacksmith's forge, and into the blacksmith's forge the Tinker went, and left down the budget on the anvil.

There were six, big, strong fellows standing around, and the Tinker asked every one of them to take a sledge. "For," says he, "as I came along the road I found somethin' movin' in my budget, and I believe it's nothin' good. So the six of ye hammer at this budget for dear life till ye's kill it, whatever it is."

Every one of the six took a sledge, and the Devil he began to roar inside the budget, but out he couldn't get without the Tinker's liberty.

The six fellows began to lay on the budget with all the nerves of their heart; and, every time the sledge-hammer came down on him, the Devil gave a yell. And the louder he yelled the louder they hammered.

The whole town was alarmed by the Devil's screeching; and, at length and at last, when there was nothing else for it, up the Devil flies, budget and all, and carried away the roof with him in a flame of fire and disappeared.

It was not long till the Tinker's wife had a young son, and she told him to go out and look for a sponsor for it.

The first man he met was the landlord, and he asked the Tinker where he was going.

"Lookin' for a sponsor for my child," says the Tinker.

"Will you take me as a sponsor?" says the landlord.

"I will not," says the Tinker 'for you are a sorry man. You've smiles for them that are rich, and nothin' but growls for them that are poor." And he passed on.

And the next he met was God, and he asked the Tinker to take him as a sponsor.

"Tll not have you," says the Tinker, "because you let stingy Bodach MacPartlan grow richer every day, while the poor Widow Managhan, who is helpless, is let grow poorer every day."

And then he went on, and the next he met was Death, and Death asked him: "*Will*you take me as sponsor?"

"Yes," says the Tinker, says he, "I'll take you; for you're the only fair and just man, and have no more respect for the rich than you have for the poor."

And he took Death home with him. And Death stood sponsor for his child.

**And now," says Death to the Tinker, "since you favored me as you have done, and since you don't seem to have a very good way on you, I would like to put you in a good way to rear up my godson. So," says he, "here's a little bottle that will never be empty. Take it; and wherever you find any one sick, high or low, this bottle will cure them, provided," says he, "that it isn't their last sickness."

"And how," says the Tinker, says he, 'tam I to know?"

'""T'll tell you that," says Death. "When you're brought into a sick-room you will always see me standing either at the head or the foot of the bed. If Iam standing at the bed-foot, you are at liberty to use the bottle and cure the patient, but if you see me standing at the bed-head, then you are not to interfere at your peril; for I have come for that sick man."

The Tinker agreed to this, and thanked him right heartily. And then, all at once, he set up for a doctor.

Wherever there was any one sick, the Tinker of Tamlacht went; and three drop from his bottle cured them, if they were to be cured.

The fame of him spread far and near very fast, and he was soon known and sent for all over Ireland, England, Scotland and France.

Now the King of Spain, he took bad; and, when all his doctors tried their hand on him, and gave him up, he heard tell of the Tinker of Tamlacht, that cured all men that he ever gave drink out of his bottle to, and he sent his ship to Ireland for him, and brought him over.

And, when the Tinker went into the King's bedroom, there he saw Death standing at the bed-head.

He made a pretense, of course, of feeling the King's pulse and looking at his tongue, and then says he: "My good man, you may make your will. for you."

When the King heard this he-commanded that the Tinker should give him three drops out of the bottle that cured all men, but the Tinker refused to do it.

The King ordered his soldiers to take hold of him, and threatened to have him shot through the heart there and then if he didn't give him the drink out of the bottle and cure him.

The Tinker was in a quandary.

Then says he: "Let every one else be cleared out of the room except myself and the King and four strong men."

This was done, and then the Tinker ordered the four strong men to take hold of the bed, every one by a post, and to lift it right round, the foot where the head should be and the head where the foot should be. Then Death was standing at the King's feet. And the Tinker gave him the drink out of his bottle, and the King jumped up, alive and well again.

He loaded the Tinker down with gold, and the Tinker set out for home. But he hadn't gone far when he found a hand on his shoulder, and who do you think it was but Death; and, as you may suppose, Death was in a towering rage, entirely.

Says Death, says he: "Didn't I warn you, on your peril, not to try to cure any man that you saw me waiting for? You have broken your bargain, so come with me yourself, now."

"Very well and good," says the Tinker. "I'll do that. The only request I ask is hat we may go through Ireland, and I may take one look at my own wee cabin again."

Death, he granted him this; and, when they were going past his own cabin, says the Tinker, says he: "There's bonny apples on that bush of mine in my garden, and they're waterin' my teeth. If you would only pull me one of them, I'd be happy, and I'd never forget you for it."

Bad ag Death was, he was not disobliging; so into the garden to pull him an apple he goes. And, when he put his hand on the apple, his hand stuck to the apple, and the apple stuck to the tree, and, if he was pulling and tugging from that day to this day, free from it he couldn't get himself.

The Tinker, he never minded him; but he went in home, and he went about his business as usual.

He left Death sticking to the tree for forty years, and during all that time he had a free hand and cured everybody, and there was no one in the whole world dying.

And, after forty years, the Tinker was passing by the tree one day, and he looks at Death sticking to the tree, and says he to Death: "Is it there you are yet?"

"If you let me down," says Death, says he, "I will give you sparings for forty years."

The Tinker, he agreed; and he let Death go, and there was plenty dying after that.

At the end of the forty years, Death come to the Tinker and told him his time was up.

"Very well and good," says the Tinker, "I'm ready to go with you. Only, we'll go home till I bid good-by to my wife and children first."

Death agreed to this; and, when they got into the Tinker's house, Death told him to hurry up and not be long.

'Dll not be long," says the Tinker. There was a bit of a candle burning on the Tinker's table, and it was nearly burned out.

Says the Tinker: "I'll only ask till that candle burns out, and then I'll go with you."

Death said that was reasonable, and he would grant it.

And, when he said this, the Tinker blew out the candle, and says he: "You will have more than a week to wait.'

And he took the bit of candle away, and he buried it nineteen feet deep in a bog.

And then Death watched that bog for forty years more till the bog wore down to where the bit of candle was; and, when he got it, he burned it out and then set off for the Tinker, and said he would have to come with him now.

"I'm dct: ready and willin' to come now," says the Tinker, "but," says he, "as I'm only too afeard I haven't given much attention to my soul for the last hundred years or so, I would wish, if it's not too unreasonable, that you give me time to say three Pater and Aves to try and make my peace before I go with you."

'Well, it isn't unreasonable," says Death, "and I grant it with a heart and a half."

"Then," says the Tinker, "I'll never say a Pater and Ave more."

And Death, he went away in a rage; and no wonder! .

Then, for near a hundred of years, the Tinker of Tamlacht was going about doctoring and curing, and piling up houses and houses full of wealth. And there was one night he was driving home from curing a man, and, passing over a bridge, he heard a great moaning and groaning underneath.

"What's wrong with you, my poor man?" calls the Tinker. "I'm the Tinker of Tamlacht, and I'll soon cure you."

"But you can't cure me," says he, "for I died three hundred years ago. There was a penance laid on me, when I was alive, to say three Pater and Aves for my sins, and I died without doing my penance; and I never got rest, and I never will, till a kind Christian does my penance for me."

"Then I'll soon release you, poor soul," says the Tinker.

And down on his knees he got, there and then, and said them; and that minute Death jumped up, for it was Death was in it , and says he: "I have you at last!'!

And with him the poor Tinker had to go this time, sure enough. He brought him first up to heaven, and, when they came to the gates, St. Peter asked: "Who have you here?"

"The Tinker of Tamlacht," says Death, "and a long time I was waiting for him."

"He's the man," says Peter, "that wouldn't have God as sponsor for his child, so he will not come in here."

"Well and good," says Death. try elsewhere."

And the pair of them started off down to hell, and, as they knocked at the gates there, the Devil inquired who he had.

"The Tinker of Tamlacht," says Death.

"Take him away, take him away out of this!" says the Devil, says he, "for he'll not get in here. I got enough of that lad," says he, "and I'm sure I don't want any more of him; he'd make hell too hot."

"There you are," says Death, says he; "vou see your character's everywhere afore you. What am I to do with you?"

"Well," says the Tinker, "you took me away without me wishin' for it, and now you must provide for me."

Says Death: "I can't provide for you, and, since no one will take you off my hands, T can't be bothered with you any longer. What would you like yourself? I'll do what I can for you."

The Tinker thought, and says he: "I believe I'd like to be a young fellow again of eighteen, and back in the world roamin' it."

Death agreed. He made him a strapping, young fellow of eighteen and left him back in Ireland again. And, from that day to this, the Tinker of Tamlacht hasn't grown a day older than eighteen. And he's wandering Ireland 'round from end to wynd and from post to pillar wherever there is fun to be found.

He's at weddings and wakes and jolly christenings; and, if there's a fight in the fair, he's in the heart of it.

There's many's the man has met and chatted with the gay, young stranger in one end of Ireland or the other, and thought him brave company, and jolly; but it's seldom they suspect till long after that they have been chatting and drinking with the Tinker of Tamlacht.
