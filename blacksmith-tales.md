TO DO

THE Tinker of Tamlacht

SEUMAS MACMANUS

THE Tinker of Tamlacht was a lad, long, long ago, who used to make and fix stills. And there was one day he was going across a soft bog to a place where he had to fix a still, and he was sinking over his head in it every other step he took, and the temper got the better of the poor man, and at last says he: "May the Devil take me if I come this way again." iTowsemever??, he got out of the bog all right at length, and he fixed his still, and he got three shillings for the job.

On his way back, he met a poor man, who told him he was in great distress and asked him for help; and the Tinker put his hand in his pocket and reached him one of the three shillings. He hadn't gone half a mile farther on when another poor man appears before him, and had another great story of distress entirely for him, and asked the Tinker for help. Now the Tinker, for he was a good-natured soul, put his hand in his pocket and reached him another of the shillings, and then he trudged on again; and what would you have of it but afor he covered another half mile of the ground a third poor man appears before him, with a tale of distress, too, and a pitiful face, and begged for help.

"Well," says the Tinker, says he, "I have just one shillin' in my pocket, and I have a wife and children in want at home, and I'll divide the shillin' with you."

But says the poor man, says he: "Don't break on it, for God's sake, for anything less than a shillin' would be of little use to me."

Without any more ado, into his pocket the Tinker quickly thrusts his hand, and reaches out his third and last shilling and the last ha'penny he bad in the world to the poor man, and the minute he did this says the poor man till him, says he: "I am an angel from heaven who just came to try you, and appeared before you as three, different, poor men; and now, in reward for the kindly heart you have toward the poor, I will grant you any three requests you like to ask."

The Tinker, he thanked him right heartily; and then he thought what three requests he should ask of him. Wherever he went it was always a trouble to him that people were stealing things out of his budget, so he thought it would be a grand thing, entirely, if he could remedy it once and for all. And, as a first request, he asked that anything he would put into his pudget might never came out again till he would take it out himself.

The Angel said that was granted, and asked him what was his second request. And, after he had thought over in his mind for a while, says the Tinker, says he: "I have one apple-bush growin' in my garden, and I never can get any good of it, for the blackguards of Tamlacht always steal every apple off it, and I would ask it as a request that any one who leaves a hand on them apples may stick to the apple and to the bush till I release them myself."

"That's granted, too," said the Angel. "What is your third request?"

"Well, as we're both poor and bothered at home," says the Tinker, "and our mealchest's low, I ask, as a request, that it may be filled and will be never empty more."

"That's granted, too," says the Angel, "and it's sorry I am for you that you didn't ask, as your first and greatest request, to have God's blessing."

Says the Tinker, says he: "True enough, God's blessin' would be a fine request to ask; but, if I had it itself, would it thicken our stirabout for us? Would it break the bones of Tamlacht blackguards for me when they'd go stealin' off my wee apple-tree and puttin' their hands in my budget?"

The Angel, he shook his head; and he went away.

Now, in ten days' time, he was going to fix another still, and he was going over the selfsame road and through the same bog, sinking over his head every step he took; and, when he was right in the middle of it, the Devil come to him and reminded him of his prayer that he might take him if he ever went that way again.

"And now," says the Devil, "I have come for my due."

There was no way out of it, but to start away with the Devil, and the two of them started off on their journey. And, when they were coming near a town, says the Tinker to the Devil: "I'll be all ashamed, passin' through this town where everybody knows me, and them seein' you with me."

"Well," says the Devil, says he, "if you can contrive any way of hidin' me, I am willin' to be obligin'."

"T can that," says the Tinker, says he. "TIf you only put yourself into the smallest bulk; and, I suppose," says he, "a bit of lead is the smallest you can put yourself into. And then I will put you in my budget, and, as I go through the town, no one will be any the wiser."

The Devil (for, to give him his dues, he was obliging) turned himself into a bit of lead at once, and the Tinker put him in his budget, and then he hoisted the budget on his back and started off.

In the middle of the town there was a blacksmith's forge, and into the blacksmith's forge the Tinker went, and left down the budget on the anvil.

There were six, big, strong fellows standing around, and the Tinker asked every one of them to take a sledge. "For," says he, "as I came along the road I found somethin' movin' in my budget, and I believe it's nothin' good. So the six of ye hammer at this budget for dear life till ye's kill it, whatever it is."

Every one of the six took a sledge, and the Devil he began to roar inside the budget, but out he couldn't get without the Tinker's liberty.

The six fellows began to lay on the budget with all the nerves of their heart; and, every time the sledge-hammer came down on him, the Devil gave a yell. And the louder he yelled the louder they hammered.

The whole town was alarmed by the Devil's screeching; and, at length and at last, when there was nothing else for it, up the Devil flies, budget and all, and carried away the roof with him in a flame of fire and disappeared.

It was not long till the Tinker's wife had a young son, and she told him to go out and look for a sponsor for it.

The first man he met was the landlord, and he asked the Tinker where he was going.

"Lookin' for a sponsor for my child," says the Tinker.

'"*Will you take me as a sponsor?" says the landlord.

"T will not, " says the Tinker 'for you are a sorry man. You've smiles for them that are rich, and nothin' but growls for them that are poor." And he passed on.

And the next he met was God, and he asked the Tinker to take him as a sponsor.

"Tll not have you," says the Tinker, "because you let stingy Bodach MacPartlan grow richer every day, while the poor Widow Managhan, who is helpless, is let grow poorer every day."

And then he went on, and the next he met was Death, and Death asked him: "*Will*you take me as sponsor?"

"Yes," says the Tinker, says he, "I'll take you; for you're the only fair and just man, and have no more respect for the rich than you have for the poor."

And he took Death home with him. And Death stood sponsor for his child.

**And now," says Death to the Tinker, "since you favored me as you have done, and since you don't seem to have a very good way on you, I would like to put you in a good way to rear up my godson. So," says he, "here's a little bottle that will never be empty. Take it; and wherever you find any one sick, high or low, this bottle will cure them, provided," says he, "that it isn't their last sickness."

"And how," says the Tinker, says he, 'tam I to know?"

'""T'll tell you that," says Death. "When you're brought into a sick-room you will always see me standing either at the head or the foot of the bed. If Iam standing at the bed-foot, you are at liberty to use the bottle and cure the patient, but if you see me standing at the bed-head, then you are not to interfere at your peril; for I have come for that sick man."

The Tinker agreed to this, and thanked him right heartily. And then, all at once, he set up for a doctor.

Wherever there was any one sick, the Tinker of Tamlacht went; and three drop from his bottle cured them, if they were to be cured.

The fame of him spread far and near very fast, and he was soon known and sent for all over Ireland, England, Scotland and France.

Now the King of Spain, he took bad; and, when all his doctors tried their hand on him, and gave him up, he heard tell of the Tinker of Tamlacht, that cured all men that he ever gave drink out of his bottle to, and he sent his ship to Ireland for him, and brought him over.

And, when the Tinker went into the King's bedroom, there he saw Death standing at the bed-head.

He made a pretense, of course, of feeling the King's pulse and looking at his tongue, and then says he: "My good man, you may make your will. for you."

When the King heard this he-commanded that the Tinker should give him three drops out of the bottle that cured all men, but the Tinker refused to do it.

The King ordered his soldiers to take hold of him, and threatened to have him shot through the heart there and then if he didn't give him the drink out of the bottle and cure him.

The Tinker was in a quandary.

Then says he: "Let every one else be cleared out of the room except myself and the King and four strong men."

This was done, and then the Tinker ordered the four strong men to take hold of the bed, every one by a post, and to lift it right round, the foot where the head should be and the head where the foot should be. Then Death was standing at the King's feet. And the Tinker gave him the drink out of his bottle, and the King jumped up, alive and well again.

He loaded the Tinker down with gold, and the Tinker set out for home. But he hadn't gone far when he found a hand on his shoulder, and who do you think it was but Death; and, as you may suppose, Death was in a towering rage, entirely.

Says Death, says he: "Didn't I warn you, on your peril, not to try to cure any man that you saw me waiting for? You have broken your bargain, so come with me yourself, now."

"Very well and good," says the Tinker. "I'll do that. The only request I ask is hat we may go through Ireland, and I may take one look at my own wee cabin again."

Death, he granted him this; and, when they were going past his own cabin, says the Tinker, says he: "There's bonny apples on that bush of mine in my garden, and they're waterin' my teeth. If you would only pull me one of them, I'd be happy, and I'd never forget you for it."

Bad ag Death was, he was not disobliging; so into the garden to pull him an apple he goes. And, when he put his hand on the apple, his hand stuck to the apple, and the apple stuck to the tree, and, if he was pulling and tugging from that day to this day, free from it he couldn't get himself.

The Tinker, he never minded him; but he went in home, and he went about his business as usual.

He left Death sticking to the tree for forty years, and during all that time he had a free hand and cured everybody, and there was no one in the whole world dying.

And, after forty years, the Tinker was passing by the tree one day, and he looks at Death sticking to the tree, and says he to Death: "Is it there you are yet?"

"If you let me down," says Death, says he, "I will give you sparings for forty years."

The Tinker, he agreed; and he let Death go, and there was plenty dying after that.

At the end of the forty years, Death come to the Tinker and told him his time was up.

"Very well and good," says the Tinker, "I'm ready to go with you. Only, we'll go home till I bid good-by to my wife and children first."

Death agreed to this; and, when they got into the Tinker's house, Death told him to hurry up and not be long.

'Dll not be long," says the Tinker. There was a bit of a candle burning on the Tinker's table, and it was nearly burned out.

Says the Tinker: "I'll only ask till that candle burns out, and then I'll go with you."

Death said that was reasonable, and he would grant it.

And, when he said this, the Tinker blew out the candle, and says he: "You will have more than a week to wait.'

And he took the bit of candle away, and he buried it nineteen feet deep in a bog.

And then Death watched that bog for forty years more till the bog wore down to where the bit of candle was; and, when he got it, he burned it out and then set off for the Tinker, and said he would have to come with him now.

"I'm dct: ready and willin' to come now," says the Tinker, "but," says he, "as I'm only too afeard I haven't given much attention to my soul for the last hundred years or so, I would wish, if it's not too unreasonable, that you give me time to say three Pater and Aves to try and make my peace before I go with you."

'Well, it isn't unreasonable," says Death, "and I grant it with a heart and a half."

"Then," says the Tinker, "I'll never say a Pater and Ave more."

And Death, he went away in a rage; and no wonder! .

Then, for near a hundred of years, the Tinker of Tamlacht was going about doctoring and curing, and piling up houses and houses full of wealth. And there was one night he was driving home from curing a man, and, passing over a bridge, he heard a great moaning and groaning underneath.

"What's wrong with you, my poor man?" calls the Tinker. "I'm the Tinker of Tamlacht, and I'll soon cure you."

"But you can't cure me," says he, "for I died three hundred years ago. There was a penance laid on me, when I was alive, to say three Pater and Aves for my sins, and I died without doing my penance; and I never got rest, and I never will, till a kind Christian does my penance for me."

"Then I'll soon release you, poor soul," says the Tinker.

And down on his knees he got, there and then, and said them; and that minute Death jumped up, for it was Death was in it , and says he: "I have you at last!'!

And with him the poor Tinker had to go this time, sure enough. He brought him first up to heaven, and, when they came to the gates, St. Peter asked: "Who have you here?"

"The Tinker of Tamlacht," says Death, "and a long time I was waiting for him."

"He's the man," says Peter, "that wouldn't have God as sponsor for his child, so he will not come in here."

"Well and good," says Death. try elsewhere."

And the pair of them started off down to hell, and, as they knocked at the gates there, the Devil inquired who he had.

"The Tinker of Tamlacht," says Death.

"Take him away, take him away out of this!" says the Devil, says he, "for he'll not get in here. I got enough of that lad," says he, "and I'm sure I don't want any more of him; he'd make hell too hot."

"There you are," says Death, says he; "vou see your character's everywhere afore you. What am I to do with you?"

"Well," says the Tinker, "you took me away without me wishin' for it, and now you must provide for me."

Says Death: "I can't provide for you, and, since no one will take you off my hands, T can't be bothered with you any longer. What would you like yourself? I'll do what I can for you."

The Tinker thought, and says he: "I believe I'd like to be a young fellow again of eighteen, and back in the world roamin' it."

Death agreed. He made him a strapping, young fellow of eighteen and left him back in Ireland again. And, from that day to this, the Tinker of Tamlacht hasn't grown a day older than eighteen. And he's wandering Ireland 'round from end to wynd and from post to pillar wherever there is fun to be found.

He's at weddings and wakes and jolly christenings; and, if there's a fight in the fair, he's in the heart of it.

There's many's the man has met and chatted with the gay, young stranger in one end of Ireland or the other, and thought him brave company, and jolly; but it's seldom they suspect till long after that they have been chatting and drinking with the Tinker of Tamlacht.
