TO DO

A leading article in the Morning Herald of Tuesday last contains some remarks in reference to the late proceedings at Merthyr Tydvil, which, as they are calculated to excite unfounded prejudices against individuals, who really deserve well. of their country, we shall take the liberty to quote and comment upon. The article is as follows:— We are slow to believe the report that the bodies of the unfor- tunate men who have perished by the fire of the military at Merthyr Tydvil have been buried without the ceremony of a coroner's inquest. The duty of the coroner in such cases is so plainly marked out by the statute law of the land, and by invari- able practice, that if the remains of the persons shot by the "brave Highlanders" have been interred without such previous inquiry, it would be difficult to account for it on the ground of an ignorance of the law. The statute of the 4th Edward 1., de officio coronatoris, makes it imperative that when any person is ilain, or dies suddenly, or in prison, the coroner shall inquire concerning the manner of his death that he shall sit at the place where the death happened, super visum, corporis, and that the inquiry is to be made by a jury summoned from four, five, or six of the neighbouring towns, over whom he is to preside.— The strict exercise of this office of the coroner is necessary, not only to ascertain the cause and manner of the death of any of the King's subjects who have died under the circumstances afore- mentioned; but also to enable the coroner to certify whether any deodands or other forfeitures have been incurred for if any per- son be found guilty by the coroner's inquest of murder or homi- cide, the coroner is not only to issue his warrant to commit them to prison for final trial, but he is also to inquire concerning their lands, goods, and chattels, which are thereby forfeited. In some cases the deodand or forfeiture for homicide accrues to the crown, in others to the lord of the franchise and it is the duty of the coroner to certify the whole of his inquisition on those matters, together with the evidence, under his own seal and the seals of the jurors, to the Court of King's Bench, or to the next assizes. The'performance of those solemn duties is more essentially re- quisite in the case of the King's Subjects being put to death by the military than in any other, because nothing tends more to the subversion of a free state than the sanguinary exercise of military power, whatever may be the provocation. The mu nici- pal llawro in this country are particularly severe against rioters and disturbers of the peace, and therefore it is the less necessary to put down rioters by military execution. According to the excessively penal provisions of the riot act, all rioters continuing together for an hour after it has been read, render themselves liable to the pains and, penalties of felony. It then becomes a question whether all, or, at least, some of those persons, among whom, it is said, were several women, who were shot at Merthyr, might not have been apprehended and dealt with according to the civil laws, instead of being destroyed in promiscuous carnage by military execution? It should be kept in mind that the soldiers who fired on the crowd so long, and with so fatal an effect, were securely posted at the windows of an inn and though it might be true that the populace attempted to disarm JOlle of the soldiers who formed the guard outside the door, we have not heard of any attempt having been madte to take the inn itself by assault or storm, and to endanger the lives of the soldiers who occupied it as a fortress. If this dreadful catastrophe has been the result, as it is now stated, of an endeavour on the part of one or more of the iron masters to lower the rate of wages at the present time, it makes inquiry still more requisite. It is too bad that the lives of so many human beings, if that statement be true, should be sacrificed to the cupidity of any man, or set of men. There is no doubt that the soldiers acted according to orders, but the country ought to know who gave those orders, and under what circumstances they were given. We should like to see a list of the widows and orphans who have to deplore this dreadful transaction. If the magistrates, the masters, and the soldiery be free from blame, inquiry will exculpate them, and distinguish the innocent from the guilty. If, however, it should be true that the bodies have been interred without a coroner's in- quest, the coroner is responsible to the law, and the relatives and friends of the parties are not precluded from presenting bills of indictment for homicide, if they can undertake the expense of legal proceedings, to the grand jury at the ensuing assizes. The advantage of a coroner's inquisition is, that if a bill of indictment, preferred to a grand jury, be ignored, the accused party may still be arraigned and tried on the coroner's inquisition," which is the finding of the coroner's jury drawn up in form, and signed and sealed by the coroner and the jurors. It is particularly im- portant that the most solemn investigation, both in Courts of Justice and in the Hio-h Court of Parliament, should take place in such cases, lest military power should, in course of time, become too formidable to be consistent with the preservation of the liber- ties of a free state, or the people should become so familiar with scenes of blood as to rely more on the sanguinary exercise of their strength than upon the impartial dispensation of equal laws. We prejudge not this case, but public justice demands that it shall be thoroughly investigated. According to all the accounts that have been published of the late riots at Merthyr, there never was a case of civil bloodshed in which less of legal or parliamentary investi- gation was required. We are not prepared to state offi- cially why the proper officer omitted to hold an inquest on the unfortunate beings who fell in the affray, but we are informed the bodies were all taken away by the friends of the deceased and secretly interred in unconsecrated ground. To search for and dig up the bodies might have exasperated the people, and it was therefore a very proper exercise of discretion on the part of the coroner to let them remain quietly in, the graves to which they had been consigned. If the relatives of the deceased have any complaint to make let them ask for investigation, and we are quite sure it will be courted by all against whom even the shadow of an ac- cusation can be produced. We cannot but admire the ingenuity with which, for the purpose of shewing a little legal knowledge, and of patching up a fine piece of declamation, the Editor of the Morning Herald has garbled known facts, and supposed circum- stances which have not occurred. It is very easy for a well- educated Cockney gentleman, sitting tranquilly in an elbow chair over a bottle of old port, to work himself into an exstacy of enthusiasm on the subject of constitutional liberty to quell, with a flourish of his pen, the fury of an excited multitude to which he has never been exposed-and to descant in eloquent terms upon the sanguinary exercise of military power. If the writer of the article above quoted had paid but common attention to the accounts published in his own paper of the late occurrences at Merthyr, he would have seen that on the day preceding the fatal affray in which so many lives were lost, the Magistrates were unable to prevent the spoli- ation of Mr. Coffin's house, and the other acts of outrage then committed. Under these circumstances they were compelled to send for the military. About eighty of the 93d Highlanders arrive from Brecon on Friday morning, after a hasty march of eighteen miles-they proceed to the Castle Hotel, amidst the insults and vituperations of a mob comprising at least 10,000 men, emboldened by the success of their first attempts against the public peace, and deter- mined for further mischief. The Riot Act is read-the Magistrates, one after anothar, address the mob, and entreat them to disperse. What is the reply? An attack upon the soldiers in front of the inn-a seizure of their arms—and an actual attempt, by the populace, in which they nearly suc- ceed, to take the place by storm. At this moment, and not before, orders are given to lire. Could human forbearance go further? Were the soldiers to stand quietly at their posts, while their comrades were being murdered, until it should come to their turn to undergo the same fate ? By the law they would have been justified in firing on the refusal of the mob to disperse after the reading of the Riot Act. Surely self-defence—self-preservation, was an excuse which would be admitted before the judgment-seat of Heaven! The idea of two or three magistrates and half a dozen con- stables being able to apprehend such a body of rioters, consisting of men at whose herculean exertions of strength in their daily labour the comparatively effeminate Londoner would gape with astonishment, is perfectly ridiculous. Had they even apprehended a man or two, they would have been in the same situation as the Irish sentinel in Joe Miller, who exclaimed to his comrade-" Arrah, by J-s, honey, I've taken six prisoners." "Bring them along, then," says the other. Och, by my sowl, but they won't let me," cries the prisoner-taking Paddy. The insinuation of cupidity thrown out against the Iron Masters is altogether unmerited. Had some of them merely consulted their own interests, they would long since have put out the greater number of their furnaces and discharged more than half their men. The Merlin of the 22d January has the following paragraph, which we believe to be nearly true at the present moment:— A correspondent at Merthyr informs us that Mr. Crawshay and Mr. Guest are now keeping many hundred men in their em- ployment out of pure feelings of patriotism, inasmuch as large quantities of iron and coal are being daily stocked at their re- spective works without the prospect of a market for many months. Mr. Crawshay (adds our correspondent) has in stock, at his works in that neighbourhood, 70,000 tons of coal, and 20,000 tons of iron and it is said that the whole concern in which that gentleman is interested holds in hand at least 70,000 tons of iron -the make of nearly three years The loss of interest on the capital thus lying dead must be immense, and will absorb any little profit that might other- wise accrue from the sale of the article. It is not at all clear that the riot arose in consequence of the lowering of wages. Where positive information is defective, we must judge of the origin of events by their result. It appears that the chief object of popular vengeance was the Court of Re- qnests. We have not heard that the property of any Iron Master was either attacked or threatened. Why, then, is it to be covertly and basely pretended that their avarice has been the cause of destruction to their fellow-creatures ? If the wages have been reduced, we feel persuaded that it was an act of bitter necessity on the part of the Iron Masters, and that without such reduction they could not have afforded to carry on their works. It needs no argument to shew that, when any trade becomes greatly depressed, the work- man must either submit to a. diminution of wages, or lose his employment altogether. Let us hope for better times. With respect to the widows and orphans who have to de- plore this dreadful transaction, we are quite sure that they will not be made to suffer for the sins of their husbands and fathers. There is no place where the calls for public charity are more frequent than Merthyr; none where Charity is more readily and more munificently exercised.
