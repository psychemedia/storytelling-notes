<p>Whenever I try to find tales of the sea, I struggle somewhat. This is a perfect example of one of the ways I’ve ended distracting myself with when setting out to find sea stories: a quick pivot instead to look for a nautical account that might lead to a possible story, and then a descent down a rabbit hole / rat hole into something that is only loosely naval. In this case, historical reports relating to <em>The Press</em>, aka the press-gang (or pressgang ) and the practice of <em>impressment</em>.</p>
<p>Let’s start with an example of how appreciated the press-gang weren’t (other reports of similar reponses at other times and places are available!):</p>

Hampshire Chronicle - Monday 05 June 1815</p>
<p>About six o’clock on Wednesday evening, as the Officers of the Impress at Hull were attempting to take a seaman, by great exertion he extricated himself from their hold ; during the struggle a mob had collected together, and the press-gang were annoyed for a considerable time by them. After this, the mob assailed the house of rendezvous, the sign of the Spurn Lights, South-end; not satisfied with breaking all the windows and doors, and pulling down part of the front wall, they proceeded into the house, and destroyed all the furniture, linen, glass, &amp;c. the beds they tore open, and strewed the feathers the street; the liquors and ale they drank or carried away pitchers.</p>
</div>
<p>But it wasn’t just mobs that took up the cause of pressed men, as the following, rather unfortunate, incident, with black huoour potential,  in which a wife harries the press-gang for taking her husband, and with fatal result, dramatically shows,:</p>

<p class="admonition-title"><em>A dreadful affray</em>, May, 1803</p>

Hampshire Chronicle - Monday 16 May 1803</p>
<p>The impress on Saturday, both above and below Bridge, was the hottest that has been for some time—the boats belonging the ships at Deptford were particularly active, and it is supposed they obtained upwards of two hundred men, who were regulated on board the Enterprize till late at night, and sent in the different tenders to the Nore, to be put on board such ships whose crews are not completed.</p>
<p>The impressed men, for whom there was not room on board the Enterprize on Saturday were put into the Tower, and the gates shut, to prevent any of them effecting their escape.</p>
<p>The impress on the River was Sunday continued with the utmost activity.</p>
<p>On Saturday, about two o’clock, a dreadful affray happened at Hungerford-stairs, in consequence of a man of war’s boat, in which were a midshipman and a gang of seamen, impressing some watermen at that place. Having pressed several they put ashore to take another, when the wife of the last pressed man clung to her husband, and not being able to separate them, she was conveyed away with him in the boat; some coal heavers returning at this moment to work, immediately assailed the boat with glass bottles, and coals from the lighters, till most of the people within her were desperately wounded, and amongst the others, the unfortunate woman: the midshipman and three of his crew were beaten into the water and the whole had probably perished, had not a barge come at this moment belonging to one of the Insurance Offices, to demand the release of a pressed man belonging to that Office, then in the boat: recovering their man, and finding the situation of the press-gang, they took the boat in tow, and proceeded towards Blackfriar’s-bridge : to this place the mob pursued her, and being joined by additional numbers, they insisted upon sinking the boat with her crew but this was successfully resisted by the Master of the Insurance barge, who sailed with them below London-bridge, and put them singly on board their tender. The poor woman is said to have died of her wounds. Three of the gang were taken to an hospital with very little hopes of recovery.</p>
</div>
<p>At other times, members of the press-gang themselves found themselves subject to the law, as in the following report:</p>
<p>Other encounters with the law played out in different term, with even more comic potential. For example, here we have a case in in the press-gang impress a constable, and then a High Constable, before a personal acquaintance saved the day:</p>

<p class="admonition-title"><em>A very extraordinary outrage</em>, November, 1803</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000230/18031121/005/0003">https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000230/18031121/005/0003</a>
Hampshire Chronicle - Monday 21 November 1803</p>
<p>The following are the particulars of a very extraordinary outrage committed by a press gang at Margate, on Tuesday se’nnight as related by the parties who were the sufferers:—</p>
<p>About ten o’clock at night, Mr. Lancells, who is grocer and tallow chandler, was going round his premises with a lantern, as was his usual custom, to see every part was safe from the danger of fire, when he heard a voice exclaim, “Who is that fellow with the lantern ?” Mr. Lancells replied, “Who calls me that fellow ?” The Captain instantly ordered his men to seize and take him to the boat. Mr. Lancells informed him that he was a constable, and commanded the Captain in the King’s name to keep the peace, and added that he was a tradesman, a housekeeper and in all those capacities exempted from the Impress Act. The only answer was, “D——n his eyes, take him on board.” He was then dragged from his own door in the Market-place to the Pier, where he was overtaken Mr. Gore, the High Constable, who is also Captain of the Volunteers. Mr. Gore interposed his authority, with his staff of office in his hand, upon which the Captain ordered his gang to seize Mr. Gore, which was done accordingly, and he was dragged into the boat after Mr. Lancells, where they were detained near two hours in the rain under a guard of sailors, while the pressgang proceeded round the town, and pressed several other persons as little liable to the impress as Mr. Gore or Mr. Lancells. Among the persons impressed was Mr. Brett, the farmer, North Down, near Margate. The Civil Power was at an end; the officers of the law being impressed, Mr. Brett had no one to apply to for protection, bur was obliged to submit to the same violence the other gentlemen had suffered. They were all taken on board the Texel, where Mr. Gore happening to know the pilot, received some civilities. The Captain of the Texel was bed, it being three o’clock in the morning when they reached the ship : but Captain Byng was no sooner informed what had happened, than he invited Mr. Gore and Mr. Lancells to breakfast, and made them every apology for the outrage that had been committed, expressing the deepest concern for their sufferings, and informed that his boat should take them on shore whenever they pleased to depart from the ship. They were accordingly landed at Margate on the evening of the day after they had been impressed.</p>

<p>Personal contacts were also used to save several young apprentices from the press, as is demonstrated in this example:</p>

British Press - Saturday 16 April 1803</p>
<p>POLICE. MANSION-HOUSE. Thursday four Master tradesmen waited upon the Lord Mayor, and thanked him for the order which his Lordship sent with Mr. Nelson, the Deputy Water-Bailiff, for the liberation of their apprentices, who were impressed on Monday last, as they were going down the river to amuse themselves at Greenwich. In the course of their address, they detailed the particulars of the great trouble and inconvenience which they experienced in the present case ; and insisted, that they being Freemen and Liverymen of London, and their apprentices being bound for the freedom of the city, the latter were not liable to be impressed, and that consequently the conduct of the press-gang, who had so impressed them, was a violation of the rights and privileges of the city of London.</p>
<p>The Lord Mayor answered, that he should be always ready to protect the liberties of the city of London, and commended the Gentlemen for their exertions upon the present occcasion.</p>

<p>Geography also appears to have played a role in denying the activities of the press in the following case, although whether it is to be believed may be another matter!</p>

It is stated that the boat belonging to the press-gang was seized by the inhabitants, and carried ashore, and that a confidential officer was dispatched to London, to remonstrate on the subject. We are not inciined to give any credit to this statement.</p>
</div>
<p>Sometimes, however, the threat of impressment might seem to be considered a useful situation to be in!</p>

<p>PRESS-GANGS.</p>
<p>The scandalous outrages that have been committed by Press-Gangs, call for the immediate interference of the Board ot Admiralty. Custom and State necessity authorise the practice of impressing seamen; buc it never was intended, that persons not accustomed to a sea-faring life, and pursuing useful industry, should be deprived of their liberty, dragged like felons through the streets, beat and cut with hangers, and put on board a tender, merely becuase it pleased a set of ruffians, called a Press-Gang.</p>
<p>At Union-Hall, on Friday, William Wortley deposed, that on the preceding morning, about eleven o’clock, as he was going up Tooler-street, where he had been in the discharge of his duty, he saw several persons standing near the corner of the Bridge-yard, who, from their appearance, he took to be a press-gang. Seeing they had stopped a man, whom he heard them ask for his protection, he stopped for a minute, to see how it would end. A man of the gang came to him; and said, “What business have you here ?” The witness replied, “I certainly have as much right here as you.” He was then asked, ” If he had, ever been at sea ?” He replied he had been two or three times to Gravesend, for pleasure, but no further. Just upon this, the prisoner in custody, who acted as the officer of the gang, consisting of nine men, came up, and ther man, who had been speakiog to the witness, said, “Here is a volunteer.” This Wortley denied, telling him he was a police-officer. This did not satisfy the other; for he seized him bythe collar, and said, “you are a volunteer, and shall go along with us.” The witness then putting his hand to his coat pocket to pull out his book, and produce his warrants of appointment, one as a police-offiqer, and the other on the impress service; the prisoner, without further cerenony, pulled his cutlass from under his, coat, and gave Wortley so severe a cut on the head, through his hat, that he had nearly bled to death before the wound was dressed. Before he became quite insensible, he requested that he might be taken to some neighbouring surgeon’s, to have his wound dressed ; but this was refused. The men then under the direction of the prisoner, dragged him to Mill Stairs, laid him in their boat, (for he could not sit up) and took him on board the tender, where the surgeon dressed his wound. Several persons deposed to the same effect.</p>
<p>The prisoner is a press-master, who is employed under the Lieutenant who has the charge of the impress fervice, but had not any warrant.</p>
<p>The Magistrate said, that the prisoner had exercised the authority reposed in him in a scandalous and cruel manner. He was immediately ordered to be committed to take his trial for the offence, and the complainant was left to the care of the surgeon.</p>
<p>James Bennet was also ordered to find bail, for having assaulted the boy, and the names of the whole gang were sent to the Admiralty, with an account of their conduct.</p>

<p class="admonition-title"><em>Atrocious circumstances and disrepute</em>, April, 1803</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0002593/18030416/018/0004">https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0002593/18030416/018/0004</a>
General Evening Post - Saturday 16 April 1803</p>
<p>Union Hall—Yesterday one of those atrocious circumstances that in their tendency bring Government and their Officers into disrepute, and which are generally occasioned by the cruel and intemperate conduct of some, and the rapacity and indiscretion of others. Officers and persons under them in the impress service, came on to be heard before Mr. Carpenter Smith and Mr. Fournier, the Sitting Magistrates.</p>
<p>As we do not wish in the smallest degree to irritate the public mind, or prejudge the accused person, we lay a simple narrative of the transaction before our readers.</p>
<p><em>William Wortley</em>, one of the Police Officers attending this Office, was in Tooley-street about 11 o’clock in the forenoon in the execution of his duty; at the corner of the Bridge-yard, he saw several persons standing, whom he conjectured to be a press-gang; on coming up, he found that he was right, as they had just stopt a man, whom they were asking for his proteetion. He (W.) stopt on the kirb ; when a man of the gang came up and shoved him, and a boy into the street, faying, “What business have you here ?” Wortley replied—” I believe I have as much business here as you.” Some farther conversation took place, in the course of which the man asked if he had ever been at sea? He said, he had made two or three Gravesend voyages for pleasure, but never farther. Just at this period, Mr. Press-Master, the prisoner, came up ; when the man in question said, ” Here’s a volunteer.” Wortley denied this, said he was a Police Officer, and would produce his warrant; this would not satisfy the Officer, as he called himfelf ; but he collared him; and on Wortley’s putting his hand back to take his book out of his pocket to produce his warrant of appointment, drew from under his coat a cutlass, with which he struck him so violent a blow on the head as to cut through his hat to the length of four inches in the front slantwise toward the right temple; his head was cut to the length of two inches and upwards, and of so great a depth as to render it astonishing that the unfortunate man survived long enough to be taken on board the tender, and have his wounds dressed. In vain did the poor man beg he might be allowed to go to a Surgeon in the neighbourhood to have his head dressed. In vain did some of the most respectable of the neighbours state that he was a Police Officer, to their knowledge, and that it surely must be improper to take him in the shocking state he was in, when they could not keep him. This was replied to, by a drawn cutlass being flourished at them, with a declaration, that if they interfered with him he would serve them the same as he did him. He was then by the Press-Master’s order dragged away from thence to Mill-Stairs, some distance from where the occurrence happened, put on board their galley, laid along (for he was unable to sit up), and c onveyed to the tender, where the surgeon dressed his head, which he declared was so hurt, the material blood vessels being separated, that unless he was extremely careful his life would be endangered.</p>
<p><em>Mr. Little</em>, <em>Mr. York Hatton</em>, <em>Mr. Eamer</em>, and <em>Mr. Perkins</em>, all resident shopkeepers on the spot, and who were present when the business happened, corrobororated the evidence, and deposed as to the cruel and intemperate conduct of the prisoner.</p>
<p>It is scarcely necessary to observe, that in a place like Tooley-street such a transaction just at noon day could not pass unnoticed, and still less that it would pass without exciting the most marked indignation of the populace. Fortunately for the public quiet, Mr. Fournier, the Magistrate arrived and promised the persons present that every proper step should be taken to punish the guilty parties.</p>
<p>As soon as Mr. Fournier arrived at the office, he, with the advice and conjunction of his brother Magistrate, sent to the, Commanding Officer of the tender off the Tower, to send this Press-Master and his gang to the office as prisoners, and release their officer; this was immediately complied with. The Press-Master had <em>not any Warrant to impress any person</em>, nor had any person with him. He said, he acted under the verbal orders of his employer, Lieut. Denham, who was not present at the transaction.</p>
<p>Lieut. Denha, being before the Magistrates, was asked to produce his press warrant. He did. On reading it, Mr. Smith observed, that ” there was an express direction contained in it, that his power should not be delegated or transferred to any other; and that no proceedings should be had under it, unless he was personally present.” Lieut. D. admitted this: only observing, that this person having been a Master’s mate, and coming to him very strongly recommended, he thought he might safely entrust him in the execution of the duty; but he denied having given him any directions to go in the streets to impress any passengers—he was not to do so, unless he found them corning or going out of any boat about the stairs by the river side.</p>
<p>The Magistrates, conceiving there was sufficient evidence before them, fully committed the press-master to the county gaol until the prosecutor is out of danger, and his busy assistant until he finds bail.</p>
