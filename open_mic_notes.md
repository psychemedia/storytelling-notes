# Open Mic Notes

Notes and reflections from open mic nights

## Reverse soundcheck

At the Raily Inn, Ryde, a plugged night generally, I went on after a young lad playing electic guitar to a Metallica soundtrack.

My "soundcheck" was a reverse soundcheck, stood the audience side of mic and monitors. "This is a reverse soundcheck. I'l set my speaking level — can you hear me — and the audience sets the amplification level by sucking out the (ambient) sound from the room. We create the level together."

It also struck me — the guitarist with mic and amp forces a sound level onto the room. The storyteller forces quietness. The guitarist tries to make you listen, and ensures that everyone can hear, even above the chatter, by being loud. The storyteller tries to shut everyone up, so everyone can hear because it is quiet. And it is as much up to those who want to listen the force the quiet on the room as it is the storyteller. In the same way that the story exists in the space between the teller and listener, and is co-created by them, so the novice level is set by a combination of the two. And as I learned, I think from one of Stewart Lee's annotated script books, the way to make yourself heard over folk talking in the audience is for you *to talk more quietly*.
