# About These Storynotes

Several years ago, after twenty-five years of listening to traditional stories and visiting storytelling festivals, I started telling myself, at folk-nights and open mics, slowly building up to performing shows with others, and as a solo performer.

Many of the stories I tell are stories I have heard other tellers tell, tales which they may well have heard from other tellers in turn, in an unbroken oral tradition that may spread back years, decades, centuries or even more.

Traditionally told stories are spoken, not read; they are typically *not* recited, at least, not fromn the head. In the same way that an elderly relative may tell the same story again and again, with very little variation from one telling to the next, so a storyteller may use many of the same words from one telling of a particular story to another. But the repetition doesn't arise from the stroyteller engaging in the rote memorisation of a carefully written script that they can faithfully reproduce, as an actor sticks to a playwright's script. Rather, the teller has developed a familiar route through the tale that they desctribe as it unravels itself, in the space between the teller and the audience, the teller and the listener. The storyteller is free to change the route, to respond to any sounds or events that may be happening around them, to modify the telling to suit that particular audience at that particular time in that particular place.

repetition of the tales, some differences between them may jump out, or the exact repetition may serve to set down pathways that can be retrodden; this is paritucularly useful if the teller is keen to retell a particular variant in a fairly close way, subject to their own forgetting and recovery.
