# Emperor's New Clothes, -ish

Once, there was a King. He hadn't been the King for very long, because in that place, the kings would come and go.

On very rare occasions, they would live to an old age, and the kingdom would pass to the their oldest son, or to a successor nominated with the King's dying breath. More commonly, they would be killed on the battle field, and replaced by the victor, or killed by an over-ambitious member of their own family, by poison, or by knife.

There was one thing, however, that each King had in common with the last. Their sense of entitlement to the throne. Once the throne was theirs, they could do with whatever they liked.

In those days, the King and his court had little interest in the people of the place. As long as there was a bounteous supply of food on the table, as long as there was a ready availability of soldiers to fight whatever war the King fancied indulging in, as long as there were pretty hot and cold running chambermaids, the King would be happy.

The King's subjects also had little regard for him. For sure, they would complain about the way they lived compared to the way the King lived, but what could they do? For most of them, they just got on with their lives as best they could, and largely ignored the King.

Things could be a little bit more tense if you lived as part of the King's court, though. For sure, there were the feasts, the parties, the lavish surroundings. But there was also the chance that the King might take issue with something you said, or did, and then: kiiiiich [throat cut]... So: you had to take care.

Every so often, entertainers would pass through the court, hoping to receive the King's indulgence; rich merchants with fine wares to sell: carpets, tapestries, slaves, or jewels; or craftsmen, craftsmen seeking patronage.

One time, a wine merchant came to the palace with a cart load of very old wine from a famous vineyard. Boxes and boxes of dusty old wine crates. The wine merchant persuaded the King it was the finest of wines, the __oldest__ of vintages, and that, if it tasted a little bit unusual, well, that was because it was an acquired taste, that the classic vintage wines of the golden age of wines had a taste so powerful, a taste so rich, a taste so complex, that only those with the most sophisticated palates would be able to appreciate it fully. So when the King tasted the wine, and was all but ready to spit it out with the intensity of the acid notes that burned his lips and scorched the back of his throat, when he saw his advisers screw their eyes up in pain, but then follow the "argghh...yeurchh.... ahhhh" look of, well, ecstatic delight, apparently, as they followed the lead of the wine merchant, the King, too managed to swallow the wine, and compliment the wine merchant. And so the wine was bought. And every so often, a bottle would be opened and every one would, eeeyerchchhh, pfflt... yes, a very powerful vintage, yes, lovely, an excellent vintage. You certainly don't get anything quite like that any more. That said, on one occasion, one of the guests, when offered the wine, immediately spat it back into the goblet with a shriek of "that's undrinkable". But when the King glared back at him in anger, and the other guests and advisers looked on in fear, he realised he had perhaps put himself at some sort of personal risk for disrespecting the King, and quickly thought of a way out: "I mean, well, sire, we should not be drinking this so casually. It is surely far too valuable for that. It surely should be regarded as, regarded as.." and as he looked pleadingly around the assembled guests, at the assembled advisers, as the assembled Bishop's... "as an... an in-vestment...". And everyone who had been holding their breath let out a great sigh, they realised that was a perfect answer. And that they would never have to drink it again if it was that valuable.

Another time, when the King was putting up taxes, "put them up, all of them, all of them", a wealthy banker explained that whilst it was right for the farmers and the craftsmen to pay taxes, because they could easily grow more things and make more things, and could easily give some of those extra things to the King as a form of tax, it would be foolish for bankers to pay taxes. "Think of it like this, sire", he explained. "If I am a farmer, I can grow so many vegetables, and I can give you one of them. But if I am a banker, I just move money around; so if I have to give you some of the money each time I move it, well, it would just keep getting less, until there was none left". And the King saw that this was true, and so he let the bankers off paying any taxes at all. And because the King's advisers also spent a lot of their time moving their own money around, they saw the truth of this argument too and congratulated the King on adopting such a wise policy.

A third time, there came to the court two tailors. "Your majesty," they said, "your majesty. We have heard tell that you are to lead a procession through the city to celebrate your birthday. We have travelled far, we have travelled wide, and we have learned many things. In particular, we have learned how to weave cloth of the finest thread, a thread so fine, a thread so strong, that even a gossamer thread would be as a thick, ugly coil of knotted, seaweed encrusted rope beside it. The design of such a cloth, the pattern, will be so finely detailed that it can only be appreciated, that it can only be seen, by the most discerning of people. We would like to make a suit of clothes from this thread for you, for your birthday, sire, for your procession. A suit of clothes the like of which no-one has ever seen before, or is likely to ever see again."

Well, the King was much pleased by this idea. After all, wasn't he entitled to the best of everything? And wasn't he the most discerning of all people. And so, with his advisers, judging the King's mood, quickly agreeing that it would be splendid idea, the tailors were hired.

"Let them want for nothing", said the King, "let them have whatever they need", and so the two tailors were given an apartment each to stay in and a workshop to work in.

After a few days, the King, who was not the most patient of men, started to ask "is it ready yet? Is it ready yet?" and sent one of his advisers to see. The adviser went to the workshop, and knocked at the door. The sound of laughing and talking stopped, and there was the sound of what looked like chairs being pulled across the floor. 

Busy man, didn't really have time for this, on man working other man talking, bored him, "is that the time? Must be going. Don't let e interrupt you any more.

Busy working....

Suddenly, the door was opened by one of the weavers, and the King's adviser looked into the room. There was stuff everywhere, reels and reels of silk threads, spinning wheels, carding frames and a loom. The weaver dragged the adviser in, and started explaining things to him, explaining all work that had to be done, all the steps in the process, how this had be turned like that than this thing would do that thing to the other thing and so on. For what felt like hours. After which the adviser was bundled out of the room. The King asked him how the clothes were looking, and the adviser realised that, he wasn't sure whether he'd actually seen any of the fine material, let alone any new clothes, but he couldn't admit that, and there had obviously been a lot of some sort of industry going on in that room, so the work must be good, and when he realised he had to say something, all he could say was how impressed he was by the tour he had been given of the workshop. And he didn't tell a lie. ... complicated, lots of detail...

The next day, the King sent another of his advisers to check on the tailors. Now this adviser liked a drink, and when he knocked on the door, loudly calling as he did so, he was invited and, and offered a drink before the tour. And he said he didn't mind if he did. And thankyou, yes, another would be very much appreciated to. And all the while, the tailors told him about what they were doing, and they told him some more, and they told him again and, as the bottle was now nearly empty, "Oh is that really the time, we really must be getting on", and the adviser left.

Any when he was asked about the progress the talors were making? "It's incredible, it's absolutely unbelievable". And he didn't tell a lie.

And although he feared offending the King, he feared offending the King very much, he did not tell a lie. "How were the clothes? Well, I never did see such a thing!' he said. And it was true. He never had. But he didn't tell a lie.

Drink, not actually saw it

"I have never seen anything like it", still confused about what he had actually seen

It's just rags... Dirty stinky old rags.

??? need different sorts of deception: self-doubt, self-interest, fear of consequences


?? Did not tell a lie variant - not lying to power
?? little lie then big lie variant - 
?? tell truth, but King doesn't believe them - telling truth to power


original - court of fools and incompetents; every one with any shred of ability would soon find themselves out of a job, at best, dead at worst.

??in another court they all become politicians...


Maybe the tailors visit several different courts? Tailors frame tale?
