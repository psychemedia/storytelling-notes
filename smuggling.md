A Smuggler's Song

If you wake at midnight, and hear a horse's feet,
Don't go drawing back the blind, or looking in the street;
Them that ask no questions isn't told a lie.
Watch the wall, my darling, while the Gentlemen go by!

Five and twenty ponies,
Trotting through the dark —
Brandy for the Parson,
Baccy for the Clerk;
Laces for a lady, letters for a spy,
And watch the wall, my darling,
While the Gentlemen go by!

Running round the woodlump if you chance to find
Little barrels, roped and tarred, all full of brandy-wine,
Don't you shout to come and look, nor use 'em for your play.
Put the brishwood back again — and they'll be gone next day!

If you see the stable-door setting open wide;
If you see a tired horse lying down inside;
If your mother mends a coat cut about and tore;
If the lining's wet and warm — don't you ask no more!

If you meet King George's men, dressed in blue and red,
You be careful what you say, and mindful what is said.
If they call you "pretty maid," and chuck you 'neath the chin,
Don't you tell where no one is, nor yet where no one's been!

Knocks and footsteps round the house — whistles after dark —
You've no call for running out till the house-dogs bark.
Trusty's here, and Pincher's here, and see how dumb they lie —
They don't fret to follow when the Gentlemen go by!

If you do as you've been told, 'likely there's a chance,
You'll be given a dainty doll, all the way from France,
With a cap of Valenciennes, and a velvet hood —
A present from the Gentlemen, along o' being good!

Five and twenty ponies,
Trotting through the dark —
Brandy for the Parson,
'Baccy for the Clerk;
Them that asks no questions isn't told a lie —
Watch the wall, my darling,
While the Gentlemen go by!

The Listeners
BY WALTER DE LA MARE
‘Is there anybody there?’ said the Traveller,
Knocking on the moonlit door;
And his horse in the silence champed the grasses
Of the forest’s ferny floor:
And a bird flew up out of the turret,
Above the Traveller’s head:
And he smote upon the door again a second time;
‘Is there anybody there?’ he said.
But no one descended to the Traveller;
No head from the leaf-fringed sill
Leaned over and looked into his grey eyes,
Where he stood perplexed and still.
But only a host of phantom listeners
That dwelt in the lone house then
Stood listening in the quiet of the moonlight
To that voice from the world of men:
Stood thronging the faint moonbeams on the dark stair,
That goes down to the empty hall,
Hearkening in an air stirred and shaken
By the lonely Traveller’s call.
And he felt in his heart their strangeness,
Their stillness answering his cry,
While his horse moved, cropping the dark turf,
’Neath the starred and leafy sky;
For he suddenly smote on the door, even
Louder, and lifted his head:—
‘Tell them I came, and no one answered,
That I kept my word,’ he said.
Never the least stir made the listeners,
Though every word he spake
Fell echoing through the shadowiness of the still house
From the one man left awake:
Ay, they heard his foot upon the stirrup,
And the sound of iron on stone,
And how the silence surged softly backward,
When the plunging hoofs were gone.

The Pied Piper of Newtown
England
Newtown, or Franchville, as 'twas called of old, is a sleepy little town, upon the Solent shore. Sleepy as it is now, it was once noisy enough, and what made the noise was -- rats. The place was so infested with them as to be scarce worth living in. There wasn't a barn or a corn-rick, a storeroom or a cupboard, but they ate their way into it. Not a cheese but they gnawed it hollow, not a sugar puncheon but they cleared out. Why the very mead and beer in the barrels was not safe from them. They'd gnaw a hole in the top of the tun, and down would go one master rat's rail, and when he brought it up round would crowd all the friends and cousins, and each would have a suck at the tail.
Had they stopped here it might have been borne. But the squeaking and shrieking, the hurrying and scurrying, so that you could neither hear yourself speak nor get a wink of good honest sleep the live-long night! Not to mention that mamma must needs sit up and keep watch and ward over baby's cradle, or there'd have been a big ugly rat running across the poor little fellow's face, and doing who knows what mischief.
Why didn't the good people of the town have cats? Well they did, and there was a fair stand-up fight, but in the end the rats were too many, and the pussies were regularly driven from the field.
Poison, I hear you say? Why, they poisoned so many that it fairly bred a plague.
Ratcatchers! Why there wasn't a ratcatcher from John o' Groat's house to the Land's End that hadn't tried his luck. But do what they might, cats or poison, terrier or traps, there seemed to be more rats than ever, and every day a fresh rat was socking his tail or pricking his whiskers.
The mayor and the town council were at their wits' end. As they were sitting one day in the town hall racking their poor brains and bewailing their hard fate, who should run in but the town beadle. "Please, your honor," says he, "here is a very queer fellow come to town. I don't rightly know what to make of him."
"Show him in," said the mayor, and in he stepped.
A queer fellow, truly, For there wasn't a color of the rainbow but you might find it in some corner of his dress, and he was tall and thin, and had keen piercing eyes. "I'm called the Pied Piper," he began. "And pray what might you be willing to pay me, if I rid you of every single rat in Franchville?"
Well, much as they feared the rats, they feared parting with their money more, and fain would they have higgled and haggled. But the piper was not a man to stand nonsense, and the upshot was that fifty pounds were promised him (and it meant a lot of money in those old days) as soon as not a rat was left to squeak or scurry in Franchville.
Out of the hall stepped the piper, and as he stepped he laid his pipe to his lips and a shrill keen tune sounded through street and house. And as each note pierced the air you might have seen a strange sight. For out of every hole the rats came tumbling. There were none too old and none too young, none too big and none too little to crowd at the piper's heels and with eager feet and upturned noses to patter after him as he paced the streets. Nor was the piper unmindful of the little toddling ones, for every fifty yards he'd stop and give an extra flourish on his pipe just to give them time to keep up with the older and stronger of the band.
Up Silver Street he went, and down Gold Street, and at the end of Gold Street is the harbor and the broad Solent beyond. And as he paced along, slowly and gravely, the townsfolk flocked to door and window, and many a blessing they called down upon his head.
As for getting near him there were too many rats. And now that he was at the water's edge he stepped into a boat, and not a rat, as he shoved off into deep water, piping shrilly all the while, but followed him, plashing, paddling, and wagging their tails with delight. On and on he played and played until the tide went down, and each master rat sank deeper and deeper in the slimy ooze of the harbor, until every mother's son of them was dead and smothered.
The tide rose again, and the piper stepped on shore, but never a rat followed. You may fancy the townsfolk had been throwing up their caps and hurrahing and stopping up rat holes and setting the church bells a-ringing. But when the piper stepped ashore, and not so much as a single squeak was to be heard, the mayor and the council, and the townsfolk generally, began to hum and to haw and to shake their heads.
For the town money chest had been sadly emptied of late, and where was the fifty pounds to come from? Such an easy job, too! Just getting into a boat and playing a pipe! Why the mayor himself could have done that if only he had thought of it.
So he hummed and hawed and at last, "Come, my good man," said he. "You see what poor folk we are. How can we manage to pay you fifty pounds? Will you not take twenty? When all is said and done, 'twill be good pay for the trouble you've taken."
"Fifty pounds was what I bargained for," said the piper shortly, "and if I were you I'd pay it quickly, for I can pipe many kinds of tunes, as folk sometimes find to their cost."
"Would you threaten us, you strolling vagabond?" shrieked the mayor, and at the same time he winked to the council. "The rats are all dead and drowned," muttered he; and so, "You may do your worst, my good man," and with that he turned short upon his heel.
"Very well," said the piper, and he smiled a quiet smile. With that he laid his pipe to his lips afresh, but now there came forth no shrill notes, as it were, of scraping and gnawing, and squeaking and scurrying, but the tune was joyous and resonant, full of happy laughter and merry play. And as he paced down the streets the elders mocked, but from schoolroom and playroom, from nursery and workshop, not a child but ran out with eager glee and shout following gaily at the piper's call. Dancing, laughing, joining hands and tripping feet, the bright throng moved along up Gold Street and down Silver Street, and beyond Silver Street lay the cool green forest full of old oaks and wide-spreading beeches. In and out among the oak trees you might catch glimpses of the pipers many-colored coat. You might hear the laughter of the children break and fade and die away as deeper and deeper into the lone green wood the stranger went, and the children followed.
All the while, the elder watched and waited. They mocked no longer now. And watch and wait as they might, never did they set their eyes again upon the piper in his parti-colored coat. Never were their hearts gladdened by the song and dance of the children issuing forth from amongst the ancient oaks of the forest.

You may have heard the phrase "flotsam and jetsam" to describe various bits and bobs you might find floating in the sea?


https://archive.org/details/commentariesonla00blac_003
It is to be observed, that, in order lo constitute a legal *wreck*, the goods must come to land. If they continue at sea, the law distinguishes them by the barbarous and uncouth appelations of *jetsam*, *flotsam* and *ligan*. Jetsam is where goods are cast into the sea, and there sink and remain under water: flotsam is where they continue swimming on the surface of the waves: ligan is where they are sunk in the sea, but tied to a cork or buoy, in order to be found again. These are also the king's, if no owner appears to claim them; but if any owner appears he is entitled to recover the possession. For even if they be cast overboard, without any mark or buoy, in order to lighten the ship, the owner is not by tins act of necessity construed to have renounced his property: much less can things ligan be supposed to be abandoned, since the owner has done all in his power to assert and retain his property. These three are therefore accounted so far a distinct thing from the former, that by the king's grant to a man of wrecks, things jetsam, flotsam, and ligan will not pass.
Wrecks in their legal acceptation, are at present not very frequent: for, if any goods come to land, it rarely happens, 
since the improvement of commerce, navigation, and correspondence, that the owner is not able to assert his property 
within the year and day limited by law. And in order to 
preserve this property entire for him and if possible to prevent wrecks at all, our laws have made many very humane 
regulations; in a spirit quite opposite to those savage laws, 
which formerly prevailed in all the northern regions of 
Europe, and a few years ago were still said to subsist on the 
coasts of the Baltic sea, permitting the inhabitants to seize 
on whatever they could get as lawful prize: or, as an author 
of their own expresses it, *in naufragorum miseria et calamitate tanquam vultures ad praedam currere* [?in the wave of misery and disaster, run after their prey like vultures]. For by the 
statute 37 Edw. III. c. 13. if any ship be lost on the shore, 
and the goods come to land, (which cannot, says the statute,
be called wreck,} they shall be presently delivered to the merchants, paying only a reasonable reward to those that saved 
and preserved them, which is entitled *salvage*. Also by the 
common law, if any persons (other than the sheriff) take any 
goods so cast on shore, which are not legal wreck, the owners might have a commission to inquire and find them out, 
and compel them to make restitution. And by statute 12 Ann. St. 2. c. 18. confirmed by 4 Geo. I. c. 12. in order to 
assist the distressed, and prevent the scandalous illegal practices on some of our sea coasts, (too similar to those on the 
Baltic,) it is enacted, that all head-officers and others of towns 
near the sea shall, upon application made to them, summon 
as many hands as are necessary, and send them to the relief 
of any ship in distress, on forfeiture of 100/. and, in case of 
assistance given, salvage shall be paid by the owners, to be , 
assessed by three neighbouring justices. All persons that 
secrete any goods shall forfeit their treble value: 
 and if they wilfully do any act whereby the ship is 
lost or destroyed, by making holes in her, stealing 
her pumps, or otherwise, they are guilty of felony, without 
benefit of clergy. Lastly, by the statute 26 Geo. II. c. 19, 
plundering any vessel either in distress, or wrecked, and 
whether any living creature be on board, or not, (for, whether wreck or otherwise, it is clearly not the property of the 
populace,) such plundering, I say, or preventing the escape 
of any person that endeavours to save his life, or wounding 
him with intent to destroy him, or putting out fiUse lights 
in order to bring any vessel into danger, are all declared to 
be capital felonies; in like manner as the destroying of trees, 
steeples, or other stated sea-marks, is punished by the statute 8 Eliz. c. 13. with a forfeiture of 100/. or outlawry^ 
Moreover, by the statute of George II, pilfering any goods 
cast ashore is declared to be petty larceny; and many other- 
salutary regulations are made for the more effectually pre- 
serving ships of any nation in distress. 
[By the civil law, to destroy persons shipwrecked, or prevent their saving the ship, is capital. And to steal even a plank from a vessel in distress, or wrecked, makes the party liable to answer for the whole ship and cargo. The laws also of the Wisigoths, and the most early Neapolitan constitutions, punished with the utmost severity all those who neglected to assist any ship in distress, or plundered any goods cast on shore.]


https://www.gov.uk/guidance/wreck-and-salvage-law
According to section 255 of the Merchant Shipping Act 1995, the definition of wreck includes "jetsam, flotsam, lagan and derelict found in or on the shores of the sea or any tidal water”.
Jetsam describes goods cast overboard to lighten a vessel in danger of sinking. The vessel may still perish.
Flotsam describes goods lost from a ship which has sunk or otherwise perished. Goods are recoverable because they remain afloat.
Lagan describes goods cast overboard from a ship which afterwards perishes. The goods are buoyed so they can be recovered.


http://www.duhaime.org/LegalDictionary/F/Flotsam.aspx
William Blackstone, at paragraph 292 of his Commentaries on the Laws of England, Book I, wrote eloquently:
"... in order to constitute a legal wreck, the goods must come to land. If they continue at sea, the law distinguishes them by the barbarous and uncouth appellations of jetsam, flotsam and ligan.
"Jetsam is where goods are cast into the sea and there sink and remain under water.
"Flotsam is where they continue swimming on the surface of the waves.
"Ligan is where they are sunk in the sea, but tied to a cork or buoy in order to be found again."

https://www.beachcombingmagazine.com/blogs/news/flotsam-and-jetsam
Sir William Blackstone (1723-1780) was an English lawyer, judge, and Tory politician who spent a good amount of time researching and studying jurisprudence and was most famous for writing Commentaries on the Laws of England, which was published in four volumes between 1765 and 1769. He penned these eloquent words about his country’s maritime laws, "...in order to constitute a legal wreck, the goods must come to land. If they continue at sea, the law distinguishes them by the barbarous and uncouth appellations of jetsam, flotsam, and ligan.”
Why is the difference important? Because under maritime law, salvaged items may or may not be claimed by the finder depending on whether they are flotsam or jetsam. And determining if debris is flotsam or jetsam rests solely on why it ended up in the water.
Flotsam, because it was unintentionally cast to the sea, may be claimed by its original owner, and not one who recovers it. Goods or items that float to the surface and eventually to the shore from a sunken vessel may be classified as flotsam. Generally, salvagers may keep the items they find if no one comes forward to lay claim to the found objects but they will have little legal claim to them if the original owners stake a claim. Storied sunken treasure ships, when eventually found, usually make the news as court cases certainly follow. Once ownership is established (typically by the country that owned the ships hundreds of years ago), proving the wreckage was unintentional all but guarantees the flotsam will be returned to its original owner, and rarely to the person who found it.
Jetsam, because it was intentionally tossed into the water—usually thrown overboard to lighten the load when a ship was in distress—may sometimes be claimed by a lucky rescuer who discovers the discarded items. However, there have been instances where legal claims were successfully made by the jettisoning owner to retrieve their property. 

"Flotsam" refers to goods that are floating on the surface of the water as the result of a wreck or an accident. As there is no clear way of defining ownership, one who discovers flotsam is allowed to claim it, unless someone claims ownership to the items in question.
Jetsam  designates any cargo that is intentionally discarded from a ship or wreckage. Legally jetsam also floats, although floating is not part of the etymological meaning.[8] Generally, "jettisoning" connotes the action of throwing goods overboard to lighten the load of the ship if it is in danger of sinking.Per maritime law, one who discovers these artifacts is not required to return them to their rightful owner except in the case that the latter makes a legally abiding claim


If the items are washed ashore, however, then the laws of the land come into play.

Around the 1300s, the law of the sea, maritime law, was in its infancy. One of the earliest formulations was know as the *The Rolls of Oleron* (Rôles d´Oleron), named after the Île d'Oléron, an island due west of Rochefort, half way up the Atlantic coast of France, and which looks a little like a stretched Isle of Wight tipped on its side. Also known as the Judgments of the Sea [ Jugemens de la mer], they were codified some time in the 1200s and to a large extent helped regulate the shipping of goods associated with the wine trade from Brittany and Normandy to England, Scotland and Flanders, which is to say, the North European coastal areas around the Netherlands, Belgium and North Eastern France; by 1336, they had been included in the Black Book of the Admiralty and from then on were applied by Admiralty Courts, where necessary. But they would almost certainly have been know to seafarers twenty years before: as a maritime nation, coastal areas of England also lived as much by the law of the sea as the law of the land. 

In the Rolls of Oleron, 
Article XXXII - oleron
If by reason of tempestuous weather, it be thought expedient, for the lightening of any ship or vessel at sea, or riding at anchor in any road, to cast part of the lading overboard, and it be done accordingly for the common safety, though the said goods so ejected, and cast over-board, do become his that can first possess himself thereof, and carry them away
Article XXXIII
If a ship, or any other vessel, hath cast overboard several goods or merchandises, which are in chests well locked and made fast; or books well clasped and shut close, that they may not be damnified by salt water; in such cases it is to be presumed, that they who did cast such goods overboard, do still retain an intention, hope, and desire of recovering the same: for which reason, such as shall happen to find such things, are obliged to make restitution thereof to him who shall make a due enquiry after them; or put them to pious uses, according to his conscience and the advice of some prudent neighbor.
Article XLIII
In all other things found by the sea side, which have formerly been in the possession of some one or other, as wines, oil, and other merchandize, although they have been cast overboard, and left by the merchants, and so ought to appertain to him that first finds the same; yet herein also the custom of the country is to be observed as well as in the case of fish. But if there be a presumption that these were the goods of some ship that perished, then neither the said lord, nor finder thereof, shall take any, to convert any part of it to their own use; but as has been said, distribute the money it produces amongst the poor and needy.
Article XXXIV
If any man happens to find any thing in the sea, or in the sand on the shore, in floods or in rivers, if it be precious stones, fishes, or any treasure of the sea, which never belonged to any man in point of property, it belongs to the first finder.
Article XXXVI
If any going along the sea-shore to fish, or otherwise, happens to find gold or silver, he shall be bound to make restitution thereof, deducting for his own pains; or if he be poor he may keep it to himself that is, if he knows not to whom to restore it; yet he shall give notice of the place where he found it, to the neighborhood and parts next adjacent, and advise with his superiors, who ought to weigh and take into consideration the property of the finder, and then to give him such advice as is consonant to good conscience. 

but from shipwrecks. And shipwrecks aplenty there were around that part of the coast.


According to chapter of IV of Edward I's Statute of Westminster of 1275, *CONCERNING Wrecks of the Sea), it was agreed "That where a Man, a Dog, or a Cat escape quick out of the Ship, that such Ship nor Barge, nor any thing within them, shall be adjudged Wreck"; any goods washing ashore from them would be held for a year and a day so that the owner could reclaim them.  
  
What greater temptation could there be for ensuring there were no survivors, and that any goods washing assure were from a wreck with no human, canine or feline survivors.

The Rolls of Oleron and the Admiralty Court in Fourteenth Century England Author(s): Timothy J. Runyan

common law couldn't cope with maritime disputes; court couldn't be heard at oleron; so Admiralty courts set up to administer law according to oleron
 The original version of the laws was probably drawn up in Anglo-Norman in about 1200
hat the Rolls are composed of judgments made by the court at Oleron in maritime disputes and that its decisions were based on custom familiar to most seamen. The Rolls of Oleron, then, are French in origin,12 associated with Aquitaine, and, as a quick reading will show, concern the Gascon wine trade in particular.'13 Because of the great volume of the wine trade between Gascony and England, carried mostly in English ships, the English mariners needed to be familiar with these practices. In fact, this necessity may have precipitated the codification of the laws in England. Their adoption was clear by the reign of Edward III when a Bristol inquest (1351) confirms that the Rolls have the status of law.14 We know also that the Rolls
were used in Castile, Brittany, Normandy, Flanders, and in the Baltic by or after this date
The Rolls of Oleron concern themselves with all aspects of a shipping venture. They are especially informative on the subject
of the relationship of the members of the ship's party to one another and to merchants and owners as well. The master was appointed by the shipowner, and he engaged the mariners by a contractual agreement.16 Mariners were hired in one of three ways. They were paid a set wage for the journey, allowed to freight their own cargo in space allotted them (mareage)'7 or granted a share of
the profits of the freight by the master. 8 Each of these con-
tracts for payment entered into by the mariners ensures that they will be as interested as the master and merchants in the protection of maritime law for themselves and the cargo
The sailors generally made additional money by helping to
load the ship for the merchant
It is evident from this discussion the English seas were not devoid of an extensive code for the regulation of life at sea. W hat is not revealed in a survey of the laws is the administrative machinery established to implement them.
The jurisdictional limits of the admiralty court were neither unchallenged nor as clearly defined as the above might suggest. There were several instances where the court's right to determine a case was challenged by the common law courts
These justices resented the growth of the admiralty court because they claimed it frequently indicted and tried persons without the use of a jury. Also, they questioned its power to hear all infractions of the law which occurred on water. Since the seas do not uniformly cease once they reach land, but are contiguous with rivers and streams, the meaning of "at sea" or "on water" was rather nebulous. The admiralty generally expressed jurisdiction over inland waterways, but only to a point. It was never very clear exactly where that point was. It was for just such reasons that the common law courts ob- jected to the ill-defined, but all too apparent, admiralty cou
We have seen that the admirals were determined to express their authority in a court of law as well as aboard ship, but it is unclear exactly when this court was established. The patent
creating John Paveley admiral in 1360 empowered him to hear
pleas (querelae), and to do justice secundum legem maritimam.62
As we have noted, however, the vice-admiral and his court were functioning before this time. The evidence from a variety of cases indicates that the court originated between 1340 and 1357.6


Medieval Maritime Law from Oléron to
Wisby: Jurisdictions in the Law of the Sea
Edda Frankot 
 Regulations regarding maritime law were recorded in compilations like the Rôles d’Oléron [Rolls of Oléron] and the so-called Wisby Sea Law, which
in the past have been ascribed a wide-spread validity
The existence of various town
laws including maritime regulations suggests, however, that the law of the sea was not
shared between territories at all, but was divided across many small jurisdictions. 
the
fact remains that merchants and skippers involved in overseas trade did have special
needs which were shared by all, for example with regard to gaining justice abroad. So
how were these needs met? 
s increase in carrying capacity of deep-sea vessels resulted in a separation of interests between the shipowners and the owners of the
cargo. Merchants could now afford to buy off their duties aboard the ship and started
to focus solely on trade
The clear division between shipowners, skipper,
freighters and crew which was a result of the thirteenth-century developments, on the
other hand, has continued until today
A mention of the laws in a report written in the 12th year of Edward
III’s reign (1329) confirms that the laws were in use in England in the first half of the
14th century1
 In the later 15th century, some articles
from Lübeck law were added to the text in two stages, resulting in the compilation
which came to be known as the Gotland or Wisby Sea Law
The written maritime laws of Northern Europe can be divided into two groups: the
customary sea laws26 and the maritime regulations in the town laws.
The customary
sea laws on the other hand had come into being as customs or rules of conduct agreed
upon between different groups involved in sea shipping. They were meant to be valid in
a large area, but in themselves lacked an authority to administer justice based on them:
they could only become valid when a group of people accepted them as the law, as happened in Bruges and in some towns in the Netherlands, or when they were enforced
by a (royal) authority, as was the case in France and England,
The customary sea laws were private
law restricted to the problems that arose during the journey and to those involved in sea
trade, whereas urban maritime regulations also contained public law relating to the harbour and the law of wreck. 
For a law to function there needs to be either an authority which can implement such a
law from above or a community of people who swear an oath to abide by that law.
The question remains how the parties decided to which court to bring their case, especially when burghers from several different towns were involved. As mentioned above,
the cases were dealt with by the home court of either one of the parties, by the court of the port of arrival or destination, which may have been different from the home towns
of the involved parties, or, especially in cases of damage to ship and/or cargo, at the port
nearest to where the accident had taken place
n. Medieval maritime traders were, in general, first and
foremost burghers of a town and as such subject to its jurisdiction. When encountering legal problems abroad, practical reasons dictated their decision as to where
they would take their case to court. This would often mean that they had to seek
justice from a foreign legal authority. However, having to deal with different customs
and uses was inherent to medieval international trade, and merchants and skippers
therefore probably did not think much of bringing their matters before the court of
a foreign port where they had in general been granted equal rights to a fair trial as
resident traders.





https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Book_of_the_Admiralty
a compilation of English admiralty law created over the course of several English monarchs' reigns, including the most important decisions of the High Court of Admiralty. Its starting point is the Rolls of Oléron
The book itself states that the High Court of Admiralty was established during the reign of Edward I (1272–1307), although more recent scholarship places the establishment at c. 1360 during the reign of Edward III.[1] Apart from the Rolls of Oléron, the earliest statute referred to is the Liber memorandorum (1338), of which a separate manuscript copy is available in the archives of the City of London.[1]

The law of Maritime Jetison, for instance, as set forth in the thirty-eighth chapter of the compilation of Laws published in the fourth year of William the Conqueror (A.D. 1070) as the Laws of King Edward the Confessor, is the affirmation of a rule by which questions of maritime jetison were then governed, which is not identical with the ancient Law of Rome (Digest, 1. xiv. t. 11), but accords with a more modem usage, such &s we find subsequently reduced into writing in the Rolls ofOlero

Digiest par 3 , book XIV, title II
(See also TItle 1: TITLE I. CONCERNING THE ACTION AGAINST THE OWNER OF A SHIP. cf oleron rolls)
TITLE II. CONCERNING THE RHODIAN LAW OF JETTISON.
1. Paulus, Sentences, Book II.

It is provided by the Rhodian Law that where merchandise is thrown overboard for the purpose of lightening a ship, what has been lost for the benefit of all must be made up by the contribution of all.

2. The Same, On the Edict, Book XXXIV.

When anything has been thrown overboard on account of the distress of a ship, the owners of the lost merchandise must sue the master of the ship on the contract for transportation, if they had entered into an agreement for the carriage of the same; and he can then bring suit against the others whose merchandise was saved, so that the loss may be distributed proportionally. Servius, indeed, answered that they should proceed against the master of the ship under the contract for transportation to compel him to return the merchandise of the others, until they make good their share of the loss. Even though the master does retain the merchandise, he will, in any event, be entitled to an action under the contract for transportation against the passengers.

What is to be done if there are passengers who have no baggage? It evidently will be more convenient to retain their baggage, if there is any; but if there is not, and the party has leased the entire ship, an action can be brought on the contract, just as in the case of passengers who have rented places on a ship; for it is perfectly just that the loss should be partially borne by those who, by the destruction of the property of others, have secured the preservation of their own merchandise.

(1) If the merchandise is saved, and the ship is damaged, or has lost part of her equipment, no contribution should be made, for the condition of the things provided for the use of the ship is different from that on account of which the freight has been received; since, if a blacksmith breaks an anvil or a hammer, this will not be charged to him who hired him to do the work. Where, however, the loss occurred with the consent of the passengers, or on account of their fear, it must be made good.

(2) Where several merchants collect different kinds of goods in the same ship, and, in addition, many passengers, both slaves and freemen, are travelling in it, and a great storm arises, and part of the cargo is necessarily thrown overboard; the question was with respect to the following point, namely, whether it was necessary for all to make good what was thrown overboard; and whether this must also be done by those who had brought on board such merchandise as did not burden the ship; as, for instance, precious stones and pearls, and if this was the case, what portion of the same must be contributed; and whether it was necessary for anything to be paid for freemen, and by what kind of an action proceedings could be instituted? It was held that all those to whose interest it was that the goods should be thrown overboard must contribute, because they owed that contribution on account of the preservation of their property, and therefore even the owner of the ship was liable for his share. The amount of the loss must be distributed in proportion to the value of the property; no appraisement can be made of the persons of freemen; and the owners of the lost property have a right to proceed on the contract for transportation against the sailor, that is the master. An agreement also arose as to whether an estimate was to be made of the clothing and rings of each person, and it was held that this should be done, and that everything should be taken into account for contribution, except what had been brought on board for the purpose of consumption, in which would be included all kinds of provisions; and there is all the more reason in this, for if, at any time during the voyage, such articles should be lacking, each one would contribute what he possessed to the common stock.

(3) If the ship has been ransomed from pirates Servius, Ofilius, and Labeo state that all should contribute; but with reference to what the robbers carried away, the loss must be borne by the party to whom it belonged, and no contribution should be made to him who ransomed his property.

(4) The share is generally contributed in accordance with the valuation of the property which is saved, and of that which is lost; and it makes no difference if that which was lost might have been sold for a higher price, since the contribution relates to loss and not to profit. With reference, however, to those things on account of which contribution must be made, the estimate should be based upon not what they had been purchased for, but upon what they could be sold for.

(5) No estimate should be made of slaves who are lost at sea, any more than where those who are ill die on the ship, or throw themselves overboard.

(6) If any of the passengers should be insolvent, the loss resulting from this will not be suffered by the master of the vessel; for a sailor is not obliged to inquire into the financial resources of everybody.

(7) Where property which has been thrown overboard is recovered, the necessity for contribution is at an end; but if it has already been made, then those who had paid can bring an action on the contract for transportation against the master, and he can proceed under the one for hiring, and return what he recovers.

(8) Any articles thrown overboard belong to the owner of the same, and do not become the property of him who obtains them, because they are not considered as abandoned.

3. Papinianus, Opinions, Book XIX.

Where a mast, or any other part of the equipment of a ship is thrown overboard for the purpose of removing a danger common to all, contribution is required.

4. Callistratus, Questions, Book II.

If, for the purpose of lightening an overloaded ship because she could not enter a river or reach a harbor with her cargo, a certain portion of the merchandise is placed in a boat to prevent the vessel from being in danger outside the river, or at the entrance of the harbor, or in the latter, and the boat is sunk, an account should be taken between those who have their merchandise preserved on the ship and those who lost theirs in the boat, just as if the latter had been thrown overboard. Sabinus also adopts this view in the Second Book of Opinions. On the other hand, if the boat is saved with part of the merchandise, and the ship is lost, no account should be taken with reference to those who lost their property in the ship, because jettison necessitates contribution only where the ship is saved.

(1) But where a ship, which has been lightened in a storm by throwing overboard the goods of a merchant, is sunk in some other place, and the goods of certain merchants are recovered by divers for compensation; Sabinus also says an account must be taken between the party whose goods were thrown overboard during the voyage for the purpose of lightening the ship, and those who subsequently recovered their goods by means of divers. But, on the other hand, no account must be presented by the party whose merchandise was thrown overboard during the voyage to those whose merchandise was not thereby preserved, if any of it was recovered by divers; for it cannot be held to have been thrown overboard for the purpose of saving the ship which was lost.

(2) But where jetsam is made from the ship, and the merchandise of anyone which remained on board, is damaged; it is a matter for consideration whether he should be compelled to contribute, since he ought not to be oppressed by the double loss of contribution and deterioration of his property. The point, however, may be maintained that he should contribute in proportion to the present value of his property. Thus, for example, where the merchandise of two persons was each worth twenty aurei, and that of one of them became only worth ten, on account of having been wet; the party whose property was not damaged should contribute in the proportion of twenty and the other in the proportion of ten.

An opinion can, however, be given in this instance, if we make a distinction as to the cause of the deterioration; that is to say, whether the damage resulted on account of the exposure resulting from throwing the merchandise overboard, or for some other cause; for example, where the merchandise lay somewhere in a corner, and the waves reached it. In this instance the owner will be compelled to contribute, but in the former one, ought he not to be released from the burden of contribution because the jetsam also injured him? Or ought he to be liable even if his goods were deteriorated by the splashing of water on account of the jetsam?

A still finer distinction should be made, namely, as to whether the greater loss is sustained through the damage, or through the contribution; for example, if the merchandise is worth twenty aurei, and the contribution is assessed at ten, the damage, however, amounts to two, and this having been deducted because of the loss, must the owner contribute the remainder? How then if the damage amounted to more than the contribution? For example, if the property was damaged to the amount of ten aurei, and the contribution amounted to two, there is no doubt that the party should not bear both burdens. But here let us see whether a contribution should not be made to him; for what difference does it make whether I lose my property by its being thrown overboard, or have it deteriorated by being exposed? For just as relief is granted to a party for the loss of his property, so, also, it should be granted to him whose property has become deteriorated on account of the jetsam. Papirius Fronto also stated this in an opinion.

5. Hermogeniamis, Epitomes of Law, Book II.

The contribution of those who saved their merchandise from shipwreck does not indemnify anyone for the loss of the vessel; for it is held that the equity of this contribution is only admitted when, by the remedy of jetsam, during the common danger, the interest of the others is consulted, and the ship is saved.

(1) If the mast is cut away in order that the ship with its merchandise may be freed from danger, there will be an equitable claim for contribution.

6. Julianus, Digest, Book LXXXVI.

A ship beaten by a storm and with her rigging, mast, and yards burned by lightning, was carried into Hippo. Having been provided while there with a hasty and temporary equipment, she sailed for Ostia, and discharged her cargo uninjured. The question was asked whether those to whom the cargo belonged were obliged to contribute to the master of the ship in proportion to the loss? The answer was that they were not obliged to do so, as the expense was incurred rather for the purpose of equipping the ship, than to preserve the cargo.

7. Paulus, Epitomes of the Digest of Alfenus, Book III.

Where a ship is sunk or stranded, the opinion was given that whatever each one saves out of his own property he can keep for himself, just as in case of fire.

8. Julianus, On Minicius, Book II.

Those who throw any property overboard for the purpose of lightening a ship, do not intend to consider it as abandoned; since if they should find it they can carry it away, and if they have any idea of the place where it has been cast by the sea, they can claim it; so that they are in the same condition as anyone who oppressed by a burden throws it down on the road, expecting to return presently with others and remove it.

9. Volusius Mæcianus, On the Rhodian Law.

A petition of Eudaimon of Nicomedia to the Emperor Antoninus; "Lord Emperor Antoninus, having been shipwrecked in Icaria we have been robbed by farmers of the revenue inhabiting the Cyclades Islands." Antoninus answered Eudaimon as follows: "I am, indeed, the Lord of the World, but the Law is the Lord of the sea; and this affair must be decided by the Rhodian law adopted with reference to maritime questions, provided no enactment of ours is opposed to it." The Divine Augustus established the same rule.

10. Labeo, Epitomes of the Probabilities of Paulus, Book I.

If you have made a contract for the transportation of slaves, freight is not due to you for a slave who died on the ship. Paulus says that, in fact, the question is what was agreed upon, whether freight was to be paid for those who were loaded on the ship, or only for those who were carried to their destination? And if this cannot be established, it will be enough for the master of the ship to prove that the slave was placed on board.

(1) If you hired a ship on condition that your merchandise was to be transported by her, and the master of the ship, without being compelled by necessity, placed your property on an inferior vessel, being aware that you did not wish this to be done; and your merchandise was lost, together with the ship in which it was last transported, you will be entitled to an action on the contract of leasing and hiring against the master of the first ship.

Paulus, on the other hand, says that this is not true, provided both ships were lost on the voyage, since it occurred without the malice or negligence of the sailors. The rule is the same if the first master, having been detained by public authority, was prevented from sailing with your merchandise. This rule is also applicable if he entered into a contract with you under the condition that he would pay you a certain penalty if he did not, by a day agreed upon, land your goods in a place to which he had agreed to transport them, and he was not to blame if he did not wait; even though the penalty was remitted to him. We must observe the same rule in a similar imaginary case, where it is proved that the master, having been prevented by illness, was unable to sail, if his ship became unfit for navigation without any malicious intent or negligence of his.

(2) If you hire a ship capable of transporting two thousand jars and place jars on board, you are liable for the freight of two thousand jars. Paulus says that the fact is, if you hire the entire capacity of the ship, the freight for two thousand jars will be due, but if the freight was agreed upon according to the number of jars placed on board, the contrary rule will apply; for you owe for the transportation of as many jars as you placed on board.

If someone hosts someone, known or unknown, for two nights, he can consider him a guest, because if that one commits an offense, he shall not incur damages for that man. But if he who had been injured makes a report to the justice about him, that the offense was committed by his counsel, he will expurgate himself from plan and deed, if he can, by oath with two of his law-worthy neighbors. But if not,83 he shall pay in compensation the damage and the monetary penalty. But if he provides hospitality for a third night, and that man wrongs someone, he shall hold him to right as if one of his own household because, as the English say, tuo niht gest, pridde niht open hine.84 And if he can not hold him to right, he will have a term of a month and a day. And if he can find him, the evildoer himself shall restore the damage that he caused and the penalty if he is able, [and] also of the body if to this he is forfeit. And if the evildoer cannot restore the damage that he caused, the host who had given him hospitality will make restoration and [pay] the monetary penalty. And if the justice holds him suspect, he will clear himself according to the judgment of the hundred or shire.85

> IV. CONCERNING Wrecks of the Sea, it is agreed, That where a Man, a Dog, or a Cat escape quick out of the Ship, that such Ship nor Barge, nor any thing within them, shall be adjudged Wreck; but the
Goods shall be saved and kept by view of the Sheriff, Coroner, or the King's Bailiff, and delivered into the hands of such as are of the Town where the Goods were found; so that if any sue for those Goods, and (after prove'] that they were his, or perished in his keeping, within a Year and a Day, they shall be restored to him without delay; and if not, they shall remain to the King, and
be seised by the [Sheriffs, Coroners, and Bailiffs,'] and shall be delivered to them of the Town, which shall answer before the Justices of the Wreck belonging to the King; And where Wreck belongeth to another than to the King, he shall have it in like manner. And he that otherwise doth, and thereof be attainted, shall be awarded to Prison, and make Fine at the King's Will, and shall yield Damages also. And if a Bailiff do it [and it be disallowed by the Lord,') and the Lord (will not pretend any Title thereunto,] the Bailiff shall answer, if he have whereof; and if he have not whereof,the Lord shall deliver his Bailiff's Body to the King.

The Rules (Rolls) of Oleron (circa 1266) (laws of the sea of Oleron)
laws drafted by the French government
"Laws" carried by the ship and its cargo, cf local time, Northern European coastal waters
Many of the rules seek to "protect" the goods as property of their owners / merchants.

Wrecking - oleron
Article XXV
If a ship or other vessel arriving at any place, and making in towards a port or harbor, set out her flag, or give any other sign to have a pilot come aboard, or a boat to tow her into the harbor, the wind or tide being contrary, and a contract be made for piloting the said vessel into the said harbor accordingly; but by reason of an unreasonable and accursed custom, in some places, that the third or fourth part of the ships that are lost, shall accrue to the lord of the place where such sad casualties happen, as also the like proportion to the salvors, and only the remainder to the master, merchant and mariners: the persons contracting for the pilotage of the said vessel, to ingratiate themselves with their lords, and to gain to themselves a part of the ship and lading, do like faithless and treacherous villains, sometimes even willingly, and out of design to ruin ship and goods, guide and bring her upon the rocks, and then feigning to aid, help and assist, the now distressed mariners, are the first in dismembering and pulling the ship to pieces; purloining and carrying away the lading thereof contrary to all reason and good conscience: and afterwards that they may be the more welcome to their lord, do with all speed post to his house with the sad narrative of this unhappy disaster; whereupon the said lord, with his retinue appearing at the places, takes his share; the salvors theirs; and what remains the merchant and mariners may have. But seeing this is contrary to the law of God, our edict and determination is, that notwithstanding any law or custom to the contrary, it is said and ordained, the said lord of that place, salvors, and all others that take away any of the said goods, shall be accursed and excommunicated, and punished as robbers and thieves, as formerly hath been declared. But all false and treacherous pilots shall be condemned to suffer a most rigorous and unmerciful death; and high gibbets shall be erected for them in the same place, or as high as conveniently may be, where they so guided and brought any ship or vessel to ruin as aforesaid, and thereon these accursed pilots are with ignominy and much shame to end their days; which said gibbets are to abide and remain to succeeding ages on that place, as a visible caution to other ships that shall afterwards sail thereby.
Article XXVI
If the lord of any place be so barbarous, as not only to permit such inhuman people, but also to maintain and assist them in such villainies, that he may have a share in such wrecks, the said lord shall be apprehended, and all his goods confiscated and sold, in order to make restitution to such as of right it appertaineth; and himself to be fastened to a post or stake in the midst of his own mansion house, which being fired at the four corners, all shall be burnt together, the walls thereof shall be demolished, the stones pulled down, and the place converted into a market place for the sale only of hogs and swine to all posterity.
Article XXIX
If any ship or other vessel sailing to and fro, and coasting the seas, as well in the way of merchandizing, as upon the fishing account, happen by some misfortune through the violence of the weather to strike herself against the rocks, whereby she becomes so bruised and broken, that there she perishes, upon what coasts, country or dominion soever; and the master, mariners, merchant or merchants, or any one of these escape and come safe to land; in this case the lord of that place or country, where such misfortune shall happen, ought not to let, hinder, or oppose such as have so escaped, or such to whom the said ship or vessel, and her lading belong, in using their utmost endeavors for the preservation of as much thereof as may possibly be saved. But on the contrary, the lord of that place or country, by his own interest, and by those under his power and jurisdiction, ought to be aiding and assisting to the said distressed merchants or mariners, in saving their shipwrecked goods, and that without the least embezzlement, or taking any part thereof from the right owners; but, however, there may be a remuneration or consideration for salvage to such as take pains therein, according to right reason, a good conscience, and as justice shall appoint; notwithstanding what promises may in that case have been made to the salvors by such distressed merchants and mariners, as is declared in the fourth article of these laws; and in case any shall act contrary hereunto, or take any part of the said goods from the said poor, distressed, ruined, undone, shipwrecked persons, against their wills, and without their consent, they shall be declared to be excommunicated by the church, and ought to receive the punishment of thieves; except speedy restitution be made by them: nor is there any custom or statute whatsoever, that can protect them against the aforesaid penalties, as is said in the 26th article of these laws.
Article XLVI
If any ship, or other vessel, by any casualty or misfortune happens to be wrecked and perish, in that case, the pieces of the hulk of the vessel, as well as the lading thereof, ought to be reserved and kept in safety for them to whom it belonged before such disaster happened, notwithstanding any custom to the contrary. And all takers, partakers, or consenters of, or to the said wreck, if they be bishops, prelates or clerks, they shall be deposed and deprived of their benefices respectively; and if they be laymen they shall incur the penalties aforesaid. De his autem quos diripuisse probatum sit, praesides ut de latronibus, gravem sententiam dicere convenit. l. ne quid. l. quo Naufrag. D. Incendio, ruina, & naufragio. l navigia, C. furtis. The penalties aforesaid are in the 25th, 26th and 29th articles.
Article XLVII
This is to be understood only when the said ship or vessel so wrecked, did not exercise the trade of pillaging, and when the mariners thereof were not pirates, sea-rovers, or enemies to our holy Catholic faith; but if they are found to be either the one or the other, every man may then deal with such as with rogues, and despoil them of their goods without any punishment for so doing.



Shipwreck - Oleron
Article XXX
If a ship or other vessel entering into harbor, happens by misfortune to be broken and perish, and the master, mariners and merchants, which were on board her, be all drowned; and if the goods thereof be driven ashore, or remain floating on the sea, without being sought after by those to whom they belong, they being ignorant of this said disaster, and knowing nothing thereof in this most lamentable case, the lord of that place or country ought to send persons to save the said goods, which he ought to secure and to put into safe custody; and give the relations of the deceased persons who were drowned, notice of it, and to satisfy for the salvage thereof, not out of his own purse, but of the goods saved, according to the hazards run, and the pains taken therein; and what remains must be kept in safe custody for one year or more; and if in that time they to whom the said goods appertain, do not appear and claim the same, and the said year be fully expired, he may publicly sell and dispose thereof to such as will give most, and with the monies proceeding of the sale thereof, he ought to give among the poor, and for portions to poor maids, and other charitable uses, according to reason and good conscience. But if he assumes the said goods either in whole or in part unto himself, he shall incur the curse and malediction of our mother the holy church, with the aforesaid pains and penalties, without ever obtaining remission, unless he make satisfaction.
Article XXXI
If a ship or other vessel happens to be lost by striking on some shore, and the mariners thinking to save their lives, reach the shore, in hope of help, and instead thereof it happens, as it often does, that in many places they meet with people more barbarous, cruel, and inhuman than mad dogs, who to gain their monies, apparel, and other goods, do sometimes murder and destroy these poor distressed seamen; in this case, the lord of that country ought to execute justice on such wretches, to punish them as well corporally as pecuniarily, to plunge them in the sea till they be half dead, and then to have them drawn forth out of the sea, and stoned to death.

?Flotsom and jetsam?
Article XXXII - oleron
If by reason of tempestuous weather, it be thought expedient, for the lightening of any ship or vessel at sea, or riding at anchor in any road, to cast part of the lading overboard, and it be done accordingly for the common safety, though the said goods so ejected, and cast over-board, do become his that can first possess himself thereof, and carry them away: nevertheless, it is here to be further understood, that this holds true only in such cases, as when the master, merchant, and mariners have so ejected or cast out the said goods, as that they give over all hope or desire of ever recovering them again, and so leave them as things utterly lost and given over by them, without ever making any enquiry or pursuit after them: in which case only the first occupant becomes the lawful proprietor thereof.
Article XXXIII
If a ship, or any other vessel, hath cast overboard several goods or merchandises, which are in chests well locked and made fast; or books well clasped and shut close, that they may not be damnified by salt water; in such cases it is to be presumed, that they who did cast such goods overboard, do still retain an intention, hope, and desire of recovering the same: for which reason, such as shall happen to find such things, are obliged to make restitution thereof to him who shall make a due enquiry after them; or put them to pious uses, according to his conscience and the advice of some prudent neighbor.
Article VIII
If a vessel be laden to sail from Bordeaux to Caen, or any other place, and it happens that a storm overtakes her at sea, so violent, that she cannot escape without casting some of the cargo overboard for lightening the vessel, and preserving the rest of the lading, as well as the vessel itself then the master ought to say, Gentlemen, We must throw part of the goods overboard; and, if there are no merchants to answer him, or if those that are there approve of what he says by their silence, then the master may do as he thinks fit; and if the merchants are not pleased with his throwing over any part of the merchandise, and forbid him, yet the master ought not to forbear casting out so many of the goods as he shall see to be for the common good and safety; he and the third part of his mariners making oath on the Holy Evangel-ists, when they arrive at their port of discharge, that he did it only for the preservation of the vessel, and the rest of the lading that remains yet in her. And the wines, or other goods, that were cast overboard, ought to be valued or prized according to the just value of the other goods that arrive in safety. And when these shall be sold, the price or value thereof ought to be divided livre a livre among the merchants. The master may compute the damage his vessel has sustained, or reckon the freight of the goods thrown overboard at his own choice. If the master does not make it appear that he and his men did the part of able seamen, then neither he nor they shall have any thing. The mariners also ought to have one tun free, and another divided by cast of the dice, according as it shall happen, and the merchants in this case may lawfully put the master to his oath.
Article XLIII
In all other things found by the sea side, which have formerly been in the possession of some one or other, as wines, oil, and other merchandize, although they have been cast overboard, and left by the merchants, and so ought to appertain to him that first finds the same; yet herein also the custom of the country is to be observed as well as in the case of fish. But if there be a presumption that these were the goods of some ship that perished, then neither the said lord, nor finder thereof, shall take any, to convert any part of it to their own use; but as has been said, distribute the money it produces amongst the poor and needy.
Article XXXIV
If any man happens to find any thing in the sea, or in the sand on the shore, in floods or in rivers, if it be precious stones, fishes, or any treasure of the sea, which never belonged to any man in point of property, it belongs to the first finder.
Article XXXVI
If any going along the sea-shore to fish, or otherwise, happens to find gold or silver, he shall be bound to make restitution thereof, deducting for his own pains; or if he be poor he may keep it to himself that is, if he knows not to whom to restore it; yet he shall give notice of the place where he found it, to the neighborhood and parts next adjacent, and advise with his superiors, who ought to weigh and take into consideration the property of the finder, and then to give him such advice as is consonant to good conscience.

BLESSED MARY
ALTERNATIVE NAME: 	SAINTE MARIE, ST MARY
1313 wreck of French cargo vessel which stranded in Chale Bay en route from Tonnay-Charente and Bayonne to England and/or Picardie with wine. Constructed of wood, she was a sailing vessel. This is the vessel which inspired the building of St. Catherine's Oratory, the so-called "Pepper Pot" lighthouse (459794), as restitution for the wine taken by local inhabitants from the wreck.

Carried 174 tuns of white wine belonging to the Duchy of Aquitaine, Regimus de Depe, owner. Ship lost on the Sunday after Easter, with many survivors. Many casks of wine removed from the beach by local men. Complaint by the merchants, viz Elie Byger, Frederick Campanare and Bernard Columers, all of Gascony, resulted in the case being the first heard at Southampton on 8-JUN-1313. It was claimed that 154 tuns had reached the Isle of Wight beaches, of which much was stolen, the loss to the merchants being £1,000. There was also some action taken concerning the wreck and Sir Goditon and the pepper-box lighthouse on the Isle of Wight. Quarr Abbey account names the ship as the BLESSED MARY. (1)
A ballad reads: '...she carried in her hold a delicious wine... white wine it was, the finest, and what's more, there were one hundred tuns and seventy four. Now soon, as water crashed upon her deck, the brave ST MARY was a total wreck.' (Ballads of the Isle of Wight) (1)
In 1313 occurred the most famous of the island's medieval wrecks, the ST MARY of Bayonne. The ship of the BLESSED MARY was sailing from Bayonne in Gascony with a cargo of 174 barrels of white wine from the Duchy of Aquitaine. She was bound for Picardy, where the wine would be delivered to the monastery of Livers. However, the MARY was blown off course, far to the north, and on the 22-APR-1313 she was driven ashore in Chale Bay, in the remote and wild wastes of the 'Back of Wight'. (2)
On the Sunday after Easter 1313, which was 22nd April, a wreck occurred under Chale. It was a ship from Bayonne, called the ship of BLESSED MARY, which had been loaded at Tonnay, on the Charente in Aquitaine, with a cargo of 174 barrels of white wine. There were many survivors, but most of the casks of wine were removed from beaches by local men. As the owners Elie Byger, Frederick Campanare and Bernard Columers were from Gascony, the King wished justice to be done to the complaint, especially as they were his subjects at that date. The case was first heard at Southampton 8th June 1313, then Winchester 20th July 1313 and finally restitution and damages were finally settled at the court held on Wednesday in the first week of Lent, 22nd February 1314. (3)
Walter de Goditon and his cronies, when standing before a jury in Southampton on 8th June 1313, had audaciously removed some 57 casks of white wine from the SAINTE MARIE after she had been wrecked in Chale Bay. (4)
'1313. June 8, Westminster. The like to Thomas de Warblinton, John de Grimestede and John le Flemyng, on complaint by Elias Biger, Frederick Campanare and Bernard de Columers, merchants of the duchy [of Aquitaine], who had laden a ship, the ST MARY of Bayonne, with 174 tuns of white wine at Tonnay, upon the River Charrante, in Poitou, for export to England, and whose ship was wrecked on the Isle of Wyght, and the wine was cast ashore at divers places in the island, that divers men of the county of Southampton seized and carried away the wine, although it was not wreck of sea, as many of the mariners of the ship had escaped alive to the land. Witness: J Bishop of Bath and Wells. By the Bishop of Worcester.' (5)
'1313. July 24. Westminster. Association of John Randolf with Thomas de Warblinton, John de Grymstede, and John le Flemyng in a commission of oyer and terminer issued touching a complaint by Elias Biger, Frederick Campanare, and Bernard de Columers, merchants of the duchy [of Aquitaine]. They had freighted a ship called the ST MARY of Bayonne with 174 tuns of white wine at the town of Tormay [sic] on the river Charrante in Poitou for conveyance to England, and on the voyage the ship was driven ashore on the coast of the Isle of Wight, where the wine was seized as wreck of sea by divers men of the county of Southampton, notwithstanding that many of the mariners escaped alive to land.' (6)
'1314, May 26, Newcastle-upon-Tyne. The like [commission of oyer and terminer] to Master John de Everesdon and John de Westecote, on complaint by John Besecu that, whereas a ship of Remigius de Depe, merchant of Bayonne, freighted with white wines in the duchy [of Aquitaine] to be carried to the ports fo Flanders by the said Remigius de Depe and his men, was driven ashore by tempest near Chale in the Isle of Wight and wrecked, by which a great part of the wine was endangered, and the said Remigius de Depe proved that the ship and wines were his, and afterwards obtained that proof and made his profit therein, Robert de Harslade, John le Walshe and Reymund Arnald having made a plot to injure him, and conspired with certain others at Newport in the same island that Elias Byger, Fretheric de Campane and Bernard de Columiners, unknown men, should lay claim to the ship and wines, and that the said John Besecu should be indicted of having committed a theft of these wines from them, as if those wines had been their property when they were not, and as if Remigius de Depe had not proved that the ship and wines were his, procured his capture and detention for a long time in prison at Winchester until according to the law and custom of the realm he was acquitte: the justices are to enquire fully into these allegations by oath of good men of the county of Southampton. By fine of 40s.' (7)
NB: There is a record for a French cargo vessel which was reported in the Privy Council Papers in 1314 as stranded in Chale Bay, en route from Bayonne to Flanders with wine. Enough of the details are consistent with the ST MARY to suspect that this may be an alternative account of the same vessel, particularly as wrecks tend to turn up in State Papers several months or even years after the initial incident, and this would appear to sound close to the account in source (6). Alternatively, there may be two wrecks in question, the ST MARY, which was definitively bound for England, according to source (5), and the other vessel bound for Flanders. Byger, Campan[ar]e and Colum[in]ers appear to have been involved in the former, (5) and appear as fraudulent claimants in the latter (7). It is therefore possible that these may be one and the same wreck, but it is also possible that if they had not obtained restitution for their wreck, they instead claimed a stake in another wreck nearby. (8)
Ship owner: Regimus de Depe (1); Remigius de Depe (7)
Cargo owners: Elie Byger or Elias Biger, Frederick Campanare, Bernard Columers, Gascony (1)(3)(5)(6), these appear spelt Elias Byger, Fretheric de Campane and Bernard de Columiners, as fraudulent claimants in (7); Remigius de Depe, rightful claimant (7)

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carisbrooke_Priory
In 1046, William FitzOsbern, kinsman of William the Conqueror, founded Lyre Abbey in Normandy. When William became King of England, FitzOsbern was given charge of the Isle of Wight, and took up residence in Carisbrooke Castle. In the wake of the Norman conquest, FitzObern became one of the great magnates of early Norman England, acquiring extensive lands there, from which he made generous donations to Lyre Abbey.[1] The church of Carisbrooke, and other property, had been granted to the abbey of Lire, probably by William Fitz Osborne, Earl of Hereford around 1067.[2] By the mid-12th century, Lyre Abbey had adopted the Benedictine rule.
Around 1100, Henry I of England made Richard de Redvers, also from Normandy, Lord of the Isle of Wight.[3] His son, Baldwin de Redvers, Earl of Exeter and Lord of the Isle of Wight, gave to the Abbey of Lyre all the churches, tithes, lands, rents and benefits that he held throughout the island. Henry II's confirmation charter to Lyre Abbey specifies its possessions throughout England. The priory of Carisbrooke was founded in 1156 by Baldwin de Redvers, to collect the dues in the Isle of Wight of the parent house in Normandy. The monks of Carisbrooke served the chapels of Newport and Northwood

From the mid-12th century it was a Benedictine house. It was abolished at the French Revolution and the abbey buildings mostly destroyed.

The fairies don’t always need a reason to bestow good fortune, though: a man came across the fairies dancing on the beach at Puckaster Cove on the Isle of Wight.  He joined the dance but, after a while, needed to sit and rest.  He sat down on something like a puffball mushroom which burst under his weight, showering gold dust everywhere.  The faeries gave him some of this before he parted from their company.

The Whit Well - "Legend tells us that pilgrims visited the well for its healing qualities. They arrived by ship in Puckaster Cove and came via the Cripple Path and Ashknowle Lane to the well. Prayers were said while the sick and suffering bathed in and drank of its cooling waters. Then healed or with hope renewed and full of thanks to Our Lady of Whitewell and her good Saint Rhadagunde, they returned to the coast via St, Rhadagunde's Path."

1318 or earlier wreck of Portuguese cargo vessel which stranded at Brighstone en route from Oporto and/or Lisbon to England. Forty-five or fifty local people were accused of stealing her goods, and the court case is documented for nearly 20 years; 1318 is the earliest year for which a complaint has come to light. Constructed of wood, she was a sailing vessel.
Commissission of Oyer and Terminer, where as merchants of Portugal and fellows, that whereas they had laden a ship called the JESUS CHRIST of Portyngall with merchandise for conveyance to England and the ship had been driven ashore on the coast of Brighteston in the Isle of Wight and all on board her had escaped to land whereby the ship and merchandise ought not to be declared wreck of the sea, John, Prior of Caresbrok, John de Presford, John, son of William Gilberd, Robert le Haggere, Robert Stille, Adam Stille of the Isle of Wight; Philip Aubyn, John Gabriel, John de Notlye, 'spicer' etc, took and carried away their goods against their will. (3)
A Portuguese vessel, the ship of JESUS CHRIST, which the merchant Martin de Bek, had freighted with goods for England, was driven ashore by storm at Brighstone. The merchant complained, 1 July 1336, that it was not a wreck, for all the crew came safely ashore with their goods, but a considerable number of men came and carried off these goods. In the long list of some 45 men we find many islanders who ought to have known better, among whom was Walter de Goditon. The list includes men from Christchurch, Lymington, Milford and Portsmouth. (4)
Source (3) states the date of loss as 01-JUL-1336, which, in fact, is the last date recorded in the Patent Rolls for a legal action which appears to have continued for nearly 20 years, and the date has accordingly been corrected to a reporting date of 22-NOV-1318.
Additionally, a vessel is said to have been lost in Brooke Bay at Hanover Point, in 1320 [q.v.]. This lies very close to Brighstone and may be a variant account of the JESUS CHRIST; a variant account of the ST MARY [q.v.], also lost 1320; or a separate wreck in its own right. Any of these could have been lost earlier than 1320 or the confusion could have arisen at a later date.

http://tudoraccidents.history.ox.ac.uk/?page_id=177 June 2019. Rock samphire is a succulent coastal plant, nutritious to eat but dangerous to harvest. In Shakespeare’s King Lear, Edgar and Gloucester look down from a cliff and spot ‘one that gathers samphire, dreadful trade’. John Pantridge was practising that trade at Freshwater on the Isle of Wight on 18 June 1576 at a place on the cliffs called ‘peppers mede’, perhaps near Old Pepper Rock. He fell 170 feet onto the rocks below and broke his neck. One month later, on 20 July, the same fleshy, spicy treat lured John Turle to his doom at Fairlight, Sussex. He fell only 13 feet, but it was enough to break ‘his hed and scull’. And women as well as men braved the coast for samphire. At Weston-super-Mare in Somerset on 27 May 1587, Joan Davys fell on a rock and broke her neck when gathering ‘Sampyer’.

In English law, oyer and terminer (/ˈɔɪ.ər ... ˈtɜːrmɪnər/; a partial translation of the Anglo-French oyer et terminer, which literally means "to hear and to determine"[1]) was the Law French name for one of the commissions by which a judge of assize sat. The commission was also known by the Law Latin name audiendo et terminando, and the Old English-derived term soc and sac.
