# Tales of the Press Gang

Whenever I try to find tales of the sea, I struggle somewhat. This is a perfect example of one of the ways I've ended distracting myself with when setting out to find sea stories: a quick pivot instead to look for a nautical account that might lead to a possible story, and then a descent down a rabbit hole / rat hole into something that is only loosely naval. In this case, historical reports relating to *The Press*, aka the press-gang (or pressgang ) and the practice of *impressment*.

Let's start with an example of how appreciated the press-gang weren't:

Hampshire Chronicle - Monday 05 June 1815

About six o'clock on Wednesday evening, as the Officers of the Impress at Hull were attempting to take a seaman, by great exertion he extricated himself from their hold ; during the struggle a mob had collected together, and the press-gang were annoyed for a considerable time by them. After this, the mob assailed the house of rendezvous, the sign of the Spurn Lights, South-end; not satisfied with breaking all the windows and doors, and pulling down part of the front wall, they proceeded into the house, and destroyed all the furniture, linen, glass, &c. the beds they tore open, and strewed the feathers the street; the liquors and ale they drank or carried away pitchers.

```

When another mob remonstrated against the press in Bristo, there was a tragic result when a body of marines saw fit to retaliate by firing their weapons:

Gloucester Journal - Monday 04 April 1803

A very hot press took place took on Saturday night, at Bristol. The press-gangs were uncommonly numerous, and attended by some of the military. At many of the avenues of that city, parties of the military were stationed, to prevent any escape. Upwards of 200 men were picked up; many of whom, not being seamen, have been discharged.

On Sunday afternoon, as the gang and a party of the marines were conducting some of the pressed men to Lamplightr's-hall, in order to put them on board his Majesty's frigate in King-road, they were violently assaulted in the Hotwell-road by large mob, who, not content with using the most opprobrious and irritating language, pelted them with mud, stones, glass bottles, both whole and broken, as greatly to endanger their lives. The officers, both naval and military, repeatedly conjured the thoughtless multitude to desist and disperse, but without effect ; till at length, the marines, whose extreme forbearance had excited the astonishment and admiration of the spectators, irritated beyond further sufferance, without orders from their commanders, fired, as it were involurtarily, among the crowd, by which one boy was unhappily killed, and two or three other persons wounded. A Coroner’s Jury were convened ; from the strong depositions laid before them the very outrageous conduct of the mob, and particularly the evidence a gentleman who swore that he saw a soldier's hat knocked off his head by stones twice in the space of two minutes, before they fired, they returned the verdict of *Justifiable Homicide*.

The boy who unfortunutely lost his life on this occasion, was a poor helpless lad, labouring not only under great bodily, but mental debility, in consequence of fits; to the attacks of which in the streets, he was so subject,that at the instant he fell, the neighbouring inhabitants, accustomed to see him in those paroxysms disease, concluded he was then labouring under one them, till they saw the blood gushing from the wound. The other persons who were wounded, we are rejoiced state, are in a fair way of recover.

But it wasn't just mobs that took up the cause of pressed men, as the following, rather unfortunate, incident, with black humour potential,  in which a wife harries the press-gang for taking her husband, and with fatal result, dramatically shows,:

Hampshire Chronicle - Monday 16 May 1803

The impress on Saturday, both above and below Bridge, was the hottest that has been for some time—the boats belonging the ships at Deptford were particularly active, and it is supposed they obtained upwards of two hundred men, who were regulated on board the Enterprize till late at night, and sent in the different tenders to the Nore, to be put on board such ships whose crews are not completed.

The impressed men, for whom there was not room on board the Enterprize on Saturday were put into the Tower, and the gates shut, to prevent any of them effecting their escape.

The impress on the River was Sunday continued with the utmost activity.

On Saturday, about two o'clock, a dreadful affray happened at Hungerford-stairs, in consequence of a man of war's boat, in which were a midshipman and a gang of seamen, impressing some watermen at that place. Having pressed several they put ashore to take another, when the wife of the last pressed man clung to her husband, and not being able to separate them, she was conveyed away with him in the boat; some coal heavers returning at this moment to work, immediately assailed the boat with glass bottles, and coals from the lighters, till most of the people within her were desperately wounded, and amongst the others, the unfortunate woman: the midshipman and three of his crew were beaten into the water and the whole had probably perished, had not a barge come at this moment belonging to one of the Insurance Offices, to demand the release of a pressed man belonging to that Office, then in the boat: recovering their man, and finding the situation of the press-gang, they took the boat in tow, and proceeded towards Blackfriar's-bridge : to this place the mob pursued her, and being joined by additional numbers, they insisted upon sinking the boat with her crew but this was successfully resisted by the Master of the Insurance barge, who sailed with them below London-bridge, and put them singly on board their tender. The poor woman is said to have died of her wounds. Three of the gang were taken to an hospital with very little hopes of recovery.

```

At other times, members of the press-gang themselves found themselves subject to the law, as in the following report:

British Press - Thursday 07 April 1803

Last week, as a Lieutenant of a press-gang was in pursuit of two men at Lynn, they eluded him by entering a house, when the former asked a man in the street if he was not a constable, to which he answered in the affirmative, whereupon the Lieutenant charged him in the King's name to aid and assist him in taking the two men. The Constable (who was also a Sheriff's Officer) in return enquired if he was not Lieut. ——, to which he replied that he was ; when the Bailiff told him that he was his prisoner, at the suit of ——, for 40l. and took him away.

```

Other encounters with the law played out in different term, with even more comic potential. For example, here we have a case in which the press-gang impress a constable, and then a High Constable, before a personal acquaintance saved the day:

Hampshire Chronicle - Monday 21 November 1803

The following are the particulars of a very extraordinary outrage committed by a press gang at Margate, on Tuesday se'nnight as related by the parties who were the sufferers:—

About ten o'clock at night, Mr. Lancells, who is grocer and tallow chandler, was going round his premises with a lantern, as was his usual custom, to see every part was safe from the danger of fire, when he heard a voice exclaim, "Who is that fellow with the lantern ?" Mr. Lancells replied, "Who calls me that fellow ?" The Captain instantly ordered his men to seize and take him to the boat. Mr. Lancells informed him that he was a constable, and commanded the Captain in the King's name to keep the peace, and added that he was a tradesman, a housekeeper and in all those capacities exempted from the Impress Act. The only answer was, "D——n his eyes, take him on board." He was then dragged from his own door in the Market-place to the Pier, where he was overtaken Mr. Gore, the High Constable, who is also Captain of the Volunteers. Mr. Gore interposed his authority, with his staff of office in his hand, upon which the Captain ordered his gang to seize Mr. Gore, which was done accordingly, and he was dragged into the boat after Mr. Lancells, where they were detained near two hours in the rain under a guard of sailors, while the pressgang proceeded round the town, and pressed several other persons as little liable to the impress as Mr. Gore or Mr. Lancells. Among the persons impressed was Mr. Brett, the farmer, North Down, near Margate. The Civil Power was at an end; the officers of the law being impressed, Mr. Brett had no one to apply to for protection, bur was obliged to submit to the same violence the other gentlemen had suffered. They were all taken on board the Texel, where Mr. Gore happening to know the pilot, received some civilities. The Captain of the Texel was bed, it being three o'clock in the morning when they reached the ship : but Captain Byng was no sooner informed what had happened, than he invited Mr. Gore and Mr. Lancells to breakfast, and made them every apology for the outrage that had been committed, expressing the deepest concern for their sufferings, and informed that his boat should take them on shore whenever they pleased to depart from the ship. They were accordingly landed at Margate on the evening of the day after they had been impressed.

```

Personal contacts were also used to save several young apprentices from the press, as is demonstrated in this example:

POLICE. MANSION-HOUSE. Thursday four Master tradesmen waited upon the Lord Mayor, and thanked him for the order which his Lordship sent with Mr. Nelson, the Deputy Water-Bailiff, for the liberation of their apprentices, who were impressed on Monday last, as they were going down the river to amuse themselves at Greenwich. In the course of their address, they detailed the particulars of the great trouble and inconvenience which they experienced in the present case ; and insisted, that they being Freemen and Liverymen of London, and their apprentices being bound for the freedom of the city, the latter were not liable to be impressed, and that consequently the conduct of the press-gang, who had so impressed them, was a violation of the rights and privileges of the city of London.

The Lord Mayor answered, that he should be always ready to protect the liberties of the city of London, and commended the Gentlemen for their exertions upon the present occcasion.

Geography also appears to have played a role in denying the activities of the press in the following case, although whether it is to be believed may be another matter!

We are not inciined to give any credit to this statement.

Sometimes, however, the threat of impressment might seem to be considered a useful situation to be in!

PRESS-GANGS.

The scandalous outrages that have been committed by Press-Gangs, call for the immediate interference of the Board ot Admiralty. Custom and State necessity authorise the practice of impressing seamen; buc it never was intended, that persons not accustomed to a sea-faring life, and pursuing useful industry, should be deprived of their liberty, dragged like felons through the streets, beat and cut with hangers, and put on board a tender, merely becuase it pleased a set of ruffians, called a Press-Gang.

At Union-Hall, on Friday, William Wortley deposed, that on the preceding morning, about eleven o'clock, as he was going up Tooler-street, where he had been in the discharge of his duty, he saw several persons standing near the corner of the Bridge-yard, who, from their appearance, he took to be a press-gang. Seeing they had stopped a man, whom he heard them ask for his protection, he stopped for a minute, to see how it would end. A man of the gang came to him; and said, "What business have you here ?" The witness replied, "I certainly have as much right here as you." He was then asked, " If he had, ever been at sea ?" He replied he had been two or three times to Gravesend, for pleasure, but no further. Just upon this, the prisoner in custody, who acted as the officer of the gang, consisting of nine men, came up, and ther man, who had been speakiog to the witness, said, "Here is a volunteer." This Wortley denied, telling him he was a police-officer. This did not satisfy the other; for he seized him bythe collar, and said, "you are a volunteer, and shall go along with us." The witness then putting his hand to his coat pocket to pull out his book, and produce his warrants of appointment, one as a police-offiqer, and the other on the impress service; the prisoner, without further cerenony, pulled his cutlass from under his, coat, and gave Wortley so severe a cut on the head, through his hat, that he had nearly bled to death before the wound was dressed. Before he became quite insensible, he requested that he might be taken to some neighbouring surgeon's, to have his wound dressed ; but this was refused. The men then under the direction of the prisoner, dragged him to Mill Stairs, laid him in their boat, (for he could not sit up) and took him on board the tender, where the surgeon dressed his wound. Several persons deposed to the same effect.

The prisoner is a press-master, who is employed under the Lieutenant who has the charge of the impress fervice, but had not any warrant.

The Magistrate said, that the prisoner had exercised the authority reposed in him in a scandalous and cruel manner. He was immediately ordered to be committed to take his trial for the offence, and the complainant was left to the care of the surgeon.

James Bennet was also ordered to find bail, for having assaulted the boy, and the names of the whole gang were sent to the Admiralty, with an account of their conduct.

General Evening Post - Saturday 16 April 1803

Union Hall—Yesterday one of those atrocious circumstances that in their tendency bring Government and their Officers into disrepute, and which are generally occasioned by the cruel and intemperate conduct of some, and the rapacity and indiscretion of others. Officers and persons under them in the impress service, came on to be heard before Mr. Carpenter Smith and Mr. Fournier, the Sitting Magistrates.

As we do not wish in the smallest degree to irritate the public mind, or prejudge the accused person, we lay a simple narrative of the transaction before our readers.

*William Wortley*, one of the Police Officers attending this Office, was in Tooley-street about 11 o'clock in the forenoon in the execution of his duty; at the corner of the Bridge-yard, he saw several persons standing, whom he conjectured to be a press-gang; on coming up, he found that he was right, as they had just stopt a man, whom they were asking for his proteetion. He (W.) stopt on the kirb ; when a man of the gang came up and shoved him, and a boy into the street, faying, "What business have you here ?" Wortley replied---" I believe I have as much business here as you." Some farther conversation took place, in the course of which the man asked if he had ever been at sea? He said, he had made two or three Gravesend voyages for pleasure, but never farther. Just at this period, Mr. Press-Master, the prisoner, came up ; when the man in question said, " Here's a volunteer." Wortley denied this, said he was a Police Officer, and would produce his warrant; this would not satisfy the Officer, as he called himfelf ; but he collared him; and on Wortley's putting his hand back to take his book out of his pocket to produce his warrant of appointment, drew from under his coat a cutlass, with which he struck him so violent a blow on the head as to cut through his hat to the length of four inches in the front slantwise toward the right temple; his head was cut to the length of two inches and upwards, and of so great a depth as to render it astonishing that the unfortunate man survived long enough to be taken on board the tender, and have his wounds dressed. In vain did the poor man beg he might be allowed to go to a Surgeon in the neighbourhood to have his head dressed. In vain did some of the most respectable of the neighbours state that he was a Police Officer, to their knowledge, and that it surely must be improper to take him in the shocking state he was in, when they could not keep him. This was replied to, by a drawn cutlass being flourished at them, with a declaration, that if they interfered with him he would serve them the same as he did him. He was then by the Press-Master's order dragged away from thence to Mill-Stairs, some distance from where the occurrence happened, put on board their galley, laid along (for he was unable to sit up), and c onveyed to the tender, where the surgeon dressed his head, which he declared was so hurt, the material blood vessels being separated, that unless he was extremely careful his life would be endangered.

*Mr. Little*, *Mr. York Hatton*, *Mr. Eamer*, and *Mr. Perkins*, all resident shopkeepers on the spot, and who were present when the business happened, corrobororated the evidence, and deposed as to the cruel and intemperate conduct of the prisoner.

It is scarcely necessary to observe, that in a place like Tooley-street such a transaction just at noon day could not pass unnoticed, and still less that it would pass without exciting the most marked indignation of the populace. Fortunately for the public quiet, Mr. Fournier, the Magistrate arrived and promised the persons present that every proper step should be taken to punish the guilty parties.

As soon as Mr. Fournier arrived at the office, he, with the advice and conjunction of his brother Magistrate, sent to the, Commanding Officer of the tender off the Tower, to send this Press-Master and his gang to the office as prisoners, and release their officer; this was immediately complied with. The Press-Master had *not any Warrant to impress any person*, nor had any person with him. He said, he acted under the verbal orders of his employer, Lieut. Denham, who was not present at the transaction.

Lieut. Denha, being before the Magistrates, was asked to produce his press warrant. He did. On reading it, Mr. Smith observed, that " there was an express direction contained in it, that his power should not be delegated or transferred to any other; and that no proceedings should be had under it, unless he was personally present." Lieut. D. admitted this: only observing, that this person having been a Master's mate, and coming to him very strongly recommended, he thought he might safely entrust him in the execution of the duty; but he denied having given him any directions to go in the streets to impress any passengers—he was not to do so, unless he found them corning or going out of any boat about the stairs by the river side.

The Magistrates, conceiving there was sufficient evidence before them, fully committed the press-master to the county gaol until the prosecutor is out of danger, and his busy assistant until he finds bail.

Oracle and the Daily Advertiser - Monday 27 July 1801

The Master of the Swan Public-house, opposite the India-House, appeared to a summons, calling upon him to answer a complaint of his obstructing the entrance of a peace-officer and a press-gang into his house on Thursday night.

A Constable said, that on accompanying a pressgang to the house, he observed there a number of sailors and some women, seemingly prepared to resist their authority, and that, on account of the obstinacy of the Landlady, they were unable to secure any of the seamen.

The Landlord stated, that having ocasion to rise early the next morning, he went to bed by ten o'clock on Thursday night, soon after which he was disturbed by his daughter coming to inform him that a press-gang had come into the house. He could not believe, her, as he had never before known such a circumstance. On his coming down he found a number of people in his tap-room, and his wife told him she had received a cut on-the arm, and was otherwise much hurt, by a number of people who were strangers to her. He saw a pistol thrust through the windoW, and threats were uttered by the people against any who should oppose them. He then ordered the door to he opened, and demanded to see the warrant, which being shown to him, he told the people they might search where they pleased, adding, that be had no lodgers, and that if the persons in the tap-room had arms, as the Lieutenant had insinuated, it was a circumstance unknown to him. After this statement, the LORD MAYOR dismissed the complaint.

Oracle and the Daily Advertiser - Friday 29 March 1805

SUSSEX ASSIZES. HORSHAM; TUESDAY, MARCH 26, THE KING V. SPRY AND OTHERS.

This was an Indictment against Mr. Spry, a Lieutenant of the Navy, and the Impress Officer at Little Hampton, Duke a seaman, and Wm. Meetin, a farmer, for a riot, assault, and false imprisonment, in pressing two persons from Storrington who were not liable to the Impress Service.

Mr. 'Serjeant SHEPPARD called the particular attention of the Jury to the circumstances of this case, inasmuch, as it involved the most serious consequences to the liberty of all persons in the same class of life with the persons whom he then represented. The Defendant, Spry, was an Officer of the Impress Service, and the case he had to lay before them was that of a wanton abuse of the power which had been intrusted to him for the good and service of his country, into an engine of private revenge and oppression. The poor man who now stood as one of the Prosecutors of this cause, for another of them was dead, both labouring men in husbandry, and one of them Sowten, it was supposed, had given information against some smugglers, particularly against a man of the name of Serle, and in revenge they had caused him to be impressed, although there was no pretence for doing it, according to the laws of the Impress Service, than there was for impressing any man then in Court. He was sorry to add, that from circumstances it appeared, that Lieutenant Spry knew he was aiding in the gratification of this private malice, and not in the fair execution of his duty. For it would be in evidence, that after the pressgang had broken into the poor man's cottage, and carried him and his son away, the Lieutenant was applied to, and told, that the persons he had taken had never been to sea in their lives. But he refused to release them, and directed them to be sent to Portsmouth. It would be proved too, that he said to one of them, that it was as much a theft to take Master Serle's tubs as to steal a sheep from the field, and that the impressed man had been *peeling* against Serle, and was a man of bad character. The Learned Serjeant then animadverted upon the equal security which the law afforded to the lowest as well as to the highest. It threw a hedge and a wall round the poor man's hut, which it was as criminal to destroy or breakthrough without a legal cause, as violating the security of the proudest mansion. The cottager might sleep as safely upon his pallet of straw, as the Peer upon his bed of down. The latch of the cottage door must no more be lifted up hostilely, than the folding doors Of the Palace be rudely burst open. The law resented the violation of both in one equal degree. He paid many encomiums on the naval character, and although his instructions had obliged him to state these charges against a gentleman of that profession, he declared it would give him the greatest pleasure to hear them disproved.

*Mary Sentor* stated, that she was the widow of Senter, and that she had a son by a former marriage, of the name of John Mawley. They lived all together on Storrington Common. On the 27th of February last her husband had gone to bed at eight o'clock, when their cottage was surrounded by eight or ten people, who burst into it. They dragged her son, Mawley, from the chimney corner and handcuffed him. Two of them then went up stairs and brought down her husband, one of them dragged him down by the legs, and another by the hair of his head, and then they handcuffed him also. She saw the prisoner Duke, there, and W. Meetings was another of them. There was also amongst them a man of the name of Trevott, who was not in Court. They dragged her husband down without his clothes, but upon his entreaty they allowed him to dress himself before they handcuffed him. She went to the door, and there stood another man, who told her he was the master of the people in the house, and that he had a pistol, and would shoot her if she made a noise; they next compelled her husband and son to go with them. The next day she heard by a letter where her husband was; she immediately set out to Little Hampton, and found him at the rendezvous house a prisoner, and he was sent from thence to Portsmouth, and did not return for a fortnight and three days. He was then very ill, and she fetched him home from a cart. He died in six days after he got home. She added, he had not been at work for three weeks before he was impressed, having met an accident by having been crushed on the side by a waggon.

*Thomas Broad*, Comptroller of the Customs at Hampton, stated, that Sowten had given information to them a few days before he was pressed, against Serle, and some other reputed smugglers.

Mr. Serjeant SHEPPEILD commented with great force on this evidence, in his reply: and, after a very minute summing up, the Jury found all the Defendant's *guilty*— finding the Lieutenant guilty of the false imprisonment, and not of the assault.

The Judge immediately pronounced sentence, which was a fine of £5O on Lieutenant Spry— three months imprisonment on Duke — and twelve months imprisonment, and a fine of £1OO on Meeton.

Oxford University and City Herald - Saturday 18 February 1809
A sturdy, ragged vagrant, with a venerable full grown beard, lately made his appearance at Lynn in Norfolk. He soon attracted the notice of press-gang, who by a few general questions, discovered that he was, by profession a *prophet*, and had practised ten years. He declared that the war would continue three years longer, and then terminate disastrously. The naval officer doubted the truth of his inspiration, and *pressed* him so strongly to visit a small vessel lying off the coast, that he, at length, reluctantly consented.

Two young men, namced Miller and Brown, who had for some time paid their addresses to a maid-servant in Hatton-garden, London, agreed, with the consent of the fair one, who, it seemed, promised her hand to the victor, to fight for her, and they adjourned to Copenhagen-fields on Friday, to determine the prize. In the interim, notice was sent of their intention to the officer of the tender off the Tower, and towards the close of the battle, when the combatants had severely beaten each other, a press-gang arrived, and carried both the champions off. The fair one has since found consolation for her ioss, in the tender assiduities of a Recruiting Serjeant.

Saint James's Chronicle - Tuesday 30 July 1805

A curious circumstance took place at Brighton on Friday last :— A farmer, who rents the race-ground, having explained to the Jockey Club, that last season he had not received the usual compliment of onefourth of a pipe of wine, threatened to plough up the course if he was not paid what he conceived to be his due. Accordingly, on Friday last he set his plough to work; but a press-gang appearing, the ploughmen fled, and resigned the field to the gentlemen of the turf. The farmer, however, says, he will not be jockeyed out of his wine in this manner, and is determined to have another sort of a race for it in Westminster-Hall.

CAUTION TO PRESS-GANGS.  
LIVERPOOL QUARTER SESSIONS.  
THE KING V. CLEMISON, J. SHIBRIDAN, AND P. CONNOR.

This was an Indictment against the three persons above-mentioned, charging them with riotously and forcibly breaking into the dwelling-house of John Harrison, and of violently beating, wounding, and assaulting him in his own premises.

This Cause excited an unusual interest, and must be considered as of peculiar importance to Maritime places, as it involves the question, Whether a Pressgang, in the exercise of their duty, have a legal right to make forcible entry into a dwelling-house for the purpose of discovering concealed Seamen ?

Mr. PARR opened the case on the part of the prosedition. After some prefatory remarks on the important nature of the duty he had undertaken, and the momentous consequences which the decision of this day might eventualiy involve, he declared it as his opinion, that the right of personal liberty was a privilege of such importance, that without it all other rights are nugatory, and all other human enjoyments entirely valueless; not, he said, that false species of liberty which had spread desolation through the fairest provinces of Europe, and seemed to consist in the right of every than, however depraved, to do as he pleased, but that moderate and measured liberty which submits to the restraints of virtue and the laws, and is compatible with the order and welfare of society. In this country, however, this right to personal liberty admitted of several legal infringements, and among the rest was the practice of impressing seamen for His Majesty's Navy. However much, he said, this practice may be deplored, as repugnant to the genuine feeling of liberty, and hostile to the spirit of the British Constitution, it was now become certain, that without it our maritime superiority could not be maintained, and without that, not one of the blessings we at present enjoy could for a moment be secured.

The good of the whole, therefore, clearly demanded a partial sacrifice. But as this practice, (justified by necessity alone) itself is of itself sufficiently ungrateful to the general feeling, particular care should be taken that it may not be aggravated by unnecessary instances of severity or oppression. In the case before the Court, he maintained that the manner in which the undisputed privilege of His Majesty had been exercised, was illegal, oppressive, and cruel ; and he lamented that the forcible entry into the house of the Prosecutor had been made under the authority of the law, as supposed to have been laid down in a late case at the Lancaster Assizes.  Mr. PARR strenuously combated this dotrine, which, he conceived, could not have been rightly understood ; and denied that there ever existed any law, written or unwritten, which would warrant a press-gang, or any other persons whomsoever, to enter, in the night, or the day, with force of arms, into the peaceful habitation. of any of the meanest of His Majesty's subjects, for the purpose of impressing seamen known to be there concealed; much less, as in the present case, on a bare suspicion. He closed his address with a well-grounded hope, that the verdict of the Jury would be such as was consistent with the justice of the case, and finally conducive to promote the best interests of the country

It was then clearly proved by several Witnesses, that on the night stated in the Indictment the Defendants, with some others, came to the house of the above-named John Harrison, in order to search for a Seaman of the name of Bell, whom they supposed to be there concealed. The door being fastened, they demanded entrance, which being refused, they knocked out the windows, got into the house, and abused the occupier, Harrison, in a shameful manner. They found the seaman, who is now on boarda  Ship of War.

The Defendants did not set up any general defence, but Capt. Cumberland was called on the part of the, Defendant Clemison, to whom he gave a most excellent charaater.

The RECORDER, in a very able and impartial manner, then gave his opinion of the law, in which he acceded to the several propositions before stated; and the Jury pronounced a verdict of Guilty agaimst the Defendants.

True Briton - Saturday 19 November 1803
On the 2nd of August, 1754, about five o'clock in the afternoon, the City of London was greatly alarmed at the sight of two large Birds, which perched themselves on the Cross on the top of St. Paul's Cathedzal ; they were very large, and appeared through a Telescope to be Eagles, though some were of opinion they were Cormorants. However they sat very quietly until a man went up into the gallery and fired a gun at them, on which they flew away. Various were the conjedures of the multitude at this uncommon sight, and some who turn every thing to omens cried, " see, see, how the Spaniards fly away at the firing of a gun—nothing else will bring the Dons to reason." This being observed to have such an effect to draw so numerous a multitude of people together, and the necessities of the State requiring the Fleet to be suddenly manned, the Press-gang placed two live *Turkies* on the top of the Monument, which presently attracted a prodigious number of gazers and a great many useful as well as idle fellows were presently picked Up for the service of the Fleet.

Saint James's Chronicle - Tuesday 20 September 1808
Yesterday, a young man, who was in the service of a Gentleman in Upper Spring-street, New Road, was pressed by a press gang, and taken from his master's house a considerable way down the street. Being alarmed at the sudden change of his situation, he cried out murder, which caused an immense mob to collect. They soon opened the coach, and set the person at liberty; then they attacked the gang, who endeavoured to fly in every direction. Two of them being closely pursued, they took refuge in the shop of Messrs. marshal and Laurence, butchers, in Durweston-street. The mob several times threatened to destroy the house; but a party of the Life Guards came, and escorted the refugees to their guard-house in Marylebone.

The Day - Friday 17 November 1809

THE KING V. ELIZABETH STONEFIELD. The Attorney-General moved the judgment of the court on the defendant, who had been tried on an indictment for enticing a soldier in his Majesty's service to desert. Another count was for *endeavouring* to entice to desert, of which alone she was convicted. It appeared from the affidavits, that on the 4th of February last, the defendant invited this soldier into her house, a public house used for lodgings to sailors, at Liverpool. She asked if he would go to sea, offered him a bounty of 5l. but he refused to go, saying he could not go, for that he was a soldier; he consented, however, to hide himself from his serjeant in a cock-loft with some sailors, who concealed themselves from a press-gang, and where he was afterwards found. It appeared that the defendant wanted this soldier to go to sea, as a substitute for her own son; that she had four sons, all of them at sea in the King's service; that the fifth had been lately impressed, and she wanted his help to carry on her business at this public house in Liverpool; that she is extremely indigent, living partly by the half pay of two of her sons, who had assigned it to her; but she had lost a part of that, on account of, the ship in which one of her sons was, having been wrecked on the Coast of France, where he is now a prisoner.

Mr. *Rein* made an able speech for the defendant, in mitigation of punishment. He spoke of her sex—her age 66—of her extreme indigence— of her affection for the only remaining of her five sons, torn from her bosom in her old age, and recommended her to that mercy which the Court could shew her, consistently with the rules of Justice.

The *Attorney-General* for the prosecution observed, that no advocate could do more than his Learned Friend had done for his client in this case; but it was one in which his public duty called upon him not to relax into a dangerous compassion, for this was a practice which was very injurious to the service; there were no less than fourteen deserters from one regiment, who had gone to sea by this method, by which they got two bounties for one service, and it was impossible to find them. The Court observed, that no discretion was left to the Judges in this case, it depended on the provision of an Act of Parliament, founded upon another statute, both of which needed much amendment. They must either fine the defendant 40l. or imprison her for any period not more than six, ad not less than three months. To fine this defendant in that sum, would, in effect, be to imprison her for a long period . Indeed, because she would have to remain until the fine be paid, and therfore the sentence of the Court upon her was that she be imprisoned in the common jail at Liverpool for three calendar months, and that she do stand in and upon the pillory for one hour, between the hours of twelve at noon and two in the afternoon, according to the form of the statute in that case. made and provided ; that this be in the market-place of Liverpool,where the offence was committed.

NOTE - SEE ABOVE
*John Holt* was indicted for burglariously breaking into the house of the Duchess Dowager of Chandos, with intent to steal.

Elizabeth Humphries stated, that she was housekeeper to the Duchess Dowager of Chandos, in Grosvenor-square; and that the night on which the prisoner got into the house, she had secured the back-door with a fork, which she had placed over the latch. About four o'clock in the morning she was alarmed by a noise like the cracking of wood, and soon after heard some person coming up stairs. She had placed a bar across her bed-room door, which the prisoner removed, and entered her apartment ; she put the curtains on one side, and saw the prisoner, on which she screamed out " Mr. Burton! Mr. Burton ! (meaning the steward) here is a man." Mr. Burton made the alarm, and the prisoner was taken into custody.

She said he had got into the house by a ladder which led to the back-door where several workmen were employed repairing the premises.

Burton, the house steward, said, he was alarmed by the house-keeper, and ran out into the street, and brought in the watchman. No property was found upon the prisoner, or any thing removed in the house.

The prisoner, in his defence said, that he had been drinking in a public-house, and that a pressgang came in, and to escape being taken by them he ran into the prosecutor's house. Being in liquor he fell asleep, and when he awoke did not know where he was. He denied having any intention to commit a robbery The prisoner's intent to steal not being proved, the Jury pronounced him Not Guilty.

British Press - Tuesday 15 March 1803

On Saturday evening last, a banditti, to the amount of 21, composed of coal-heavers, &c. formed themselves into two parties, with a view to plunder; and under the pretence of being authorised press-gangs, seized between 40 and 50 labourers coming from their pay-tables, in the neighbouthood of Wapping, from whom they extorted about 20l. for their liberation. But in the high career of their success, two real press-gangs coming up, demanded their warrants ; for want of which, every one of those noncommissioned plunderers were sent off to the discharge of more honourable duties in his Majesty's service. Some produced protections, but the regulating captain very justly concluded that nothing could or ought to protect such audacious impostors.

EDINBURGH, JAN. 12. HIGH COURT OF JUSTICIARY.

TUESDAY came on before this Court, the trial of *John Herdman*, boatman, in the service of the Customs, Leith, accused of murder, or culpable homicde, by striking Peter Geyler, midshipman, on the Impress ServiCe at Leith, on the head with a bludgeon or stick, nn the evening of the 12th of November last, which occasioned his death in three days thereafter.

The Pannel pled Not Guilty.

No objection was made to the relevancy of the libel by the Pannel's Counsel; and the LORD ADVOCATE restricted the charge to culpable homicide only, as he did not think he could make out the crime of Murder, against the Pannel. The usual Interlocutor was then pronounced, restricting the libel to an arbitrary punishment, and remitting the case to a Jury, which was then chosen.

The first Witness called was Mrs. Calderwood, wife of John Calderwood, meal-dealer in Leith, who said, that she remembers her husband being pressed on Saturday the 12th November, and was taken to the rendezvous, where she went, but afterwards returned to lock her shop door; and went to Coming's, where her husband then was , who had been liberated. Mr. Geyler came in, and said he would have her husband yet, and used him very badly. On the Witness remonstrating with Geyler he struck her ; on which the Pannel, who then came in , said it was a shame to use a woman ill. Herdman put out Geyler, and locked the door– The Witness was also locked out, But afterwards admitted into Coming's, wheN the Pannel went away, and she did not see him again that night—Herdman was sober, but Geyler was mortal drunk that night.

John Calderwood said, he never was at sea, but was pressed from his own door on the 12th November, and carried to the rendezvous, but was relieved in a short time—He then went to Cuming's, where Geyler came, and insisted on taking the Witness again to the rendezvous—His wife interfered with Geyler for using him badly, when Geyler struck her. Herdman, who was present, interfered, and said it was shameful to strike a woman, and at last put out Geyler, who continued for some time swearing at the back of the door. About an hour after, the Witness left Cuming's by a back door.—Herdman was sober, but does not think Geyler was so.

John Beatson, midshipman, on the Impress at Leith, remembers Calderwood being impressed, but was not present when any scuffle happened. After Geyler was put out of Cuming's, he said to the Witness, "D——n that wooden-legged b——r, I'll do for him, for interrupting me on my duty." Herdman almost immediately came out, when Geyler repeated his words, and struck Herdman on the head with a stick he had in his hand. The Pannel took the Witness as evidence of his being struck, and said he would haVe satisfaction. The quarrel continued between Geyler and him along the shore, when Mr. Waddell opened his window, and asked " what was the matter ?" Herdman said he had abused by Geyler, an would have satisfaction. Waddell advised him to let the matter rest that night, and have recourse to the Civil Law. Herdman went back to Calderwood's, and the Witness saw Mrs. Calder wood home, and Herdman went back to Coming's with a stick in his hand.

James Thomson, one of the press-gang, said he saw Geyler strike the Pannel qith a stick, and Herdman took him a witness.

George Alexander, another of the press-gang, said, about eleven o'clock he saw Herdman, and spoke to him. Shortly after Geyler came out of the house, when Herdman struck him on the head, and knocked him down.— That the Witness lifted up Geyler, took him home, and his wife dressed his wound— That he went up the shore again, and met Herdman, who asked him to take a glass. They accordingly went into a public house, when the Pannel told him how hw had been used by Geyler striking him on the head, which raised a large lump on it— That he had gone to Mr. Waddell to complain, who advised him to go home ; but he had gone to the watch house, got a stick, and ,having met Geyler near Coming's, had knocked him down.

Mr. Alexander Waddell, Customs, Leith, said, that on the 12th November, the Pannel called at his house about eleven o'clock, much agitated, and said he had been badly used by Geyler— That he had been struck on the head by Geyler with a stick, and wished the Witness to interfere.—That he asked the Pannel the cause of the quarrel, when he told him he had prevented Geyler from using ill a woman of the name of Calder wood, and said he had gone to Cuming's, where Geyler had knocked him down. The witness advised, the Pannel to say no more, but let the Law take its course. The Pannel then went away ; but in a short time the Witness heard a noise in the street, and went to the window, where he saw the Pannel and another man ; when he asked Herdman if that wasthe man who had struck him, Herdman said it was : on which the Witness again advised him to go home, and he would let Captain Nash know the matter in the morning. Next morning he saw the Pannel, who told him he had given Geyler as good a stroke as he had got. The Pannel has been four years in the service. of the Customs ; and he considered him as a sober man, and a steady officer. He had lost his leg at Teneriffe, along with Lord Nelson.

Mr. Charles Anderson, Surgeon in Leith, said, he was called to see Geyler on the 13th November, and found him insensible. He had a wound on the back part of his head, but it was not a large one. He died on the evening of the 14th, when his head was opened.—There was a great effusion of blood under the bone, which he thinks was the occasion of his death, but which had proceeded from the external wound.

Mr. Kellie, surgeon in Leith, concurred with the preceding Witness; but was of opinion, that if the deceased had not been much intoxicated , the wound could not have occasioned his death.

The Pannel's declaration was then read, which closed the evidence on the part of the Crown.

Three Witnesses were examined to the character of the Pannel, who described him as a humane, decent, sober man, and not at all quarrelsome. Two certificates were also read, one from Captain Hutchinson of the Royal Navy, and another from the Physicians at Haslar Hospital, both of which were greatly in favour of the Prisoner.

The LORD ADVOCATE for the Crown, and Mr. F. JEFFREY for the Pannel, each addressed the Jury in very appropriate speeches. —Lord CRAIG, who presided at the Trial, summed up the whole in a candid and humane charge to the Jury. About a quarter after one, the Jury inclosed in the robing room, and in a short time returned a verdict,, all in one voice finding the Pannel *Not Guilty*. The Pannel was then assoilzied *simpliciter*, and dismissed from the bar.

A striking display of omnipotence of love, occurred at the High Church, Hull, a few days ago. A young woman having given her heart to a sailor, who was impressed and carried on board the tender by the interference of her friends, resolved nevertheless to marry the object of her choice : He was accordingly brought on shore, and escorted by the press-gang to the church, from whence, after the marriage ceremony, he was again conveyed in the tender.

London Courier and Evening Gazette - Saturday 13 April 1805

A whimsical circumstance happened last week off Gravesend. A West Indlaman arrived at that place, and was soon boarded by a press-gang. The crew of the West Indiaman were brought upon deck, and while the Lieutenant was examining them, a health-boat arrived. As no clean bill of health was found on board the West Indiaman, or at least none that was deemed satisfactory, the crew of the West Indiaman, the Lieutenant of the man of war, and all his gang, were ordered to Standgate Creek to perform quarantine for forty days, which they will, no doubt, pass in perfect *harmony* and *good fellowship* with each other.

AN IMPOSTOR.—An apparent cripple in sailor's garb, who lately craved charity about the neighbourhood of Blackfriars Road, seeing a press-gang approaching to examine whether his *hull* was fit for service, threw away his crutches, and ran off, exclaiming— "They may have my *rotten timbers*, but d——n, &c. if I don't make sail, and find my *sea legs*."

ANDREW JONES.

"I hate that Andrew Jones: he'll breed  
"His children to waste and pillage.  
"I wish the press-gang, or the drum  
" With its tantara sound would come  
" And sweep him from the village!"

I said not this, because he loves  
Through the long day to swear and tipple;  
But for the poor dear sake one  
To whom a foul deed he had done,  
A friendless Man, a travelling Cripple.

For this poor crawling helpless wretch  
Some Horseman who was passing by  
A penny on the ground had thrown;  
But the poor Cripple was alone  
And could not stoop —no help was nigh.

Inch-thick the dust lay on the ground,  
For it had loug been droughty weather;  
So with his staff the Cripple wrought  
Among the dust till he had brought  
The halfpennies together.

It chanc'd that Andrew pass'd that way  
Just at the time; and there he found  
The Cripple in the mid-day heat  
Standing alone, and at his feet  
He saw the penny on the ground.  

He stoop'd and took the penny up:  
And when the Cripple uearer drew,  
Quoth Andrew, "Under half-a-crown,  
"What man finds is all his own,  
" And so, my friend, good day to you."

And *hence* I said that Andrew's boys  
Will all train'd to waste and pillage;  
And wish'd the press-gang, or the drum  
With its tantara sound, would come  
And sweep him from the village!
