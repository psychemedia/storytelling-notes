# And the Girl Played On

A set of four tales...

## Love more than salt

*Widely told, this is a variant that has been forming for mem that borrows from several of them...*

Once upon a time, there was a King, who had three daughters. The King didn't know them perhaps as well as he should, so he called them to him to ask them a question: "hwo much do you love me?" When the daughters looked at him a rather confused way, he explained to them: one day, I will choose one of you to succeed me. To love me, is to love my people. Who will be your people. So: how much do you love me?"

The eldest princess, who had perhaps expected to be the chosen one, answered first: "I love you as much as all the gold in the kingdom" she said, and to the King, this was a good answer: being a King was an expensive business and this daughter appeared to have learned that lesson already.

The second princess, who loved to follow the latest fashions, answered: "I love you as much as all the jewels in the kingdom", and this was a pleasing to him too: a King — or Queen — should look the part *and* have a sense of the value of expensive things. And this daughter obviously loved pretty things, so for to love him more than that made him feel good.

The third, and youngest, daughter, looked as much like one of the serving girls as a princess; rather disappointing, really. She thought for a moment and then said: "Father, I love you more than meat loves salt".

And the King spluutered. "What sort of answer is that? You, you spiteful, common girl. Get out of my sight... No, more than that, leave the castle altogether. I don't want to see you again... Get yourself some food from the kitchen, and go..." And with that, he sent her away.

The girl went to the kitchen, and as she asked for a few small provisions from the cooks, she explained her fate; but the cook took pity on her and said "the King never comes down here. You can stay and help me..." And she gave the girl a wink.

It wasn't long after that the day came when the King was to announce who would be his successor. To show the love he had for his people, the banqueting hall would be open to all. And to show them his generosity, he would treat them to a feast the like of which they had never seen before. And to show his humility, the guests would be served first, and the King would be served last.

The banqueting hall was packed; the guests were in their finest rags, ("literally", thought the king), and the mood was expectant: all had heard how splendid the King's feasts were, the finest dining but with the most generous of portions, and they were HUNGRY.

First came the appetisers, then some wine.

Then the soup - not quite what they expected, it tasted a bit bland — then more wine.

Then the feast proper would begin. Platters of the finest meats from the best hunting in the kingdom. Huge platters - roasted pigs, and roast deer. The finest beef, the most succulent lambs. The King looked on and smiled: the people would love him for this.

But instead of the gasps of pleasure, the happy lively chatter as the people admired his generosity, and his good taste, a silence followed the plates - "the poor peasants are dumbfounded, I expect" laughed the King to his wife. "They've probably never tasted anything anything sweeter than a turnip before, and the best meat they'll have ever had is probably rat." As I said, he was showing his humility.

But then, the silence turned to muttering, sidelong glances, people spitting out the food. People spitting out the meat and shaking their heads and... the King called for one of the plates to be brought to him. As he tasted the meat he - erghh - spat it out.. It was tasteless and bland and was not at all what he expected. Not at all what he was accustomed to.

He demanded the cook be dragged before him. The guards were sent out, and soon returned with the cook between them. Following them, unnoticed, a young serving girl, carrying a bag...

As the king demanded an explanation from the cook, the serving girl passed something along each of the tables. Immediately their tone changed, and where the people had been spitting out the meat, now they were feasting hungrily upon it.

"Explain yourself," said the King to the cook, "you're supposed to be the finest cook in the Kingdom? Serving the fiest food. Bute even the peasants are spitting it out."

And as he gestured toward the packed hall, he noticed that the people were now feasting.

He glared at the cook. "What - what have you done to them?" he demanded.

The cook smiled at him. "All that was missing was the salt, sire, for meat loves nothing more than a little salt."

And as the serving girl approached his table, the King recognised her as his daughter.

And he knew who he would announce as his successor.

## Nettle spinner

*This is told with a later callback from Daniel Morden's telling of "the Leaves That Hung But never Grew".*

*Deulin in Lang whichever colour Fairy book...*

ONCE upon a time, there was a great lord, a Count, who everyone called "the Wolf". He had a wicked heart, and a cold steely eye, and it was said that he used to harness his peasants to the plough, and whip them as they tilled his land in their bare naked feet.

But he also had a wife, the Countess. And she was as tender to the poor, as he was cruel.

Every time she heard of her husband's misdeeds, she would secretly repair the harm he had done; and her name was blessed throughout the whole country-side. She was welcomed, as much as he was avoided. She was loved, as much as he was hated.

II

One day, as the Wolf was out hunting in the forest, he came across a cottage. Outside, a young girl was playing.

"What's your name ? " he asked.

And she told him. "Renelde".

" You must be tired of living in such a run down place all by yourself ? "

" I am accustomed to it, sir; and I am not alone: my grandmother looks after me."

" That may be so ; but come to the castle, and I will make you my wife's maid."

But before she could respond, her grandmother had come to the door, and shouted at the Wolf: " get away from here, you know you're not welcome. You just leave her alone". And he rode away.

III

Several years later, the Wolf passed by again.

Renelde was by now turning from the young girl she once was into the woman she would become, and as she gathered eggs from the hens around the small yard, he asked her: " What is your name ?"

And she told him.

" You must be tired of living in such a run down place ? "

" I am accustomed to it, my lord, but I am happy here, with my grandmother."

" That may be so ; but come to the castle, and I shall make you my wife's lady-in-waiting."

But Renelde knew the stories, and she knew better than to go up to the castle.

IV

A few months more passed before the Wolf next returned. Renelde, in the full flush of maidenhood, was sitting outside the cottage, spinning hemp.

" You are Renelde," he said. "Come up to the castle; I shall send away the Countess and make you my wife."

But many years before, as Renelde's mother lay dying, the Countess had shown much kindness, and helped to take away some of her mother's pain. So even if the Wolf really had wished to marry Renelde, she would always have refused.

And besides, the young woman had started courting a young man...

V

It was only a few weeks before the Wolf appeared again, but they had been happy weeks. A lot had happened in those short weeks.

This time, Renelde was spinning flax, not hemp.

" What are you spinning ? " he asked.

And she replied: "My wedding shift, sir, if it pleases you?"

" So you are going to be married, then ? "

" Yes, sir, by your leave."

For at that time, if there was no father in the house, the permission to marry must come from the lord.

" Then I will give you leave to do so... But on one condition. The churchyard is filled with nettles that grow over all the tombs. Go there and gather the nettles, then spin them into two fine shifts. One shall be your bridal shift... and the other shall be my shroud. For you shall only be married on the day that I am laid in my grave." And with that, the Count turned away with a mocking laugh.

VI

Renelde sobbed. Never had she heard of anyone spinning nettles. Rebelde cried: the Count was a strong man, seemingly made of iron, who oftend boasted that he would live to be a hundred.

She went back into the cottage, sobbing and crying. Through her tears, she blurted out what the Wolf had demanded she should do.

Sitting in the corner, her grandmother said: "it is many years since I have heard of anyong spinning nettles... but it used to be done once, and so I am sure it can be done again. "

And sittng next to her, an old, old woman, older than the hills, who had known the girl's mother, and her grandmother's mother, and her grandmother's grandmother before her. She had recently taken to visiting again, sitting in the shadows, or later in the day, in the flickering candlelight, as if she were waiting, waiting for something, nodding her head and rarely saying a word. But now she said something: " he is foolish to make you such a bargain."

That evening, Renelde's young man came to visit, as he did every evening. When Renelde told him what Burchard had said, he was angry, and asked what he should do: " Would you like me to watch for the Wolf, and split his skull with a blow from my axe ? "

"No," replied Renelde, " there must be no blood shed over my bridal gown. And I have told you how good the Countess was to my mother. But maybe, maybe?, if make the broidal shift, that will be enough."

VII

And so Renelde went to pick the nettles from the Churchyard, as the Count had said she must; and to her great surprise the nettles, when crushed and prepared, they gave a good thread: soft, and light, and firm.

And before very long she had spun enough thread to make cloth for the first shift, the shift for her own wedding.

And she wove it and she cut out the pattern, and she hoped that it would be enough.

Just as she had finished sewing it, the Wolf passed by again:

" Well," said he, " how are you getting on? "

" Very well, sir" she replied, and showed him her wedding shift. It was made of the finest cloth, of the whitest cloth, that the Count had ever seen.

Now he had thought such a thing would be impossible, and he grew pale at the sight of it. But he was a proud man, and he replied gruffly, " Very good. Now begin the other."

But just as he had started to ride away, he stopped again, and turned, and said: " this is not right" and the girl thought that he had perhaps changed his mind, that her brdial shift would be enough. But it wasn't: "You should not have to do a task alone. Send your young man up to me at the castle; he also should do something for me...".

VIII

That evening, when Renelde's young man came to visit, as he did every evening, Renelde told him what the Count, what the Wolf, had said.

And so he went up to the Castle.

And when he got there, he was summoned in before the Count.

I will not labour you with the details, but the Count's thinking was this: if he could send the young man away, there would be no wedding. And if there was to be no wedding, there would be no reason for Renelde to make his funeral shift. And so he gave the boy on a quest, to find something for him that could not possibly exist, the details of which I will not bore you with now. And that the boy should leave *NOW*, there was no time to waste: the sooner he left, the sooner he would be back — (ha! or never...) — and the Count would send a message to Renelde to say her young man was running an errand for him.

"Now be about your task before you forget it", he said, and the young man was sent on his way.

IX

The following day, Renelde was sent the news. She had already strated on Berchard's funeral shroud before the messenger had arrived. If Berchard had thought it would stop her from working on his funeral shift, it had the opposite effect.

She worked even harder and faster than she had before. In the castle, a cold shiver passed over the Count when the messenger reported back what he had seen. As the saying goes, it felt almost as if someone was walking over his grave.

He tried to eat his lunch, but he had no appetite ; he tried to warm himself by the fire, but it was as if it burned with a cold, cold flame.

All that day he got worse; he went to bed shaking with fever. But he did not sleep; and in the morning, he could not manage to rise.

This sudden illness, which at every instant became worse, started to torture him as if it were waking nightmare.

No doubt Renelde's spinning-wheel had something to do with this? It was almost as if his body were preparing to dress itself in the shroud she was spinning.

X

So he called to his soldiers, and sent them to break the wheel to stop her spinning.

So the soldiers when to the cottage in the forest, and they broke the wheel into a thousand pieces.

But the next day, the wheel was mended, and Renelde sat down to spin again. As her young man was on his quest, so was she on hers — to finish the second shift.

Again the Count sent his guards, this time to tie her hands, and not lose sight of her for one instant.

But the guards fell asleep, the bonds undid themselves, and the Renelde spun on.

A third time the guards were sent. This time, they seized her, tied her arms and legs together, and a stone to her neck and flung her into the river, its waters swollen by the late rains.  But the ropes untied themselves, and Renelde floated up to the surface, and though she could not swim, she was somehow carried to the land.

As Renelde spun on, he Count had every nettle rooted up for three leagues round. But scarcely had they been torn from the soil when they sowed themselves afresh, and grew even as you were looking at them.

They sprung up even in the well-trodden floor of the cottage, and as fast as they were uprooted the distaff gathered to itself a supply of nettles, crushed, prepared, and ready for spinning.

And every day the Count grew worse, and watched his end approaching.

XI

Moved by pity for her husband, the Countess at last found out the cause of his illness. But even as she entreated him to allow himself to be cured, the Count, in his pride, refused to go back on his demand.

So the Countess resolved to go without his knowledge to pray for mercy from Renelde; in the name of Renelde's dead mother, she beseeched her to stop spinning.

But Renelde was determined: "He said I cannot marry until I have finished his funeral shift,"

"But neither can you marry until your young man returns... So please, stop your spinning until then, at least. For my husband's sake. For my sake. For the memory of your mother. Promise me, please, promise me."

So so Renelde promised her, and stopped her spinning. And waited for one month, for two, for six, for a year. The Wolf begain to recover his health, happy with thought that Renelde's young man would never return, satisfied that he would not have to retract his demand.

XII

One day, at the market, Renelde saw the Count. She clasped her hands as if in prayer, and cried :

" My lord, have mercy ! Tell me where he went..."

But the Wolf just turned his head away, and passed on by.

Renelde might have humbled his pride had she gone back to her spinning-wheel again; but she did nothing of the sort.

When she came back home she looked at the silent spinning wheel in the corner, and cried for three days and three nights, and nothing her grandmother could say, or do, made things any better.

XIII

Another year went by.

When the Count fell ill again, the Countess supposed that Renelde had started to spin again. But when she came to the cottage, angrily knocking at the door and asking "why, why are you spinning again?", she saw the spinning wheel was still, covered in dust and cobwebs in the corner of the room.

The Count grew worse and worse, and the doctors gave up all hope. The passing bell was rung, and the Count lay expecting Death to come for him.

But Death was not so near as the doctors thought, and still the Count lingered.

His condition was desperate: he got neither better nor worse. He could neither live nor die. He suffered horribly, and called loudly on Death to put an end to his misery.

His thoughts turned to Renelde, and the demand he had made of her long ago. If Death was so slow in coming, was it because he had no shroud for his burial?

XIV

He sent for Renelde, thinking not of what he might have done for her, but only of what she might do for him. And as she stood at the foot of his of his bed, he looked at her with a cold flash of fire in his eye, and he ordered her to go on spinning his shroud.

Rendle looked at the Wolf, at the Count.

"I made your wife a promise", she said, "that I would not spin again until my young man has returned". And with that, she turned, and left the room.

And as she lived on in her silent sorrow, the Count lingered on, straddled between the worlds of life and death...

And that is the end of the tale.

## The leaves that hung but never grew

*Based on Daniel Morden's retelling. There is a callback to the Nettle Spinner as the girl leaves the crossroads.*

Once there was a house, a happy house. A house that had known the sound of children playing in the gardens, and of chatter on the terrace.

But now it was known as the weeping house. A dog wept in the yard outside. The birds wept in the gutters.

Inside, the master of the house sat at his table, despairing over the state of his son. Upstairs, a young man sat at the end of his bed, crying for something he could no longer remember.

One day, a young woman walked up the drive. Her hair was matted with twigs and leaves, her clothes were no more than rags. She was barefoot. The dog didn't growl, it just whined into a muddy puddle. The girl knocked on the door, once, twice. She was led in to see the master.

"The people in the village told me that if a young woman could make your son smile, she could marry him. I want to try. And if I fail, [sigh], I don't know what I'll do."

The master said, "You and the rest of them. Many women have come here, many women have tried. They've told him jokes, and funny stories, they've dressed up in funny costumes, they've poked him and tickeld him, they've tried everything. I suppose you have as much right to try as they did. I wish you luck."

A sobbing servant led her upstairs. A young man sat at the end of his bed, his hand clenched into a fist, a bucket between his feet to catch his tears, grooves worn into his cheeks from his continual crying.

The young girl sat beside him, "Why are you crying? What do you have to cry about? What misery do you know? You have a roof over your head. You have food, you have servants. Me, all I have are these rags. I had no father. I have no mother. I have no-one."

Outside, a bell tolled.

"Listen to me", said the girl, "and I will tell you a story. Your father said that funny stories don't help, but this isn't a funny story." And so she began her tale.

Once, there was a young woman called Anwen. She lived with her mother in little old cottage.

They were so poor, they had to share a bed. But even though they were poor, there was always smoke coming out the chimney, there were always hens scratching in the yard outside.

One night, as she slept, Anwen had a dream: she dreamt that she should search until she found the leaves that hung but never grew. "An odd dream", she thought, when she woke up the next morning, but then thought no more of it.

The next night, she had the self-same dream. She mentioned it to her mother.

When the dream occurred again, exactly as it had before, she knew what she must do.

"If your heart is set on traveling", said her mother, "I can't stop you. But listen to me. Sometimes the world is not the way it seems. If you see something you don't understand, wait. Watch before you speak."

Anwen packed a small bag, said goodbye to her mother, and promised to return.

As evening came, the sky went red. Anwen walked towards a small hill. At the bottom of the hill was a cottage. Behind, at the top of the hill, a tree with seven spindly branches. Hanging from each branch, a single leaf.

An old woman came out of the cottage, "Night is coming, and this is no place for one such as you. Come in, come in", and before she knew it, Anwen was bustled inside the old woman's cottage. And a strange cottage it was.

One half of the room was as you might expect: a fire, a table, a comfortable chair; but the other half was a pigsty. Literally. A small gate cornered it off, and there, in the corner, was a wild boar.

As soon as it saw Anwen, it squealed, and scuffed at the ground, and shook the chain around its neck.

The old woman snarled: "Bag of bones, do something right for once. Go and get some water from the well" and a skeletal figure, made of little more than skin and bone, with a complexion as grey as a wintry sky, scurried past. The old woman's daughter. When she returned, she was dragging a cauldron, which slopped water onto the cold stone floor. Her mother chastised her, made as if to hit her, and the girl cowered away.

But if she was harsh towards her daughter, the old woman was politeness itself to Anwen: "Ah, Anwen, I'm sure you're tired after your journey. Please sit down, eat, drink."

So Anwen sat; and she ate, and she drank; and they talked about this, and they talked about that. And as they talked, Anwen was careful. She said nothing about the leaves that hung but never grew. She remembered her mother's advice. She said she was poor and she was seaeking her fortune.

"I don't know about a fortune", said the old woman, "but I do need a bit of help around my cottage. My *stupid daughter* can't bring water from the well without spilling it. So Anwen, if you can sweep the floor, and keep the fire alight, feed the boar each night and bring me a cup of tea in the morning, I'll give you whatever food I can spare.

"And in a few months, when the boar is big, and fat, we'll have a feast. What do you say to that?"

Anwen said she was grateful. She said she was glad to stay. The days turned into weeks. The weeks turned into months. Each morning, she swept the floor and tended the fire. Each night, she fed the boar. And every day, three times a day, the old woman gave her a plate piled high with good things to eat. And each time, insisted that Anwen clear the plate.

For the first time in her life, Anwen found there was flesh on her bones, instead of just skin. But she notice that, if ever Bag of Bones, the daughter of this house, asked for another morsel, another mouthful, her mother would shout at at, and chastise — what are you, eating me out of house and home?! — and would beat her daughter across her back.

It was hard for Anwen to eat when Bag of Bones was across the room, watching her, following every fork full.

Each night, when the house quiet, Anwen would look out at the tree with its seven bony branches, a single, solitary leaf hanging from each one. But she never spoke of them.

It was winter. One evening, the old woman and her daughter were outside in the yard as Anwen was feeding the boar. Anwen spoke her thoughts aloud for the first time. "Whole months have passed by and I'm no closer to finding out if those are the leaves I dreamt of. Oh, what should I do?"

To her astonishment, the boar answered her.

"Ah, you have spoken to me, *at last!*. Now *I* can speak to *you*. I had given up hope that ever you would do so. Come here, listen to me. Those leaves on the tree? They are the leaves you you dreamt of. I too was sent to find them, although, I... I don't remember why. I was a young man then. I searched and I searched until I came to this place. I saw the leaves. I asked the old woman if I could pick them from the tree. But... the boar looked around: she is a witch. She cast a spell on me. She spelled me into a boar. And she's fattening me up. And soon, she'll slit my throat, and cook me, and eat me. And once she's eaten me, guess who'll be next? I can she's already fattening you up. Unless you want to be a sow and take my place in this sty, you must steal those leaves, and flee from this place."

Together, they made a plan.

Later when the old woman and her daughter were fast asleep upstairs, Anwen crept out of the cottage. She went up the hill, to where the bony tree, and from each of the seven spindly branches, she plucked each single solitary leaf that hung from it. As she made her way down the hill, she knew what she must do.

She went back to the cottage, and took the first magic leaf. She tapped the boar with it, and the leaf vanished. The boar became a young man. She had broken the spell. Anwen gasped, but before she could say anything, the young man rushed to the door, and said "hurry, we must escpae before the witch wakes up" — for that's exactly what the old woman was.

But Anwen hesitated. She took the poker from the fire, placed it on the chair, and leant the broom against them both. With the second leaf, she gave them a tap. And when she was done, she fled with the young man, away from the hill and away from the cottage.

As dawn broke, the sky glowed red. The witch woke up, the cottage was quiet. Her morning cup of tea was not there. "Anwen", she called, "where are you?"

Downstairs, the poker replied: "I'm poking the fire."

The witch rolled over, and went back to sleep. Some little time later, the witch woke up again. The cottage was still, and quiet, and her tea was still not there: "Anwen, what are you doing now?"

And the broom replied: "I am sweeping the floor."

The witch rolled over, she fell back to sleep. She woke up for the third time: and still no tea: "Anwen, come here".

And the chair said: "I'm coming now".

But as the witch waited, there was no sign of Anwen. There were no foosteps on the stairs. The old woman waited; and waited, and waited some more. She looked out of the window.

"Aargghhhh...." she screamed. " Bag of Bones, where are you, get up, get up,  the tree is bare: Anwen has discovered our secret. She's stolen the leaves."

She ran down the stairs... Saw the rope, and the collar, empty in the pig sty: "arrghh, she's freed the young man. They're escaping to the forest, that's where I'd go. Get up, get up, and set off after them. Get up, get up, and bring me back whatever you can find".

And so Bag o' Bones pulled on her clothes, and as swift as thought, she set off on the chase, up, and out of the house.

Anwen, and the young man, were running, and running, along the path, through the forest; behind them, they could sense, they could *hear*, the sound of pursuit, getting closer, getting closer...

Anwen reached into her pocket, and took out a leaf. "We can't outrun her", she said, "so we'll hide. We'll change our shapes," and tapping the boy, she said "you: be a pond, and I...? Will be a duck..."

Just in time. Around the corner, came Bag of Bones. The footsteps she'd been following through the woods had ended.

"Little duck! Little duck? did you see a young womanm, and a young man, come by this way."

The duck said nothing, just dipped its head beneath the surface of the water.

Bag o'bones turned round, and went back the way she had come. When she got back home, her mother, the witch, asked: "Well? Did you find them?

And Bog o' Bones replied: "I found nothing. I went into the forest, and followed their footprints; but they stopped at a pond, and on the pond I saw a sweet little duck; but no sign of *them*, so I came back home".

"Arghh, that was them, you *stupid* girl. One feather from that duck and I'd have had them both".

And she sent Bag o'Bones off again, in pursuit, to bring them back.

Anwen and the young man, back in human form, were running, running through the forest. Once again, they sensed they were being chased, they *heard* the sound of pursuit. Anwen took out another leaf, the fourth one. "We must hide again", she said, "but this time: you be a bush, and I will be a bee."

The footprints on the path had disappeared again.

"Little bee, little bee, did you see a young woman, and young man, pass by this way?"

But bee said nothing, it just buzzed, and buzzed, and disappeared into the pink folds of a rose.

"Pfft". Bag o' Bones turned round, and went back the way she came.

When she got home: "Well, have you brought me what you found?"

But all Bag o'Bones could say was, "I found nothing... I went in the forest, and followed their footprints. The pond had gone, and the duck, but there was a little bush, and on the bush there was a rose — a bit odd, that, a bit out of season — and a little buzzy bee, but.."

"Argghh," cried the witch. "A rose? A bee. That was them, you *stupid* girl! One petal from that rose, and I'd have had them both. Go off, and get them,. and bring them back to me..."

And so off went Bag o' Bones for the the third time, into the forest. Anwen and the young man, in humam form again, running, running, through the forest, sensed her coming, heard her. Anwen took out another leaf: "you be a tree", she said, "I will be an apple."

"Little apple, little apple swinging on your stalk. Did you see a young woman, a young man pass by this way?"

The apple said nothing. It just swayed in the wind.

Bag of Bones went back.

"Have you brought me what you found?"

"I didn't find nothing. I went in the forest. I followed their footprints. I couldn't find a pond or a duck or a bush or a bee. All I could see was a tree. And on the tree, a single little cheeky red apple, and..."

"You *stupid* girl. If you wanna do something, you gotta do it yourself. Get out of the way". And off went the witch, running even swifter than thought.

Anwen and the young man, in human form again, came to the edge of the forest. There was nowhere left for them to hide. They could sense someone coming, *hear* someone approaching. They came to a crossroads. Anwen reached into her pocket. There were just two leaves left. She took one for herself, and gave the other to the young man.

"You go that way, and I'll go this. I'll see you here in a week. If you find your way home, don't let anyone kiss you. The spell you were under may not be fully broken . If you're kissed, you'll forget me, and all that has just happened."

The young man ran his way, and Anwen went hers.

As she ran, she sensed something behind her, heard something behind her, getting closer, closer, faster than thought. At the last moment, Anwen dropped the leaf she was carrying on to the floor. Behind her, the witch, reached out to grab her... stepped on the leaf... In an instant, the witch was transformed into a sow. Chasing behind: Bag o' Bones. She reached the spot where Anwen was stood, with the sow. Bag o' Bones, breathless, stopped: looked at Anwen. Looked at the sow. And smiled. She licked her lips, took the sow, and started to lead it back the way she had come...

By whatever magical sense it is that leads us home when we are lost, the young man man followed his path. He felt as if he recognised the hillsides and valleys, as if they had been etched into his very soul from brith. As the paths seemed to become more familiar, his pace increased, he started to walk faster, he started to run.

By the time he reached the old house where he had grown up in as a child, the house where he'd happily played in the garden and partied on the terrace, he was breathless. The old family dog heard the boy's familiar footsteps, smelled the boy's familiar smell. In its excitement to greet its old master, it rushed across the yard, jumped up with its paws on the young man's chest, and licked his face in a great big slobbery, doggy, [smooch]...

The young man's father looked out of the window. Surely that wasn't..? It was... He ran outside, greeted and embraced his child...

"Thank God, thank God you've returned. You've been away so long. I was afraid something had happened to you. But where have you been, what have you been doing?"

The young man pushed the older man away, now dazed, confused.

"I? I'm sorry", he said. "Who are you? Where am I? Who am I?"

But what now of Anwen? She had returned home, back to the home where she'd lived with her mother. But as she'd approached the cottage, she saw no smoke coming out from the chimney; there were no hens scratching in the yard.

Anwen pushed open the door, saw her grandmother on the bed in the corner of the room, cold and still.

An old woman, older than the hills, who had known the girl's mother, and her grandmother's mother, and her grandmother's grandmother before her, was dressing the body of her friend.

"She couldn't wait for you any longer."

The girl nodded. "And my wait is over too..."

Anwen went to dresser, took out two shifts. One was finished, one was not. In the corner of the room was a spinning wheel, covered in dust and cobwebs. The girl sat at the spinning wheel, sewed up the second shift, completed it.

In the distance, a solitary bell started to ring, sounding out the death of a local lord.

The girl placed one shift by the door. "I will see he gets it", said the old, old woman, as old as the hills. "I will take it to him." The girl took the other.

After a week, Anwen returned to the crossroads. No-one came to meet her. She took to wandering. She had no family, she had no money, she had: no-one; nothing. She had to sleep under hedges, in sheds and in outhouses. She walked until her hair was matted with twigs and leaves, until her clothes were no more than rags, once white, now grey, until her shoes were worn away.

At last, she came to a village, where an old man took pity on her, gave her tea to drink, and some food to eat.

The old man told her stories of that place. Of a house, just outside the village, that used to be a happy house, but now was known as the weeping house. He said there was a tale told about that house, that if any young woman could make the young man who lived there smile, she could marry him. But that was just a story.

And so it was that that the young girl had finished her story. Outside, in the distance, a bell tolled.

She looked at the young man, still sat at the end of his bed, with a bucket between his feet, but he wasn't crying any more. He looked at the girl. He dried his eyes, raised up his clenched fist, and opened his hand. In it, a single, solitary leaf.

And that *is* the end of the story.

## The Devil's violin

And this is probably the final story...

*Based on Sara Liisa Wilkinson's telling.*

The first time she saw him, she knew she had to have him. The young hunter was setting up his stall on the other side of the market square, and she knew, she knew from that very moment, he was the one she wanted.

She tried to catch his eye, but he was busy arranging the stall. Her family were already setting off back home, and *why did they always have to do this...? Always at just the wrong time...*

The next market-day arrived. She walked past the stall several times, trying to catch his eye. But it was as if he looking straight through her. As if she wasn't there, wasn't part of his world at all.

And so it went on, from one market day to the next.

Once, on the way home, she let out a sob. Her mother asked what the matter was. Her brother teased her. Her sister tried to cheer her up with tales of princes, carrying them away, and putting their cruel brother to a painful death. And her father made one of his indecipherable jokes that made her smile, even through her tears.

When they got home, with her mother, she made a plan.

The next market day, the girl went to the young hunter's stall. But despite her smiles, and her feminine wiles and guiles, it was as if he were more interested in his kill, and his craft, than in her.

"I'll find my own way home" she said, and set of walking home alone through the forest. She felt humiliated, not spurned, but unseen. As she approached the cross-roads, she muttered to herself, under-her breath: "I would do anything to get him, anything at all".

Now if there's one thing, one lesson, that you need to learn from stories, it's to watch out for what not to say when you get to a crossroads.

"Anything?" said a figure that hadn't been there before, appearing out of the shadows .Tall, dark, and as the Brothers Grimm might say, dressed in a long, green coat.  "Anything at all? Then maybe I can help you?" And he smiled.

And she looked at him.

And he looked at her. And: "It is a him, I assume, that's upset you? Would you give anything for him?" and now rather uncertainly, given the question had actually been asked, the deal apparently offered, she nodded. But thenm the conditions... "Even if it were for just one year, and one day?"

She looked down to the ground.

The boots he wore beneath his dark green coat were... rather unusual. Furry boots. With odd toes. Cloven footed, almost. She raised her head, looked back at the man, stared right back at him. Determined.

"Anything."

"Then I will help you", said the devil, for who else could it be, and he smiled right back at here. "But first, you will need to do something... *for me*".

And she nodded.

"Would you go home and bring me back the thing that brings you most joy."

The most joy? Was that a fair trade? But when she thought of the joy that should could have with the young hunter for a year and a day, she agreed.

As she turned and started to walk home, she wondered jsut what it was that brought her most joy...

She rummaged through her things, her old toys - ha, that old doll — her clothes, her hairbrush? Her mirror? She rummaged around, heard her father calling "what are you doing in there?" and made some sort of joke to himself, and as he chuckled to himself, she smiled to herself, and... "Dad? Would you do something for me?"

And as a father of a daughter, what would he *not* do for her, when she asked so nicely...?

"Can you help me, in the woods?", and they left the house together, and set off, hand in hand. And sometimes she went ahead, and sometimes, it was as if she were tryimng to hold him back.

As they came in sight of the cross-roads, the tall dark man in the long green coat came in view. He smiled, and clicked `[click]` his fingers. And where the girl's father had been, there were now just bones. And she looked at them in shock. And gasped. And tears welled up in her eyes.

Very deliberately, the devil picked up the chest bones and the neck bones and he fashioned them into a hollow box, with a small neck stciking out of one side of it, and the girl said: "oh, my father's bones..." and she dried her eyes... "they have never shone so bright", and she looked at the devil with curiosity now in her eye.

And then the devil said: "do you still want this man, even if it were just for one month and one day?"

And the girl said, "I do".

"Then go home and bring back the thing that gives you the most strength."

And she turned, and she walked home rather more quickly this time, because if it were for one month and day, there was not a day to lose. And as she did so, she racked her mind thinking "what could that be? What is it that gives me the most strength?"

And as she got back home, she saw her mother, drawing water from the well. And she smiled. Her mother, always tireless, always able to make her feel better, always able to make her feel...

"Mother, could you, could you help me. There is some-wo... something I need you to help me with, in the woods..."

And what mother could deny her daughter? And hand in hand they set off, walking back through the woods.

As they came in sight of the cross-roads, the devil in the long green coat smiled, and clicked `[click]` his fingers. And where the girl's mother had been, there were now just bones, and her mother long gray silvery hair. And the girl looked at them, and then straight back at the devil. With a gleam of anticipation in her eye.

And as the devil took the bones, and the hair, and fashioned them into a long, taught bow, the girl said, "oh, how my mother's hair has never pulled so tight".

And the devil said: "do you still want this man, even if it is just for one day and one night?"

And the girl said, "Oh, I do, I really, really do...".

"Then go home, and bring me back what gives you the most hope and the most despair."

And by now, the girl knew how this game was to be played, and she sprinted back all the way home,  because for just one night and one day, there was no time to waste, and when she got back there she called to her brother, and sister, "come with me, come and play, there is someone I want you to meet..."

And what younger brother and sister would not go with the sister, so full of excitement, and she led them running, and chatting, and laughing, and as they turned the corner: [click], once, [click], twice.

Where the brother and sister had been, all that was left was their tongues and their finger bones. And there was a fire in the girl's eye.

And the devil screwed the finger bones into the neck of the strange box he had fashioned before, and he split their tongues and stretched them over the hollow box and wrapped them round the finger bones. And as he tightened then, he pinged them, and the girl said, "oh, my brother's and sister's voices have never sounded so sweet..." And she smiled at the devil.

And he took that strange instrument and he gave it to the girl.

Ans she placed it beneath her chin.

And he gave her the bow, and he said: "now play".

And if you've ever heard anyone play the violin for the first time, then you know how it sounds. Horrible. Just horrible.

And the Devil said, "this may take some time... You'll need some practice..."

And it did take some time. But the girl did practice, and she practiced hard, so hard it made her fingers bleed and her joints ache. And some times she forget just why she was practicing, and other times she didn't. But with the Devil's help, she started to tame that instrument, to make it sing, to speak, of joy, of strength, of hope, and despair.

The first time she played in the market square, she was rather nervous, and the people just walked by.

The second time played, she started to play individual people, catching their ear, and their eye, and causing them to stop a moment, and to watch, and to listen.

The third time she played, she started to play the crowd that was gathering. She started to play the crowd and she found thay she could make them do whatever she wanted. She played fast, and they danced; she played slow, and they wept. And as she played, she saw the boy. The young hunter. Watching her. And who was huntung who, I could not say.

When she had finished, she put the violin back in its case, made her way through the crowd. The young hunter watched her approaching, started to follow her as she glanced back behind at him. She held her hand back out towards him, and as he reached out for it, she led him out of the square.

"Help yourself to anything" she said, when they had got back to her house, "anything at all..." and she smiled. "Even me..." And he blushed. "But *DO NOT* touch the violin".

And they kissed, and they touched, and whatever else happened throughout the rest of that day, and that night, happened between two consenting adults, and is perhaps best left unsaid, so that nobody is embarrassed.

The next norning, the young man woke up first... and he went to make breakfast, because he thought that he should. And he remembered something of the night before, and smiled; and then he remmebered something of the day before, and smiled again; and then as he remembered the way the girl had played the violin and played the crowd, he saw the violin case. And he remembered what the girl had said: "do NOT touch the violin".

But looking wasn't touching, so very very gently, very very slowly, carefully, cautiously, he opened the case...

...and looked...

And the violin was wrapped in rich, dark cloth.

And before he realised what he was doing, he lifted the case closer to him and lifted the cloth...

And before he realised what he was doing, he was lifting the violin out of the case to get a better look......

And then he imagined playing the violin... like she could... and he pretended to play.... air violin style...

And he imagined hearing the crowd... and he imagined hearing the violin... it was almost as if he could really hear it.. Father's bones... Speaking to him.... Mother's bones... Calling him... Brother's and sister's tongues and bones... and he as pretended to play faster and faster, the noise got louder and louder... Father's bones...  Mother's bones... Brother's and sister's tongues and bones.

And he could imagine seeing his fingers bleed as he played, as hers surely did, and then he saw his fingers were actually bleeding, but when he went to wipe the blood off.. the blood was from the violin... from the strings themeselves... from betweem the.. the bones that made up the instrument, that dreadful instrument and he didn't know if it was him, or her, who screamed first... "What the HELL do you think you are you doing....?"

And he dropped the violin, aghast at it, seeing it for what it was... and he looked at the girl.. and she looked at him...

"I... what am I doing? What is that, what is that thing...? What have you done...?"

And he looked around at the cottage, which was fashioned like something your parents would live in (but where were her parents?) and had clutter of younger brothers and sisters about it.... But there was no brother or sister...?

And she said "what have I done? What haven't I done? Don't you know the sacrifices I've made? Don't you know the sacrifices my family have made? So that I could get to this... So that I could get to you..."

But with that, the young man had fled the cottage, back to the town "I'll tell them, I'll tell them what sort of a....what you..." And away he ran...

And the girl glared after him. And carefully, very carefully, lifted the violin, wiped it clean, placed it in the case, folded the rich dark cloth over it, closed the lid, and started to walk after him.

When she got to the market square, the young man was feverishly trying to tell anyone who would listen what he had just seen... and as the girl walked to the centre of the square, their eyes were on her... and as she started to play, they started to listen, and as she started to play faster, they started to move faster, and when the boy pushed through the crowd and grabbed the violin and told the crowd what he had seen they stood stock still. And started to boo, and to shout, and...

"Yes", he said, "yes, she did those things..."

And they let him know what they thought;

"Gerroff"... "Let her play..." And the boy knew whose side they were on.

The girl smiled at him. Through the crowd, she saw a tall, dark man in a long green coat. He smiled at her, then looked directly at the young hunter. [Click] And with that, the boy was gone, and the violin fell to the floor. The girl bent down to pick it up, and with it, before it rolled away, the last trace of the boy: a tiny scroll, looking for all the world like a tiny skull. And she affixed to the end of the violin.

And once again, she started to play. And as she did so, the man in the green coat smiled one last time, and walked away. His work was done. As for the girl? She looked at the crowd, with fire in her eyes, and the dancing started again... And for all I know — as far as I know — she is playing on still...

And that is the end of that.
