A gypsy enterprise of the romantic sort which the popular mind attributes to that mysterious people, furnishes the subject of one of the best known ballads of Ayrshire, The scene of the ballad was Cassillis House, on the banks of the Doon, before whose door still stands the ancient Dule-Tree or Tree of Sorrow. The heroine was some fair and frail Countess of Cassillis, wife of a chief of the Kennedys ; and tradition avers that "Johnnie Faa," the leader of the gypsy band, was a young knight. Sir John Fall, who had been her lover before her marriage.

JOHNNIE FAA.

The gypsies cam' to our gude lord's yett,  
And O but they sang sweetly;  
They sang sae sweet and sae very complete  
That doun cam' our fair lady.

And she cam' tripping down the stair,  
And all her maids before her;  
As soon as they saw her weel-faured face  
They cuist the glamourye `[The gypsies have always been credited with the powers of magical illusion, or hypnotism.]` o'er her.

"O come with me," says Johnnie Faa,  
"O come with me, my dearie;  
For I vow and I swear, by the hilt of my sword.  
That your lord shall nae mair come near ye."

Then she gi'ed them the red red wine,  
And they gi'ed her the ginger;  
But she gi'ed them a far better thing,  
The gowd ring aff her finger.

"Gae tak' frae me this gay mantle. 
And bring to me a plaidie;  
For if kith and kin and a' had sworn,  
I'll follow the gypsy laddie.

"Yestreen I lay in a weel-made bed,  
Wi' my gude lord beside me;  
This night I'll lie in a tenant's barn.  
Whatever shall betide me!"

"O baud your tongue, my hinny and my heart!  
O haud your tongue, my dearie!  
For I vow and I swear by the moon and the stars.  
That your lord shall nae mair come near ye."

But when our lord cam' hame at e'en,
And speired for his fair lady.  
The ane she cried, and the other replied,  
"She's awa' wi' the gypsy laddie!"

"Gae saddle to me the black black steed,  
Gae saddle and mak' him ready;  
Before that I either eat or sleep  
I'll gae seek my fair lady."

O we were fifteen weel-made men,  
Although we werena bonnie;  
And we were a' put down for ane,  
A fair young wanton lady.

According to tradition the lady when brought back was first, by a refinement of cruelty, compelled to witness from a window the dying agonies of the gypsy party, including her disguised lover, on the Dule-Tree; she was then divorced by her lord *a mensa et thovo*, and was finally imprisoned for life in the castle of Maybole. There to this day, far overhead above the street, is pointed out the window of the room in which she was confined, and in which she occupied her leisure in working the story of her flight in tapestry. The Earl in the meanwhile, it is said, married another wife.
