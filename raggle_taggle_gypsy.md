A gypsy enterprise of the romantic sort which the popular mind attributes to that mysterious people, furnishes the subject of one of the best known ballads of Ayrshire, The scene of the ballad was Cassillis House, on the banks of the Doon, before whose door still stands the ancient Dule-Tree or Tree of Sorrow. The heroine was some fair and frail Countess of Cassillis, wife of a chief of the Kennedys ; and tradition avers that "Johnnie Faa," the leader of the gypsy band, was a young knight. Sir John Fall, who had been her lover before her marriage.

JOHNNIE FAA.

The gypsies cam' to our gude lord's yett,  
And O but they sang sweetly;  
They sang sae sweet and sae very complete  
That doun cam' our fair lady.

And she cam' tripping down the stair,  
And all her maids before her;  
As soon as they saw her weel-faured face  
They cuist the glamourye `[The gypsies have always been credited with the powers of magical illusion, or hypnotism.]` o'er her.

"O come with me," says Johnnie Faa,  
"O come with me, my dearie;  
For I vow and I swear, by the hilt of my sword.  
That your lord shall nae mair come near ye."

Then she gi'ed them the red red wine,  
And they gi'ed her the ginger;  
But she gi'ed them a far better thing,  
The gowd ring aff her finger.

"Gae tak' frae me this gay mantle. 
And bring to me a plaidie;  
For if kith and kin and a' had sworn,  
I'll follow the gypsy laddie.

"Yestreen I lay in a weel-made bed,  
Wi' my gude lord beside me;  
This night I'll lie in a tenant's barn.  
Whatever shall betide me!"

"O baud your tongue, my hinny and my heart!  
O haud your tongue, my dearie!  
For I vow and I swear by the moon and the stars.  
That your lord shall nae mair come near ye."

But when our lord cam' hame at e'en,
And speired for his fair lady.  
The ane she cried, and the other replied,  
"She's awa' wi' the gypsy laddie!"

"Gae saddle to me the black black steed,  
Gae saddle and mak' him ready;  
Before that I either eat or sleep  
I'll gae seek my fair lady."

O we were fifteen weel-made men,  
Although we werena bonnie;  
And we were a' put down for ane,  
A fair young wanton lady.

According to tradition the lady when brought back was first, by a refinement of cruelty, compelled to witness from a window the dying agonies of the gypsy party, including her disguised lover, on the Dule-Tree; she was then divorced by her lord *a mensa et thovo*, and was finally imprisoned for life in the castle of Maybole. There to this day, far overhead above the street, is pointed out the window of the room in which she was confined, and in which she occupied her leisure in working the story of her flight in tapestry. The Earl in the meanwhile, it is said, married another wife.

The Ballad of "Johnny Faw"

The traditional story of the elopement of a Countess of Cassillis with a certain "Johnnie Faw, the Gypsy laddie," is popularly placed in the first half of the seventeenth century. The story is of old standing, as is also the ballad which has helped to perpetuate it. But, according to Sir William Fraser, it has no historical basis to stand upon. That writer `[In his Memorials of the Mortigomeries, Earls of Eglinton (Edinburgh, 1859), vol. i. pp. ix-xii.]` points out that the Lady Cassillis identified as the heroine of the ballad and tale died greatly regretted by her husband, after twenty-one years of married life. And he maintains that the "great respect and tenderness for the memory of the Countess Jane" which the Earl evinced, "is quite inconsistent with the story of her elopement with the Gipsy King." It might be urged that this is a matter of opinion; and that, the Gypsy lover and his band having been hanged in front of the castle (as tradition states), the escapade may have been overlooked and eventually almost forgotten. Or, the correctness of the tale may be questioned only as regards the date fixed upon. The tradition is certainly deep-rooted. As a ballad it is very widespread, and as a story it still clings to the scene of the alleged adventure ; where a ford `[More probably a series of stepping-stones.]` across the Eiver Doon bears the name of "the Gypsies' Steps." But there is apparently no historical evidence to bear out the story. `[Even such a detail as the existence of a certain piece of tapestry commemorating the event (Anderson's Scottish Nation, i. 607) receives no confirmation at the present day; as I am assured that no such tapestry exists in the castle referred to, or is remembered by the representative of the family. Curiously enough, a piece of tapestry representing an incident in the life of these same Gypsy Faws, but of later date, is stated by Mr Simson (History, p. 237) to have been preserved in a Fifeshire family, of good social position, with whom they had intermarried.]` This also is the view taken by Professor Child, who, in his English and Scottish Popular Ballads (Part VIL, Boston, 1890), gives eleven different versions of the ballad (while a twelfth variant was recently obtained by Mr John Sampson from some English Gypsies; for which see Gyp.-Lore Soc. Jour., ii. 84-85).

A casual reference in one version of the Faw-Cassillis tradition suggests another Gyspy incident. The arrival of the Gypsy lover at the Countess's home is thus described: — "One evening as she was taking her accustomed walk on the battlements of the castle of Cassillis, on the left bank of the Doon, she descried a band of Gypsies hastily approaching. Such bands were very common at that period, but the number and suspicious appearance of this company were calculated to create considerable alarm On arriving at the house, however, instead of offering violence, they commenced some of their wild strains," and so on with the tale. `[Anderson's Scottish Nation, i. 607.]` This reference to the formidable appearance then presented by a band of Gypsies is quite borne out by the many references in the statutes to their predatory habits, to the "insolencies" they committed, and to the fact that they went armed, and would "even attack the lieges with hagbuts and pistolets when opposed." `[For confirmation of this practice, even in the eighteenth century, see Simson's History, p. 205, note. In passing, it may be noticed that Sir Walter Scott had recognised the formidable character of the Gypsy gangs in times anterior to his own, when, in describing the appearance of a certain old Scottish manor-house, he employs these words: — "Neither did the front indicate absolute security from danger. There were loop-holes for musketry, and iron stanchions on the. lower windows, probably to repel any roving band of Gipsies, or resist a predatory visit from the caterans of the neighbouring Highlands " ( Waveriey, ch. viii. ).]` And the fears ascribed to the Countess of Cassillis at the sight of the Gypsy band are (whatever the truth of that tradition) quite in agreement with the following anecdote:—

"A writer in Blackwood's Magazine mentions that the Gipsies late in the seventeenth century, broke into the house of Pennicuik [Mid-Lothian], when the greater part of the family were at church. Sir John Clerk, the proprietor, barricaded himself in his own apartment, where he sustained a sort of siege — firing from the windows upon the robbers, who fired upon him in return. One of them, while straying through the house in quest of booty, happened to ascend the stairs of a very narrow turret, but, slipping his foot, caught hold of the rope of the alarm bell, the ringing of which startled the congregation assembled in the parish church. They instantly came to the rescue of the laird, and succeeded, it is said, in apprehending some of the Gipsies, who were executed. There is a written account of this daring assault kept in the records of the family." `[Simson's History, pp. 195-96. See also Mr John J. Wilson's ArmdU of Penicuik, Edinburgh, 1891.]`

—THE WRAGGLE TAGGLE GIPSIES, O!

1 Three gipsies stood at the Castle gate,  
They sang so high, they sang so low,  
The lady sate in her chamber late,  
Her heart it melted away as snow.

2 They sang so sweet, they sang so shrill,  
That fast her tears began to flow.  
And she laid down her silken gown,  
Her golden rings and all her show.

3 She pluck-ed off her high-heeled shoes,  
A-made of Spanish leather, O.  
She would in the street, with her bare, bare feet;  
All out in the wind and weather, O.

4 O saddle to me my milk-white steed,  
And go and fetch me my pony, O!  
That I may ride and seek my bride,  
Who is gone with the wraggle taggie gipsies, O!

5 O he rode high, and he rode low,  
He rode through wood and copses too,  
Until he came to an open field,  
And there he espied his a-lady, O!

6 What makes you leave your house and land?  
Your golden treasures for to go?  
What makes you leave your new-wedded lord,  
To follow the wraggle taggle gipsies, O?

7 What care I for my house and my land?  
What care I for my treasure, O?  
What care I for my new-wedded lord,  
I'm off with the wraggle taggle gipsies, O!

8 Last night you slept on a goose-feather bed,  
With the sheet turned down so bravely, O!  
And to-night you’ll sleep in a cold open field,  
Along with the wraggle taggle gipsies, O!


g What care I for a goose-feather bed, With the sheet turned down so bravely, O! For to-night I shall sleep in a cold open feld, Along with the wraggle taggle gipsies, O!
