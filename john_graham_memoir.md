*Proceedings of the Old Bailey, 17th October, 1781*

JOHN GRAHAM. Royal Offences; coining offences. 17th October 1781.

671. JOHN GRAHAM was indicted for unlawfully causing and procuring to be engraved and cut in mezzotinto, upon a certain plate of copper, a blank promissory note, containing the word Ten, expressing the sum and amount of the said promissory note in white letters upon a black ground , October the 4th .

JOHN BAILEY sworn.

I am an engraver, in Fleet-market. I saw the prisoner, as well as I can recollect, the first time was in June last. I met him accidentally at a public-house, in Fleet-market, where I used to go to read the newspaper. Finding he kept an academy, I shewed him some specimens of my work, as an engraver, which the prisoner seemed very much to approve. Soon afterwards, he applied to me to engrave a bank-note: I then positively refused, and told him the consequence, which would be fatal to us both; I conceiving at that time it would be a capital offence in both of us. Then it passed on. I did not see him again till the middle of August. Then falling into conversation, and renewing his acquaintance with me, he said he hoped I was not displeased with him for what he had asked me to do before; and then he asked me again if I would engrave the bank-notes, and offered to pay me 100*l.* for the engraving; and, if that was not sufficient, I should have half of the first 500*l.* worth that should be negociated. I, upon this second offer, said it was a matter of consequence, and would require some time to consider. I immediately went to Mr. Alderman Sainsbury, and asked his advice what to do. From that time, I having given him this uncertain answer, he used to call on me almost every day, from the middle of August till the latter end of September; and at last, on the 27th of September, he called about noon; and said he was going for a note, to the Bank. He asked me which way he should obtain a note. I told him the method. He went; and I met him again, as he returned. He told me he had got the note; and at three in the afternoon he brought to my house a bank-note for 10*l.* He then desired me to take the measure of that note, for a plate. I took it rather less than the note, at first. He observed that, and said it should be the full size, because there was no mark of a plate upon the bank-note; and then I took the measure exactly. He gave me half-a-crown, to pay for the plate. I ordered the plate, and was to have it the next morning; but it did not come. The prisoner called in the afternoon, and he sent my maid for the plate to Benjamin Wittow's, White-lion court Shoe-lane. It was brought by a servant, and delivered to the prisoner; and he said it was a very fine plate. The plate came to 2*s.* 4*d.* I had but 2*s.* in my pocket; and it coming to 4*d.* more, Mr. Graham gave me 6*d.* in order to get change, to pay that 4*d.*; but the man who brought it having no change, I gave Mr. Graham the 6*d.* back again, and the man trusted me the 4*d.* The prisoner told me, now I had got the plate, to go on as fast as possible. The next day the prisoner came again. I had then laid the note upon the plate, which was the first step prepara tory to engraving it, and I went to work then in the prisoner's presence. As often as my servant came near the window, the prisoner held up a sheet of paper against the work going on, in order that it might not be seen what it was. I engraved the outlines then, and the word Ten, which expressed the sum, was engraved white upon black. I finished this plate on the 4th of October. The prisoner came for it that day, and he was taken up about three quarters of an hour after. (The plate, and the note from which it was copied, shewn the witness.)

Bailey. I am sure this is the note the prisoner brought for me to copy; and this is the plate I engraved by direction of the prisoner.

MARTHA WINSLEY sworn.

I am servant to Mr. Bailey, an engraver, in Fleet-market. I know the prisoner: I have seen him in my master's house often. The first time I recollect seeing him was in July. On the day before Michaelmas-day, I went, by the prisoner's directions, for a copper-plate, to Mr. Wittow's, in Shoe-lane; and it was brought, and paid for: my master gave the man 2*s.* and Mr. Graham gave him 6*d.* The man not having 2*d.* in his pocket, my master gave Graham the 6*d.* back again, and the man trusted him the 4*d.* The day before the prisoner was apprehended, he called and asked my master whether the business was done. He said, No; it would be done the next day, at one o'clock. I understood this as referring to the plate; for my master shewed him the plate, and I saw it. He approved of it much, and bid him go on.

(John Savage , a servant to Mr. Wittow, confirmed the testimony of the two former witnesses relative to what passed on bringing the plate to Bailey.)

Mr. CHARLES GILLMORE sworn.

I am a teller in the Bank. I remember the prisoner coming for a 10*l.* note, on the 27th of September. He gave me the cash, and I made out a ticket for the note. I am positive to the person of the prisoner.

THOMAS ORME sworn.

I am a cashier of the Bank. I made out that note, and gave it to the prisoner. I am positive to the person of the prisoner.

Mr. ACTON sworn.

I am solicitor to the Bank. The plate and note now produced were delivered to me by Bailey, at his lodgings, at the time the prisoner was taken up, and in the prisoner's presence.

GUILTY . Imp. 6 Months.

Tried by the London Jury, before Mr. RECORDER.

*Proceedings of the Old Bailey, 11th September, 1782.*

JANE GRAHAM. JOHN GRAHAM. Deception; forgery. 11th September 1782.

495. JOHN GRAHAM and JANE his wife were indicted, for that they on the 8th day of June last, at the parish of St. Margaret's, Westminster, having in their possession a certain bank note, No. K. 87.

signed John Benet , entered W. Rawlins, for the sum of 15*l.* did feloniously alter the same by obliterating and defacing the letters e, e, n, and falsely forging and counterfeiting the letter y in two places in the said bank note, whereby the said bank note did become, import, and signify 50*l.* with intent to defraud the Governor and Co. of the bank of England.

Second Count. The same as the first, only charging it to be with intent to defraud Cary Boucher and Christopher Alderson.

Third Count. For feloniously uttering and publishing the said note, knowing it to be forged and altered with intent to defraud the bank.

Fourth Count. The same as the third, only charging it to be with intent to defraud Carey Boucher and Christopher Alderson.

Fifth Count. The same as the first, only the words 50*l.* instead of 15*l.* with intent to defraud the bank.

Sixth Count. To defraud Boucher and Alderson.

Seventh Count. For publishing a certain other bank note the same as the third, only the words 15*l.* instead of 50*l.* with intent to defraud the bank.

Eighth Count. The same as the sixth with intent to defraud Boucher and Alderson.

(The prisoner John observed there was a mistake in the indictment, as his wife's name was Janet instead of Jane, but the court informed him, that he having pleaded in chief could not plead in abatement, but that if he had not pleaded the privilege would only have been momentary as another indictment could immediately be preferred.)

Mr. Fielding stated the indictment, and Mr. Howarth council for the crown opened the case as follows:

Gentlemen of the jury, I am counsel against the two prisoners, John and Jane Graham , who stand charged as you have heard from the indictment, with forging and altering a bank note, and with the disposing and putting off that bank note so forged and altered, knowing of its being forged and counterfeited. The policy of the law in order to correct a mischief so extremely injurious to the public credit, has made each of these offences a capital felony; it will be the object therefore of your inquiry to judge from evidence whether the prisoners both of them, or each of them, have committed either of these offences imputed to them in the indictment: perhaps in defence of the prisoner Jane Graham it may be argued she is a married woman, and charged as the wife of the prisoner John therefore intitled in point of law to some privilege which will protect her from the guilt of which she is charged. It behoves me to state to you, subject to the correction of the court, what I conceive to be the law in that case; I take it that the extent of such rule, if there is any such laid rule down is this, where a married woman in company of her husband commits a larceny, and nothing more appears, than that she was in company of her husband, at the commission of that offence, there a presumption is raised from the humanity of the law, to suppose, that the woman committed that offence under the dominion and authority of her husband; but that, as well as any other presumption, can only stand till there is a proof to the contrary; for I take it to be equally clear, that if from the evidence it should appear, that the married woman was the active person, and acted without the controul or interference of the husband, it would be clear in point of law, that she was involved in the same degree of guilt; if it should appear that it was not in the presence of the husband but distinct from him, I take it to be clear, that a woman in that situation has no privilege whatever; this I conceive is the law on the subject, the forgery now charged on the prisoners is, that of altering a bank note which originally issued from the bank, a bank note for 15*l.* and by that alteration producing the operation and effect of a note of 50*l.* the manner in which that has been effected has been this, it has been contrived by some method or another, to discharge the double e, and n, from the word fifteen, both in the body of the note and in the black letters of the note, and to substitute in their place the letter y, by which these two words appear to

be fifty, the fraud on the public is just that sum between fifteen and fifty; I shall state to you very shortly what will be the evidence that will be laid before you, in order to satisfy you that the prisoners have been guilty of that offence. The prisoner has stated that from the number of council who appear against him, he has some reason to be alarmed, I would ease him of this fear, because every body knows, that the only use that is at this time of day made of council in criminal prosecutions, is merely to state with a little more accuracy, the facts, in order to shew immediately their connection to each other, and to disentangle them from that degree of obscurity which they would receive coming irregularly from the mouths of the witnesses, the jury ought to pay no attention to what is stated by council, but only to receive the evidence as it comes from the mouths of witnesses, on that they are to draw their own conclusions and to form their own judgment, therefore, I trust, the prisoner will be eased of any alarm of that sort; I shall discharge my duty simply in stating that evidence, and you will draw the conclusions. The prisoner John Graham was in April last discharged from confinement; his circumstances were to the last degree necessitous, at that time he had lived for many years with the woman at the bar, who is called Jane Graham , his wife; they have, I believe a large family of children; immediately upon his discharge he had formed this scheme, which I am sorry to say, had been in his contemplation some time before. In his judgment, this mode of fraud upon the public was the most easily effected: it being necessary in order to carry it into execution, that he should be furnished with letters of different sorts in order to compleat his forgery, for that purpose he applied himself to a Mr. Rayner, who was foreman to a Mr. Caslon, who is famous in this town as an engraver; Caslon recommended him to Mr. Hodgson who is an engraver on wood, and stated to be a person very likely to furnish him with such letters as he should want. On the 8th of May the prisoner, John Graham , applied to Hodgson to have the letter y cut for him, to produce the effect of white on a black ground, so as to resemble the letters on the bottom of a bank-note; Hodgson at first made some difficulty about it, he said it was to mark some books, and particularly wanted the letter y; Hodgson said it is not likely to produce the effect, for you must have a little printer's ink, and that will daub the books. The prisoner said they were for a whimsical gentleman, and accordingly they were cut for him; he called and paid Hodgson for them and took them away; some time after he called again, and said these letters did not quite answer his purpose, and he wanted some numbers, as 2, 3, 5, 20, 30, and so on: respecting the letter y, I shall produce to you the papers marked by the prisoner, and the alterations he wished to be made by Mr. Hodgson in the cut of the letter y, a number of letters were cut and figures made by Mr. Hodgson, which were called for and took away by the prisoner Jane the wife. When you inspect the letter y. upon the note produced to you, and compare it with the letter y. produced to you, and the copy of that Hodgson's has engraved, supported by Hodgson's evidence, it will appear to you beyond doubt, that the alteration and the forgery in this bank-note, was made by means of this letter engraved by Hodgson under the direction and order of the prisoner: also that the prisoner John took away and had possession of this letter: shortly after this we find these notes so altered put in circulation; here there appears to be considerable art in John. In no one instance is he to be connected with the putting off these notes; the whole of that is left to the conduct and management of the woman: and there is no instance in which he can be connected with the putting off any of these notes. On the 8th of June, the note in the indictment was put off by the prisoner Jane; she went to the shop of a Mr. Alderson, Silk-Mercer, in Bridge Street, Westmister, where after having bargained for somethings,
The remainder of this TRIAL in our next.


THE WHOLE PROCEEDINGS ON THE KING's Commission of the Peace, Oyer and Terminer, and Gaol Delivery for the CITY of LONDON; AND ALSO, The Gaol Delivery for the County of Middlesex; HELD AT JUSTICE HALL in the OLD BAILEY, On Wednesday the 11th of SEPTEMBER, 1782, and the following Days:

THE WHOLE PROCEEDINGS UPON THE
KING's Commission of the Peace, Oyer and Terminer, and Gaol Delivery for the CITY of LONDON, &c.

she put off to him one of the forged notes altered from 15*l.* to 50*l.* that note will be traced very accurately, so as to leave no doubt, and brought home to the prisoner Jane, negociated by her; in a very few days after it was discovered that this note was a forgery, and upon taking it to the bank it was found that a note of that letter, No. and date had been issued of 15*l.* but none of 50*l.* consequently from that circumstance, without more, they were perfectly satisfied that this was a forged note. There could be no such note issued from the bank; the inattention of the persons taking the note is wonderful, as there is such a space between the letter y and the pounds, that they must with a little attention have seen it: this caused an alarm as you may easily conceive, and the officers of the bank in endeavouring to trace the offender, had discovered that the prisoner had been observed to be full of money, and putting off notes, and buying goods; but though the most diligent search was making after him he was discovered by accident. A Mr. Wright fortunately saw the two prisoners alight out of a post-chaise at Winchester, and they were apprehended at Southampton. It will be unnecessary for me to state to you the number of notes, but I have proof it amounted to eight, as appears by the confession of the prisoner Jane on her examination. On the morning of their being apprended at Southampton, their trunk was opened and searched, on searching that, the sum of ninety and odd guineas, and a 15*l.* bank-note was found; the money in the trunk, the 15*l.* note in the pocket of the prisoner. In that trunk was also found a great number of experiments on thin paper, made to imitate bank paper, with letters of this kind of ground; and theimpression of the stamps cut by Hodgson the engraver; also a box of paste and a little brush, for the purpose of pasting these letters on, when the letters ?? e e n were discharged from the real bank-note; they then pasted a thin letter y on this paper in their place: then they pasted a bit of thin paper as if it had been worn by carriage. On John was found a 15*l.* bank-note, on which as it is stated to me, an attempt had been made to discharge the letters e e n in the body of the note, and it did not quite succeed; the paper seemed to have suffered in the operation and be made very thin; in the back of that note are figures cast up for the purpose of hiding the operation, which appears to be cut exactly in the same manner as these on the note circulated by the woman. From these circumstances you will draw what conclusions you think fit, this will be the nature of the evidence laid before you; on this evidence, in the first place, it will appear clear that there has been a forgery of the banknote committed by somebody. The question then is, By whom is that forgery commited? In order to satisfy you that that forgery must be committed by the prisoners, or at least by one of them you will have the evidence of Hodgson, who will state to you that the prisoner was put by him in possession of letters capable of effecting that alteration, and that that alteration was effected by means of these letters you cannot doubt, when I produce to you the pieces of paper in black and white, found in the box of the prisoners, in which these corresponding letters are found to be marked; I conceive that no doubts can remain that the forgery was occasioned by these letters, and by the possessor of these letters. Crimes of this sort are always committed in secret, where there is no eye to see; we can can only judge of them by probability. The forgery is as capable of commission by the woman as the man: there is no greater degree of ingenuity or art in this forgery, when you are in possession of the instruments that will make the letters, than to paste with great neatness the letter y where the letters e e n stood before. With respect to the other offence, the disposing and uttering these notes, you will observe, there is no evidence against John, except his being in company with this woman, standing to him in the relation of wife, having cohabited together as man and wife for many years, and going together to Southampton; you are to judge whether he is not to be connected with her in the crime of disposing of these notes. Gentlemen, these are the circumstances of this case, which I shall leave with you. I shall call my witnesses; and I trust, when you have heard them, you will be convinced, that the prisoners are both of them guilty of the offence charged in the indictment.
THOMAS HODGSON sworn.

(Examined by Mr. Sylvester.)

What are you? - A printer.

What else? - A letter-cutter in wood sometimes.

Where do you live? - In George's-Court, Clerkenwell.

Did you at any time see the prisoner John Graham? - He called on me from Mr. Caslon.

What day was it? - I cannot recollect the day Sir, about the 16th of May.

For what purpose? - He wanted two letters cut to stamp books for a gentleman in the country.

What passed? - He came from Mr. Caslon to get two letters cut in wood, I said I did not think it would answer the purpose, being a single letter, as if there was a line round it, because there is some difficulty to stamp a letter perpendicularly by the hand, I do not think any man could; and I told him if there was a line round it, it would stamp better; but he said he was a whimsical gentleman, and it was to mark his books where the authors names ended with a y. I told him it made no difference to me, I would cut it as I was in that way of business. He called again and paid me 1*s.* a-piece.

What kind of a letter did he describe he wanted to have cut? - A text y.

What were the directions he gave you? - He brought the second time a paper, he said he believed the gentleman would want some numbers, such as 1, 2, 3, 4, if so be that they answered the purpose.

Look at that paper? - The prisoner brought this as a direction for more stamps, he paid for the two marks, I believe about the 20th of May, and he came, I am not clear, but I think in June; and when he came the third time he brought these two papers, he wanted these numbers that are wrote; he said the gentleman did not understand drawing, but he left the body of the y to me; I said he had better send me drawings; he said the gentleman did not understand drawing, it was left intirely to me, only the body of the y was to be for the size of - the black letter that was to be cut. I cut these numbers that are written down, and I drew them according

to my own fancy; I did not draw the y's according to that copy, as he said the gentleman did not understand drawing, I thought it was left to my judgment, and therefore, I drew them according to the common method of text letters. (The prisoner desired a chair for his wife which was granted.) I drew it according to my judgment of making that letter, there are many variations in the manner of making it, but I drew it according to my own judgment; I cut all thom numbers that he had written down, and he came and paid me 2*s.* a piece for them, I made proofs of the whole that he had from me, there was 20.
Look at this? - (paper with proofs shown the witness) These are the marks that he had from me, I made them with my own hand.

Look at that? - This is what came afterwards, he had all them marks from me, and paid me 2*s.* a piece; some time after he came again and said the gentleman wanted a set of marks a size smaller; it was some time afterwards, I cannot tell the date, and these that were to be done was marked underneath by a line, which may be seen, I fancy in the proof; the tails of the y's some of them were to be turned the other way as appears by this proof, when he gave me directions to do this, he was not clear which way the tails of the y's should be turned, and he said he would write to the gentleman, and desired me to leave the tails unfinished, he said he would call in two or three days; in a few days he called and told me how to finish them, and said his servant should call for them, he was obliged to be out of town himself; a woman called for them, whom I have seen since in New-Prison.

Look if you see her now? - It is the prisoner at the bar, there was 14 and she paid me 24*s.* for them, this paper is the second that was done afterwards.

Counsel for the Prisoner. Can you fix the time when you delivered him the first letter? - The 20th of May.

The last May? - Yes.

What were the letters? - Two y's.

Which way were the tails of them turned? - The proofs are there.

He came from Mr. Caslon to you recommended, I understand? - Yes; I do a great deal of business for Mr. Caslon.

Do you recollect whether he said the gentleman he wanted them for, resided in England or Ireland? - A few miles out of town he told me.

Was you acquainted with the prisoner at the bar before he came from Mr. Caslon? - Never saw him in my life that I know of, only he said he came from Mr. Caslon.

You say the woman at the bar came for the last marks, did you ever see her before? - Not that I know of.

You have not recollected to say, I believe what money was paid for them by the person that fetched them? - The woman paid me 24*s.*

I am inclined to think that you are mistaken? - I am not mistaken.

Those that the woman fetched away, were the last that were done? - Yes; they were tied up in a bundle, she did not see them.

You did not make any more? - No Sir; I never heard any thing about them afterwards.

In all probability you never saw the woman again? - Not till I saw her in New-Prison.

When you saw them in Prison, you went to look at this woman as a person that belonged to Graham taken up for the forgery of the bank-bill? - I was sent to see if I knew them, and then I knew her to be the woman.

Prisoner. We were particularly pointed out to him.

Prisoner's Counsel. Mr. Graham do you chuse to leave your defence to me or not?

CHRISTOPHER ALDERSON sworn.

Where do you live? - In Bridge-street, Westminster.

What are you? - A mercer.

Do you know either of the prisoners at the bar? - The woman I know.

When did you first know her, where did you see her? - As much as I can recollect it was on the 8th of June, she came to our house in the evening about 7 o'clock,

it was approaching to dusk, she desired that she might see some quilted sattin coats, in consequence of that I shewed her some, and she fixed on one, and we agreed for the price very soon, when we had so done, she said, I have a bill to change, a bank bill for 50*l.* she shewed it me, I said, I I would change it for her; she desired to see some silks, she fixed on one, and I changed the note and gave her the difference, the goods came to 6*l.* 12*s.* I gave her two 15*l.* notes and the rest in cash.
Did you know at that time the numbers of the 15*l.* bank notes? - No I did not (a note shewn to him); this I believe to be the note I received from the prisoner Jane, I have reason to think it is, I remember the black mark that there is upon the top of it.

Who did you pay it to? - I paid it to George Capes .

Counsel for Prisoner. Do you know Mrs. Graham? - No, I never saw her before that time.

Perhaps not since until she was taken up? - No Sir.

All that you know the note by is this spot of dirt, you think it is the same? - Yes, that is all I know it by, and from my name that I put on it afterwards.

That is not the only note you took I suppose? - It was the only 50*l.* I had at that time.

What time was it when she came? - In the evening, rather late, about seven o'clock.

What is your shop? - A mercers shop.

Your windows are full of goods I suppose? - Yes.

GEORGE CAPES sworn.

Look at that note and inform the jury whether you received it from any body, and from whom? - I received one, I cannot say this is the same, a 50*l.* note, of Mr. Alderson, I gave it to my clerk Jackson a few hours after.

Counsel for Prisoner. Do you remember when you received that? - On the 13th of June.

THOMAS JACKSON sworn.

You were sent to Mr Cape? - Yes.

Did you receive a bank note of him? - Yes.

What did you do with it? - I carried it to Mr. Dorrien the banker, he refused it, I gave it to Mr. Atkins to return it to Mr. Boucher and Alderson, from whom Mr. Capes had received it.

JOHN ATKINS sworn.

What did you do with that bank note that you received from Mr. Jackson? - I took it to Mr. Alderson's at Westminster, and delivered it into his own hands; I believe this to be the note, it looks like it.

Alderson. Is that the note that you received from Atkins? - Yes, Sir, it is the same.

Prisoner's Counsel to Alderson. The note appears now produced in evidence to have your name upon it? - Yes Sir.

Now that name was not put on it when you paid it to your neighbour Mr. Capes, but after it was returned to you as a bad note? - Yes, I know it so far.

When it was brought back to you as a note that was not good, then you put your name on it, and not before? - Yes, Mr. Howarth.

You were satisfied it was the same note? - Yes.

ABRAHAM NEWLAND sworn.

You are the cashier of the bank? look at that note and inform the jury, whether that note ever issued from the bank, and in that form in which it now appears? - This note issued from the bank only in the form of a 15*l.* bank note, as will appear from the books, I presume I need not mention the alterations that have been made in it, they have been so often repeated.

In your notes of 50*l.* have they a double for a single f? - A double f.

(The note shewn to the Jury.)

Prisoner's Counsel. You have been speaking with respect to this bill, I do not see any of your writing on it? - There is not.


Then you cannot say whether this ever issued from the bank? - There were two of the notes of 15*l.* each from the entry.
Did you issue them? - No I did not.

Then all that your knowledge is founded upon, is some entry of the book? - I know the hand writing.

I suppose the parties that issued this bill are living, are they not? - Yes Sir.

Mr. Newland knows nothing of it? - I know it is a forgery.

JOHN BOULT sworn.

You are one of the cashiers of the bank? - Yes.

Look at that note it appears to be signed by you? - It was signed by me.

What was that note when it was issued from the bank? - A 15*l.* note.

Counsel for Prisoner. How do you know that, Sir, you see the note is an incompleat note, there are other letters introduced, what means of knowledge have you, that the note there is not in its original state? - I issued fifty 15*l.* notes, this is one.

You have a paper in your hand with your name to it, it was not in the condition it is? - I can swear it was only for 15*l.*

Why? - It does not correspond with the entry.

Did you see the entry made yourself? - No. I see it is a 15*l.* the f's are not made in the same manner, they are double f's.

Pray Mr. Boult I have not a doubt about the truth of what you say, but I would have you speak no further than your knowledge goes, do you see all the bills that are issued from the bank? - No, nor I did not see this issued.

Can you upon your oath say, in the multiplicity of your business, that a 50*l.* bank note never issued from the bank with such an f as that, can you say that positively, you can only speak to your belief Mr. Boult? - I believe it has always been customary.

But do not you frequently alter your plates? - Yes.

In order to make a variation, and to prevent forgery? - But never I believe with a single f.

But you cannot take upon you to say, that the bank have never issued such notes? - They have not lately.

But they might formerly? - Yes; but if you attend to the No. of this plate it is for the year 1781.

WILLIAM RAWLINS sworn.

I am the entering clerk.

Have you a note entered by you of that number, and for that date, and for what sum? - It was issued out a 15*l.* here is the name to it, and I am very positive to the sum.

Is that your writing in that book? - Yes.

Court. Was there any 50*l.* notes of that date issued by you? - Not one of that date.

Court. There is the letter and the number? - Yes my Lord.

Is that entry your writing? - I saw it done.

Who wrote it? you cannot speak to it; - I saw the entry in the book.

And cannot you recollect whose writing it is? - No, it was some of our people.

Have you signed the book? - No, Sir, only the note.

Shut the book, Sir, when was the entry made of this note? do not look at the book nor at any paper. - I cannot recollect.

Nor can you recollect the person that made the entry in your book? - I cannot.

Nor can you tell whose writing it is? - Not for certain.

How is there a possibility of your saying with precision, that no 50*l.* note was issued from the bank on that day? - By looking over the book for the day.

Have you looked over all the books of the bank? - Only my own.

Counsel for Prosecution. There is your name to that note, did it issue as a 15*l.* or a 50*l.* upon your oath? - Upon my oath as a 15*l.*

HENRY WRIGHT sworn.

You were one of the persons, I understand, that apprehended the prisoner? - Yes.


Where did you see him first? - At the sign of the George at Winchester; on the 11th of July last I saw a post-chaise come in, I saw Mr. Graham come out and Mrs. Graham, she was in a scarlet riding dress, I saw a hair trunk like this, whether this is it or no I cannot say, (a hair trunk produced). What day were they apprehended? On the 13th.
What occasioned their apprehension? - When I came to London, I mentioned to my master the governor of Tothill-fields Bridewell, that I had seen Graham at Winchester.

Prisoner's Counsel. Do not tell us what your master said.

You had orders to go in pursuit of them? - Yes; I apprehended them at the Coach and Horses at Southampton.

Did you search the prisoners? - I searched Mrs. Graham, and found nothing particular on her, she had a guinea, and a shilling or two; and the man that was with me, Gregory, searched him and found a 15*l.* note and some bits of paper, there was upon the table 31 guineas and a half in gold, that I swept off with me, and put into a purse.

Where did you get that trunk? - I asked her after he was secured, what is become of your hair-trunk, that I saw with you at Winchester? says she, Sir, I have sent it away; I says to Mr. Gregory, Bob, you take care of them, and I will go and enquire about that; I found the trunk up one pair of stairs in a bed-room, and Mrs. Graham had the key of that room in her pocket, she gave me the key of the room, the trunk was shut, it was opened afterwards at Winchester; the key of the trunk was delivered me by the maid whom I sent to search Mrs. Graham.

When the trunk was opened, what were the contents of it? - The first thing I found was a little gallypot of paste; she wanted sadly to put her hand in for a handkerchief, but I said she must not before Lord Banbury and all the gentlemen; I found a paper with 69 guineas and 2 half-guineas; searching further, my Lord, I found some paper and some stamps.

Was there any wearing apparel in the trunk? - A great deal, I have half a dozen things.

Were any of the things that were in the trunk claimed by either of the prisoners before the magistrate? - The shirts were claimed by Mr. Graham, and the money.

Produce the other things that you found in that trunk. (Produced the gallypot that the paste was in, and the bottle that the ink was in, the cloth that the stamps were in, and some thin paper, with a number of impressions of letters on it, and particularly one paper with y's stamped on it, where some of the y's appear to be cut off, and a paper with great and little y's.)

Counsel for the Prisoner. Where was you when Mrs. Graham was searched? - I was in the room with Mr. Graham, she was taken into a private room to be examined by women.

So that all that you know of the key where the trunk was, is that the maid gave it you? Yes, Sir.

In whose possession has the trunk been? - In my possession mostly; these papers never were out of my possession.

ROBERT GREGORY sworn.

You were with Wright when he apprehended Graham? - Yes; my lord.

Did you search John Graham? - I found this in his great-coat pocket, (a pocket book in a case with a 15*l.* note and some other papers.)

You have the shirts there? - Yes; two are dirty and four clean; one was taken off his back.

These you say were claimed by the prisoner as his? - Yes, Sir.

MARGARET RUSSELL sworn.

Where do you live? - In the Strand; I deal in ready made linen.

Look at that shirt that is there produced, and tell me whether there is any thing upon upon it, on which you have any recollection of it? - I know it.

Did you at any time sell it? - I sold it the 27th of May to Mrs. Graham, the prisoner.

How many shirts did you sell her? - Six.

How were you paid for them?

Prisoner's Counsel. I submit to your lordships, whether that question can be asked.

Court. Why do you ask the question Mr. Howarth? she was paid by a fifty pound bank bill, which I shall produce to you.

Court. We have considered of it, and it is not evidence, the case must rest here, upon this being a forged bill; she may have issued other forged bills, and may not have issued this.

- MACMANUS sworn.

Where did you find those things you produced? - At the house of one Mr. Morgan, in Bell-lane, Paddington.

ELIZABETH MORGAN sworn.

Where do you live? - In Bell-lane, Paddington.

Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - Yes; one is John, the other I am sure I do not know her christian name.

They lodged with you? - They did; she quitted my lodging at Christmas, on new year's day.

Do you remember that man, Mr. Macmanus coming to your house to search? - Yes; he found these things in a trunk, and some in the drawers; they desired to leave them with me, and said they were going to Scotland.

You remember their being apprehended and brought to town; how long was it before that? - About three weeks or a month; I only did it to serve the prisoner.

Were any of their family left with you? - There were four children brought to me on Saturday evening, they said they should be obliged to me to take care of them.

To Alderson. Look at that petticoat, and see if you have any recollection of it? - I believe it is the same that Mrs. Graham bought, the quilter is here.

MARY LOVELACE sworn.

I quilted this petticoat for Messrs. Boucher and Alderson.

Prisoner's Counsel. You never quilted such another? - I have quilted several, but never for any body else.

WILLIAM WOOD sworn.

I am a trunk-maker, in Coventry-street; I sold this trunk to Mr. and Mrs. Graham, he paid me for it.

To Hodgson. Are these the stamps you made? - They are the very stamps, but are not all here.

Court to Prisoners. Do you desire to say any thing for yourselves, or leave it to your counsel?

Prisoner John. She pleads by counsel.

Court. Your counsel cannot make any speech for you.

Prisoner John. We leave it to our counsel, and let our witnesses be called.

(Seven witnesses were called for the prisoner, and none appeared.)

JOHN WILSON sworn.

Mrs. Graham is my own sister; I never knew any thing to affect her reputation in any respect in my life; about fifteen years ago she was married, I was present at the wedding.

(After the evidence was summed up, the prisoner John begged to be heard a few words, which was granted by the court.)

Prisoner. My lord and gentlemen of the jury: we had seven witnesses here this day who would have spoken to many particulars that would have entirely proved our innocence; of these witnesses we are deprived, but by what means I cannot comprehend; they were a short time ago in the lord mayor's parlour, and were seen by Mr. Wilson; since which they have all been ordered to go away, contrary to our knowledge; the meaning of this manoeuvre heaven alone knows. They would have proved the meaning of the stamps, I had a commission to procure them for a gentleman, at Thames-street, to be sent to Mr. O'Hara of Dublin: I applied to the type makers, they directed me to the wood-cutters; I delivered the stamps, when made, to the gentleman, who if he had been called here would have acknowledged it. The notes likewise could have been accounted for by respectable witnesses, householders, two of whom met Mrs. Graham,

and the other came up in the course of finding them. Having been deprived of our witnesses we are sold, were it not for the honour of these gentlemen that are to judge of the whole matter, they are men of honour, they are men of virtue: our confidence therefore is in the Almighty God, and in them. You will please to recollect, that the date of the issuing of the first note is considerably before the procuring of the first stamps, therefore the impression on that note could not be the effect of the impression of that stamp; besides, upon a supposition that I had any hand in the matter, had it been necessary for me to make letters or y's, I could have done it with a pencil or a pen, and the jury will find that none of them do apply. Gentlemen, this is for the last stake of our lives; we are the parents of ten children, nine of whom are now alive, we therefore hope the jury will do us justice.
Jury to Alderson. What day did you receive the note?

Court. The prisoner is talking of a thing that has not been given in evidence.

Counsel for the prosecution. The note I was talking of was a note paid to her on the 27th of May. Hodgson was paid for the first letters on the 20th of May. The note given in evidence on this indictment was taken by Mr. Alderson on the 8th of June.

The Jury retired about 10 minutes, and brought in their verdict.

JOHN GRAHAM JANE GRAHAM

GUILTY , ( Death .)

(The attorney for the prisoners informed the Court after the VERDICT that when the witnesses came to him, and he had heard their story, he was well satisfied in his mind, that whatever they could prove with respect to the finding the notes was an absolute falsity; and that they were such witnesses as he never would introduce to any court, and the prisoners counsel said he advised him not to call any witnesses.

The prisoner Jane Graham was recommended to mercy by the Jury.

Tried by the second Middlesex Jury, before Mr. Justice Ashhurst.

*The British Newspaper Archive incorrectly gives the date as 10 August, incorrectly parsing the date "From Thursday August 8 to Thursday August 15, 1782."*

A Letter from Salisbury, dated Aug. 12, says,, "Saturday came on at the Castle of Winchester, the Trial of Mr. David Tyrie, of Gosport, for holding a treasonable Correspondence with the French Ministry. The Trial lasted near eight Hours, when he was convicted upon the clearest Evidence, and received Sentence to be executed at Portsmouth on the 24th Inst. When asked by the Clerk of Arraigns, what he had to say why Sentence of Death should not be pronounced upon him, he replyed, 'He did not suppose any Thing he could say would avail him, but he had a Hope beyond the Grave, and despised the Malice of bis Enemies.' He is about 30 Years of Age, by Birth a Scotchman, went up to London as a Servant, and lived with Mr. Vowell the Stationer, as a Clerk, above five Years, gaining the Esteem and Confidence of his Master."

Hampshire Chronicle - Monday 12 August 1782

WINCHESTER, Saturday, August 10.

At twelve o'clock on this day came one the tryal of David Tyrie, for High Treason, at the Castle of this city, before Justice Heath, under a special commission held for that purpose.

Previous to opening the cause, the prisoner begged permission of the Judge to state some reasons why his tryal should be postponed till the next Lent Assizes. These reasons were, that the short notice he had had of tryal, did not give him time to procure those witnesses on his behalf, from whose evidence he had no doubt of being acquitted. But it happened that one of them was now confined Tothillfields-Bridewell, and he had not the means to procure an Habeas Corpus to bring her down. Another witness was on a cruise, on board one of his Majesty's ships of war.– One was at this time at Brussells, and another at Ostend. He therefore prayed the indulgence of the Court to put off his tryal till the next assizes, in order to give him time to collect these witnesses, and prepare himself for tryal. After the Judge and counsel had investigated the matter, the motion was over-ruled, on its appearing that the prisoner had not hitherto made use of any endeavours to procure this evidence, though he had been six months in custody.

The cause was then opened on the part of the crown by Mr. Morris, who in a very able, humane, and comprehensive detail of the grounds of the prosecution, begged leave to call the attention of the Jury to the circumstances of an offence big with every fatal consequence to society, and destructive to the good government and well-being of a great and commercial nation.

The first witness called, was a Mrs. Harvey, who keeps a School near Scotland-yard, London.—She deposed that a Mrs. Askew, understood to be the wife of the prisoner, brought to her house on the 13th of Feb. last, a bundle of papers, requesting her to take particular care of them, and not on any account to let any person see them—struck with the singularity of the circumstance, and the tremour and anxiety of Mrs. Askew, she was induced, after her departure, to examine the papers, and finding them of a very particular nature, she carried them the same evening to a Mr. Page, a friend hers, to desire he would examine them, and let her know his opinion of their contents.

Mr. Page was then sworn— He confirmed the evidence of Mrs. Hervey *[sic]*, and said, that on finding the papers of a treasonable nature, he went the next morning and placed a constable at Mrs. Harvey's, to take the person into custody who should come to enquire for them— By this means Mrs. Askew, alias Mrs. Tyrie, was taken into custody; and after a few days search, Tyrie himself was also apprehended. By these papers it appeared that Tyrie had been at very great pains in collecting lists of all the English ships war in and out of commission; their different situations and appointments; their present and intended stations; number of Ships building, and under repair, in all the different dock-yards, and merchants yards in the kingdom, all drawn out in the hand writing of the prisoner, which was proved by two witnesses.

A Captain James was then sworn, who deposed, that in February last he met Tyrie, the prisoner, on the beach at Gosport, who, after some conversation, hired him to go to a port in France, at a premium of 15 guineas, to bring home a cargo of wines. That he met Tyrie and his wife by appointment at the Crown Inn at Gosport the same evening, where he finally engaged to undertake the voyage, and received a packet from Tyrie, which he was to deliver at Cherbourg, or Boulogne, which ever port he could soonest make. The packet, he said, was made up and sealed in his presence by Tyrie, at the Crown, and was directed and delivered by the prisoner into his own hand. That when he awoke the next morning, and considered the agreement he had made, he thought it had a very suspicious appearance, and went to an acquaintance of his, a Capt. Harrison, at Portsmouth, and related the circumstance, producing the packet, and expressing his dislike to undertake the voyage.

Capt. Harrison was then examined. He confirmed the testimony of Mr. James, and deposed, that when he received the packet out of his hand, and observed the direction to the Commandant at Cherbourg, he concluded there was treachery somewhere, and therefore broke open the letter; when being confirmed in his opinion, he set off immediately for London, and delivered the packet to Mr. Frazer, then Secretary at Lord Stormont's Office, where it remained till the prsioner was ordered for trial.

Mr. Frazer was then sworn. He proved the receipt of the packet from the hand of Capt. Harrison, and deposed that the packet thus produced in Court was identically the same delivered by Harrison; and James proved it be the same as he had received from Tyrie, and had delivered to Harrison. The contents of the packet were next examined, and found to contain five letters, one which, to the Commandant at Cherbourg, set forth and specified by name a squadron of English ships, just then sent over to hover on the French coast, to intercept a fleet of victuallers and merchantmen expected to sail from Cherbourg, and to rendezvous off La Hogue. Another letter the Minister of Marine at Paris, contained the most comprehensive account of the sailing the East and West India fleets from Spithead, in February last, with the names of all the men of war appointed to convoy them. With a variety of other particulars relative to the sailing and stations of a variety of ships, then under orders on different services.—Thus, after a most fair and candid trial, which lasted near eight hours, the Jury, without hesitation, on the clearest evidence, brought in their verdict, GUILTY.

On the verdict being notified to the prisoner, he was asked if he had any reason to shew why the sentence of the law should not be inflicted, as in all cases of the kind? He replied, That it was totally unnecessary for him to say any thing, since it had been put out of his power to provide those witnesses who would have proved his innocence—but he had a hope beyond the grave, and he despised all that this world could to him!

The Judge then, after a most pathetic and moving charge, passed the following sentence upon the prisoner,— "That you be taken to the place from whence you came, and from thence drawn upon hurdle to the place of execution; you are there to be hung by the neck, but not till you are dead; your privy-member shall be cut off, and your bowels taken out while yet alive, and burnt before your face; your head shall severed from your body, and your body divided into four quarters, and disposed as his Majesty shall think fit; and the Lord have mercy on your soul."

The Judge was pleased to order that he should be executed on Saturday the 24th of August instant, PORTSMOUTH.

We hear, that the prisoner had found means to conceal a razor, with which, after his condemnation, he attempted to destroy himself, but was fortunately prevented.

The above important TRIAL will be published at LARGE, in the course of a few days, by J. WILKES, at the Printing Office in Winchester, and may be had of the Booksellers in Portsmouth and Gosport, and of the other Agents for this paper.

COUNTRY NEWS. Salisbury, August 12.

Saturday came on at the Castle at Winchester, the trial of Mr. David Tyrie, Gosport, for holding treasonable correspondence with the French. The trial, began about twelve o'clock at noon, and lasted till near eight o'clock at night, when upon the clearest evidence he was convicted of the offence, and received sentence to be executed at Portsmouth the 24th instant. A great number papers were produced in the handwriting of the prisoner and a woman he lived with, which had been deposited with a Gentleman, who delivered them up to Government; and a packet was intercepted which he had delivered to the Captain of a swift-sailing vessel to carry either to Bologn or Cherbourg, which ever port he could best make, to be delivered to the Commandant, to be forwarded with all dispatch to the Minister of the Marine at Paris. The papers contained accurate accounts of all the navy of Great Britain, both in and out of commission—a copy from the weekly returns to the Navy Office from the several Dock-yards, of the progress made in the building and repairing the Royal Navy—authentic accounts of the destination of our fleets and cruisers—a proposal to furnish the French Ministry,for the sum of 700*l.*. with our signals—a plan for obtaining intelligence from all the Boards and Offices of Government, by bribing a Clerk in each Office, with the exact sum required to accomplish such corruption—and a proposal to fix Spies at Portsmouth and Plymouth, to obtain intelligence of the operations our fleets. He appears to be a mast artful, indefatigable, and enterprising man. During the trial he wrote a great number of notes to his Counsel, of questions which he wished to put to the witnesses, and was astonishingly collected in his mind throughout the whole. After conviction, when he was asked by the Clerk of Arraigns, what he had to say why sentence of death should not pronounced upon him, he replied, "He did not suppose any thing he could say would avail him, but he had a hope beyond the grave, and despised the malice of his enemies." He is a likely man, about 30 years age.

Tyrie is by birth a Scotchman, went to London as a servant, and lived with Mr. Vowell the Stationer, as a Clerk, above five years, gaining the esteem and confidence of his Master: He afterwards entered into business in the mercantile life, and had his integrity been equal to his abilities, must have done very well. A few years since he offered himself a Candidate for Hindon, in this County, and afterwards, failing in his views of a Merchant, procured himself a place in the Navy-Office at Portsmouth, which led him to his last fatal employment.

GENUINE MEMOIRs OF JOHN GRAHAM, A.M.

THERE is no station in life, let it be ever so-elevated, that can secure men from misery and infamy, unless the fear of GOD is implanted in the mind, and virtue regulates every Part of the conduct. The actions of men are not to be  ascribed to Divine Providence as the primary cause, altho' inseparably connected with it in the event. Freedom of will is the distinguishing characteristic of human nature; and in its exertions points out the difference between men and the brute creation, who live by instinct. Fine natural abilities, improved by a liberal education, are to an unprincipled man the same as beauty to a prostitute. Both are objects of esteem and veneration while they continue in the paths of virtue, and both are forsaken and despised when vice becomes the predominant passions in the mind. The poor ignorant man goes through the world in safety, trusting in his integrity; while the learned scholar, who is a slave to vice, brings dishonour on his family, and ruin upon himself. Numerous instances of this nature occurs daily; but few perhaps equal to what we shall here present to the reader, in the following narrative.

TO DO

JOHN GRAHAM, was born in the county of Perth, in scotland, in 1734. His father was a. reputable farmer, and one of the elders of the parish where he lived; and this John being tas, only, son, he was designed for the ministry. During his early youth he made conliderable progress, in Latin and Greek, at the Grammar school, and became so familiarly acquainted with the classic authors, that he was frequently consulted by learned. men in his neighbourhood, concerning disputed passages.

A rapid progress in learning generally

efiflears young men to those advanced in years, and often points out the road for their future progress through life, under such numerous advantages, that nothing less than some latent evil can prevent them from making a distin=

suishing __ :

In 1752 he was sent to the university of Glasgow; where, in the compass of one year, he went through a complete course of philological learning with so much applause, that he became the first of the class; for there were but few beauties, either in the Greek or Roman classics, but he could at any time turn to, without consulting the authors. The two subsequent years he spent in the study of logic and moral philosophy, under the celebrated Dr. smith, and soon after his father dying, he was under the necessity of leaving the university, without taking his degrees according t to the rules prescribed for students,

During these three years he was in the university, he spent his leisure hours in studying the polite arts, particularly music, in which he made more than ordinary progress. Being free and open in his conversation, his company
was much solicited by his fellow Audants;; and when he left the university, every one who knew him wished for his return; but his narrow and confined circumstances prevented him,

In 17 5, when he was only twenty-two years of age, he was obliged to accept of the Place of private tutor to the son of a gentleman in the south of scotiand, where he spent three years, and then accompanied his pupll to the university of Glasgow. When he arrived the second time at that learned seminary, his uncommon abilities began to display themselves in the most shining manner; and the learned Mr. Moore, then professor of greek, employed him during his leisure hours as an assistant. Patient and indefatigable in the difcharge of his duty, he continued at the university till his pupil had completed his studies, and along with him he took the dezree of Master of Arts. For his integrity in this service he received a confiderable gratuity, and was recommended to another family of rank, as a tutor to their son in the university of Edinburgh.

In 1760 Mr. Gzaham was eleted master of the grammar- school in the town of Kilmarnock, and along with it he enjoyed the place of precentor or clerk to 'the parish. In scotland the mastership of a-grammar-school is for life, and generally given to young probationers for the ministry; nor were the people deceived in the choice they had made of this unfortunate person.

Adorned with every qualification for a teacher, his school soon rose into considerable repute, and gentlemen of the first rank sent their sons to be educated by him; for his manner was engaging, and his pupils received his instructions from motives of love, rather than tear.

Being thus well settled in a reputable line of business, he turned his thoughts towards the married state, and paid his addresses to a young gentlewoman, the daughter of a reputable farmer near Douglas, in Lanerkshire. He obtained her consent, and that of her relations, and she is now the untortunate partner in his sufferings.

As his wife was of an engaging temper and affable disposition, the school continued to encrease; and Mr. Graham found his house filled with genteel boarders, some of w* were sons of gentlemen in America,

Mr. and Mrs. Graham lived in their native country in the most reputable manner till they had nine children; eight of whom, with one born since they came to London, are still alive. Children, who from their comely appearance and sweet temper, might be an ornament to any family in the world. But who can foresee future events? How many temptations are we daily surrounded by? Even the pleasant paths of virtue cannot at all times screen us from danger, unless we are continually upon our guard.

sometime in the year 1779, Mr, Graham unfortunately became acquainted with a miscreant fellow, an adventurer and sharper; who, under the pretence of being a man of fortune, cheated many industrious honest persons of their all. This fellow, whose name is H—r, failed for a considerable sum, and would have been punished for a cheat, had he not made his escape to London; and to finish our account of him, he was provided for in the Fast-India house by the interest of a certain Baronet.

No sooner was this fellow settled in London, than he began a correspondence with the unfortunate Graham, with whom he had some connections before; for it is certain Graham had assisted him in making his escape.

The import of the correspondence (for I have seen some of the letters) on H r's fide, consisted in pressing Graham to remove from Kilmarnock, and take a boarding-school near London; deceiving him by false representations of the advantages that could be obtained by embracing a proposal of such a flattering nature.

It is certain that Mr. Graham's connections with this fellow had done him no honour, for he had lost many of friends, nor was there one in Kilmarnock who had so much compassion for his family as to warn him to be upon his guard. A man of common sense would have told him, that to have succeeded in a boarding=school near London he must have left his native country in his youth; for when a man is advanced above forty years, and has spent all his time in his native country, he is very improper to settle among strangers, with whose manners and customs he 1s unacquainted,

But there are fatal periods when men will rush, for the hopes of gain, precipitately upon their own destruction. Under such infatuation 

??
he best advice, would signify: but little, and probably Mr. Graham would haye rejete.that Wt the best of his pre he me none left.

« "Litke- Muakicirh in RY fable, hat fancied himself already possessed of great riches, by being placed at the head of an English boarding school, and?? any evit hour he was. .over-Per=: snaded ro remove from a place where he was happily settled, and might have brought up his children useful members of society. TI&1 Ave

From an attcative consideration of the following circumstances, it will appear that Mr. Graham was far from being in a distressed situation at the time he formed the fatal resolve ??

of removing from Kilmarnock. He had so many books, and such a variety of houshold furniture, that he spent one whole week in selling them off by auction, for which he received a considerable sum. He then hired a coach, and set out with his wife, eight children, and one servant maid. Those who arevacquainted with travelling expences will be convinced, that to defray the whole during a Journey of upwards of four hundred miles, must be equal to what 1s s spent by some of our nobility and gentry

In August 1780, he arrived in London, and lived some weeks at the house of a brother-in-law, who kept a school near Mary-le-bone, The October following he took the boarding-school at Pancras-Wells, at which time there was not more than six scholars belonging to it, owing, it 1s was said, to the master's total unqualification for an undertaking, of that nature, Graham, however, trusting to his own abilities, without considering that even the most conspicuous merit is seldom rewarded, while ignorance and impudence is too frequently seen to reign In triumph.

Now it was that Graham began to know, by experience, what he had never sufficiently noticed before, viz. the necessary expences consequently attendant upon the proper management of an English boarding-school. However, having a very large family of his own, in order to a ?? with oeconomy, never engaged such respeRable servants for the management of his domestic affairs as might have turned both to his advantage and his reputation, but employed raw and inexperienced female servants of his own country, whose appearance in dress about his family was frequently too indelicate for English observers. Whether these circumstances arose from a parunl?? fondness to

is country we will leave the reader to judge; but the manner of cloathing his children in the Highland dress leaves us satisfied that our opinions were well founded in that particular,

But the most serious matter was Qlill in embrio, though it disclosed itself long before Mr. Graham was provided for it. The different tradesmen who had supplied his house with common necessaries, having sent in their bills made frequent applications for payment, but without effect, His creditors becoming exceeding clamorous, and being totally destitute of the proper means of discharging them, he was under the necessity of giving them several articles of his houshold furniture as a collateral security, to one of whom he gave an organ and six feather beds. Notwithstanding he bad found this temporary means of satisfying some of his tradesmen, two ations?? were commenced against him by versans from whom he had borrowed money; and although he procured bail, found himself so Kfarocably situated in his circumstances before he had been ten months at Pancras, that he formed the fatal resolution of committing a forgery upon the Bank of England, which he attempted by the following means: ruminating one day upon his distressed?? — ARTs he went into a house in the Rules of the Fleet Prison, where happening to enter into conversation with an engraver, he employed him to engrave a Ten Pound Bank Note. The engraver was a prisoner in the Fleet, and as it is well known that most of these gentry (to use their own expression) know how to err on the safe side, he took what money he could from Graham, and as soon as the piate was finished, in order to save his own neck, went and gave information to a city magistrate; upon which Graham was apprehended, and brought to his Trial at the Old-Bailey in October 1781; but none of the notes had been fluecd, he escaped with his life, and was only sentenced to six months imprisonment.

$o narrow an escape from a capital punishment it should have been thought would have for ever deterred him from such practices; but no sooner was he at liberty than he formed the desperate resolution of committing new for_ geries upon the Bank, upon a plan different from what he had ever practised before; into this fatal snare he led his wife, and made her a principal in his guilt; but there is too much reason to imagine she was fond of making appearanccs in a gay lite, without fear of the consequences attending such unwarrantable means for its support.

Instead of engraving plates for notes, he contrived to alter the value of genuine ones, by erasing the letters een out of a Fifteen Pound Bank note, and introducing a y in order to make them pass for a Fifty, which was executed in such an artful manner, that many of them were in circulation before any suspicions of the fraud arose. But as detection was to be apprehended in London, Graham and his wife having by this means procured plenty of money, set off into different parts of the country, and for some time they had grone?? success.

The method they used for circulating them was as follow: when they came to a large market town they put up at an inn, and Nits. Graham went with one of the notes to a silversmith's shop, where she purchased either a watch or some piece of plate, and paid for, at the lame time receiving the balance for a Fifty Pound Bank Note. In this manner they proceeded through several towns in different parts of the kingdom, and frequently returned to London to spend a few days along with their younger children, the three eldest having been placed at 2 boarding school near Guildford, in surry.

As they had some friends in London, and those of fair character, it is surprising that they never hinted their suspicions to them; for suspicions they mult have had, because hey knew that while Graham was a prisoner in Newgate for the first offence, his wite and children had subfisted on charity. But nothing of that nature was ever hinted so far as can be known, because their relations persist in denying their ever having had any suspicions; a circumstance which few will believe, were it even attested on oath, in the most solemn manner.

Their last journey was from London, through surry, Hampshire, and sussex, and notes were changed in every town through which they passed; but they had {ull a ROY in reWIyG

During the last assizes at Winchester, they put up at an inn in that city, and Mrs. Graham went to a watch-maker's shop, where she purchased a metal watch for fix guineas, and offered a Fifty pound note for change. The shopkeeper had not the money but went out to procure it, and fo regardless was she of deteQtion, that she gave him her direction, and he hevught the change to the 1 Inn.

They remained all night at the inn, and next morning Graham went to the castle to vist Tyrie, who was lately executed for high treason at Portsmouth. This was a fatal refohiten; but their career was now drawing to a close.

By this time some of the notes had hon Nopped at the Bank, and a general hue and cry had been raised to apprehend the persons who had published them. It does not appear that the suspicion had as yet fallen upon Grabam; for although his person was well known, yet hehad not passed any of them himself, having always made use of his wife for that purpose; and as she had never visited him while he was in confinement, so persons had not any suspicions of her. Indeed she appearcd in such an elegant stile of dress, that it was no difficult matter for her to carry on the deception; for what country shopkeeper would suspe a lady who travelled ia her post chaise, and spent her money as if she was a woman of fashion. Nor did she ever change her name; she always f1zned?? it at large on the notes before she passed hem??, an act in itself so artful, that although for some time it might pass unnoticed, yet it served to fix the guilt upon her in the end,

'F is well own that during the assizes in the country most of the turnkeys belonging to the London prisons are there; and as Graham was well known, a Mr. Wright, belonging to Tothill-Fields bridewell, knew him as he returned. from vititing Tyrie in the castle. He followed him home to the inn, where he charged both him and his wife with the forgery, and they were committed to prison. People were sent down to examine them, and they were brought to London by writ of habeas corpus. Graham was lodged in Newgate, among the common felons, but his wife was kept in New Prison at the expence of the Bank, who allowed her two gumeas per week till the trial,

During the first weeks of their confinement, they flattered themselves that they would be acquitted, because Graham had never been seen in the forgery; and his wife sheltered herself under the supposition that she would be acquitted because she had ated by her husband's directions. Nay so confident was she of this, that she sent to scotland for the certificate of her marriage. However, it turned out the reverse, for the jury found them both guilty, and they received sentence of death, only that Mrs. Graham was recommended to Mercy. During which rather injured them, as there was no postibility of acquiting them of the guilt.

Genuine Account of the Proceedings upon the Trial.

THE Inditment set forth that JOHN GRAHAM and JANE his Wife stood charged with having on the 8th day of June last, at the Parish of st. Margaret's, Westminster, having in their possession a certain Bank Note, No. K. 87. signed John Benet, entered W. Rawlins, for the. sum of 15*l.* did feloniously alter the same, by obliterating and defacing the letters e, e, n, and falsely forging and counterfeiting the letter y in two places in the said Bank Note, whereby the 1aid Bank Note did become, Import, and fignify 501. with intent to defraud the Go- vernor and Company of the Bank of England. : second Count charging it with intent to defraud Vary

Boucher and: Christopher Alderson. Third Count for feloniously uttering and publishing the said note, knowing it to be ge and altered with intent to defraud.

(The prisoner John objected to the indiment as having an error in it, his wife's name being Janet instead of Jane; but he was informed by the court, that having pleaded in chief he could not plead in abatement, but that if he had not pleaded, the privilege would only have been momentary, as another indictment could hays immediately been preferred)

Mr. Fielding stated the indictment, and Mr. Howarth, counsel for the crown, opened the case to the jury in the following manner: Gentlemen, I am counsel against the two prisoners, who stand charged with forging and altering a bank note, and with disposing and putting off

hat bank. note so forged and altered, knowing of its being forged and counterfeited. The policy of the law, in order to correct a mischief so extremely injurious to the. public credit, has made each of those offences a capital felony; it will be the object therefore of your inquiry, to judge from evidence whether both of them, or each of them, have committed either of these offences imputed to them in the indictment: perhaps in defence of the prisoner Jane Graham, it may be argued she is a married woman, and charged as the wife of the prisoner John, therefore intitled, in point of law, to some privilege which will protect her from the guilt of which she is charged. It behoves me to state to you sabje& to the correction of the court, what I conceive to be the law in that case; I take the extent of such rule, if there is any such rule laid down, is this, where a married woman, in company of her husband, commits a larceny, and nothing more appears than that she was in company of her husband, at the commission of that offence, there a presumption is raised from the humanity of the law, to suppose, that the woman committed that offence under the dominion and authority of her husband; but that, as well as any other presumption, can only stand till there is a proof to the contrary; for l take it to be equally clear, that if from the evidence it should appear, that the married woman was the active person, and acted without the controul or interference of her husband, it would be clear in point of law, that she was involved in the fame degree of guilt; if it should appear, that it was not in the presence of the husband but distin&t from him, I take it to be clear, that a woman in that fituation has no privilege whatever; this I conceive is the law on the subjet; the forgery now charged on the prisoner is, that of altering a bank note which originally issued trom the bank, a bank note of 15*l.* and by that alteration producing the operation and effect of a note of 5cl. th

manner in which that has been effected has been this ?? it has been contrived by some method or another, to discharge the double ee, and n, from the word fifteen, both in the body of the note and the black letters of the note, and to substitute in their place the letter y, by Which these two words appear fo be fifty, the fraud on the public is just that sum between fifteen and fifty; I shall late to you very shortly what will be the evidence that will be laid before you, in order to satisfy you that the prisoners have been gulty of that offence, The prisoner has stated, that from the number of counsel who appear against him, he has some reason to be alarmed; I would ease him of that fear, because every body knows, that the only use that is at this time of day made of counsel in criminal prosecutions, is merely to state, with a little more accuracy, the facts, in order to shew immediately their connection to each other, and to disentangle them from that degree of obscurity which they would receive coming irregularly from the mouths of witnesses; on that they are to draw their own conclusions, and to form their own judgment, therefore, I trust, the prisoner will be eased of any alarm of that sort; I shall discharge my duty simply in stating that evidence, and you will draw the conclusions.

The prisoner, John Graham, was in April last discharged from confinement; his cir??? called Jane Graham, his wife; they have, I believe, a large family of children; immediately upon his discharge, he had formed this scheme, which I am sorry to fay, had been in his contemplation some time before, In his judgment, this mode of traud upon tae public was the most easily effected: it being neceffary in order to carry it into execution, that he should be furnished with letters of different sorts, in order to complete his Wore; : for that purpose he applied himself to a Mr. Rayner, who was foreman to a Mr, Caslon, who is famous in this town as an engraver; Caflon recommended him to Mr. Hodgson, who is an engraver on wood, and stated to be a person very likely to furnish him with such letters as he should want. On the 8th of May the prisoner, John Grabam, . applied to Hodgson to. have the letter y cut for him, to produce the effect of white- on a black ground, so as to resemble the letters on the bottom of a bank-note; Hodgson said it is not likely to produce the effec, for you must have a little printers ink, and that will daub the books. The prtToner said they were for a whimsical gentleman, and accordingly they were cut for him; he called and paid Hodgson for them, and took them away;, some time after he called again, and said these letters did not quite answer his purpose, and said he wanted some numbers,

as 2,3, 5, 20, JO, and 10 on : respecting the letter y, I shall produce to: you the papers marked by the prisoner, and the alterations he withed to be made respecting the letter y; a number of letters were cut and figures made by Mr. Hudgson, which were called for and took away by the prisoner Jane, the wife, When you inspect the tetter y upon the note produced to you, and compare it with the letter?? y produced to you, and the copy of that Hodgson has engraved, supported by Hodgson's evidence, it will appear to you beyond doubt, that the alteration and forgery in this bank-note, was made by means of this Jetter engrazed by Hodgson, under the direction and order of the prisoner; and allo that the prisoner John tk away and had possession of this etter; shortly affer this we find thele notes so altered and put 1n circulation; here there appears to be considerable art in John. In no one instance is he to be connected with the putting off these notes; the whole of that is left to the conduct and management of the woman; and there is no instance in which he can be connected. with the putting off any of these notes. On the 8th of June, the note was put off by the prisoner Jane; the went to the shop of 2 Mr. Alderson, silk-Mercer, in Bridge street, Westminster, where after having bargained for some things, she put off to him one of the forged notes, altered from 15*l.* to col. that note will be traced very accurately, so as to leave no doubt, and

rought home to the prisoner Jane, negociated by her; in 2 very few days atter it was di{covered this note was

a forgery; and upon taking it to the Bank, it was found that a note of that letter, No. and date, had been issued of 15*l.* but none of 50*l.* consequently from that circumstance, without more, they were perfectly satisfied that this was a forged note. There could be no such note issued from the Bank; the inattention of the persons taking the note is wonderful, as there is such a?? space between the letter y and the pounys, that they must with a little attention have leea it : this caused an alarm as you may easily conceive, and the officers of the Bank, in endeavonring to trace the offender, had discovered that the pritoner had been observed to be full of money, and putting off notes, and buying goods;

but though the most diligent search was gory fr him, he was difcovered by accident. A Mr.

fortinately saw the two prisoners alight out of a post-chaise at Winchester, and they were apprehended at southampton, It will be unnecessary for me to state ro. ?? you the number of notes, but I have proof it amounted to eight, as appears by the confession of the pritoner Jane on her examination, On the morning of their being apprehended at southampton, their trunk was onened and searched, on searching that, the sum of ninety and odd guineas, and a 15l. bank-note was found; the money in the trunk, the 15*l.* note in the pocket of the prisoner. In that trunk was also found a great number of experiments on thin paper, made to imitate bank-paper, with letters of this kind of ground, and the impression of the stamps cut by Hodgson the engraver; also a box of paste, and a little brush, for the purpose of pasting letters on, when the letters e e 7 were discharged from the real bank-note; they then pasted a thin letter y on this paper in their place; then they pasted a bit of thin paper as it it had been worn by carriage, On John was found a 15*l.* bank-note, on which, as it is stated to me, an attempt had been made to discharge the letters een in the body of the note, and it did not quite succeed; the paper seemed to have suffered in the operation, and be made very thin; in the back of that note are figures cast up for the purpote of hiding the operation, which' appears to be cut exactiy in the same manner as these circulated by the woman, From these circumstances you will draw what conclusions you think fit. This will be the nature of the evidence laid before you; on this evidence, in the first place, it will appear clear that there has been a forgery on the bank-note committed by somebody; The question then is, By whom is that forgery committed? In order to satisty you that the forgery was committed by the prisoners, or at least by one of them, you shall have the evidence. of Hodgson, who will state to you that the prisoner was put by him in possesion of letters capable ot effecting that alteration; and that that alteration was effected by means of these letters you cannot doubt, whon I produce to you the pieces of paper in black and white, found in the box of the prisoners, in which these corresponding letters are found to be marked; I conceive that no doubts can remain that the forgery was occasioned by these letters, and by the possessor of these letters. Crimes of this sort are always committed in secret, where there is no eye to see; we can only judge of them by probability. The forgery is as capable of commission by the woman as the man: there is no greater degree of ingenuity or art in this forgery, when you are in possession of the instruments that will make the letters, than to paste with great neatness the letter y where the letters e en stood before. With respe&t to the other offence, the dispoling and uttering these notes, you will observe, there 1s no evidence against John, except his being in company with this woman, standing to him in the relation of wite, having col:abited together as man and wife far many years, and going together to southampton 3 you are to judge whether he is not to be connected with her in the crime of disposing of these notes. Gentlemen, these. are the circumstances of this case, which 1 shall leave with you. 1 shall call my witneffes, and I trust, when you have heard them, you will be convinced, that the priloners are both of them guilty of the offence charged jn the indictment. THOMAs HODGsON, Printer and Wood-cutter, in George's Court, Clerkenwell, was the first evidence sworn. He recolleed the prisoner John Graham calling upon hn some time in May Jast, to. get two letters cut 

wood; he told the witness they were for »® whimsical gentleman in the country, to mark his books where the authors names ended with a y : he likewise said the gentleman would want some figures, as 1, 2, 3, 4. He cut

- the two letters, and was paid 1s. each for them; also the numbers to the amount of 20, (and made proofs of them) for which he had 2s. each. A paper with proofs being shewn the witness, said they were made with his own hand, and the pritoner had them from him. some time after he came again with freih direQions, but some uacertainty having arisen which way the tails of the y's were to be turnea, he s4id he would write to the gentleman, and defired the witness would leave them unfinished, and said he would call in two or thresUays, which he did, and gave orders for finishing them; he {aid his servant should call for them, being obliged to be out of town himself : a woman did call for them, which was the prisoner at the bar. ne re ge

Mr. ALDERsON, a Mercer, in Bridge-street, Westminster, recolleted Jane Graham, 'the prisoner at the bar, coming to his house on the 8th of June, about seven o'clock in the evening, and desired to see some quilted

sattin coats, which were shewn to her, and she fixed upon one; she said she had a bank bill of 50l. to change, and shewed it him; he said he would change it; the then desfred to see some silks, and fixed on one. The goods came to 6*l.* 12*s.* he changed the note, and gave For two 15*l.* notes, and the remainder in cath,

When he came to London, he mentioned to his master, the governor of Tothill-fields Bridewell, where he had seen them, and had orders to go in pursuit of them. They were apprehended at the Coach and Horses in southampton; Mrs, Graham was searche

of stairs in a bed-room; which Mrs. Graham had the key of in her pocket, - When the trunk was opened, he tound a little gai{ipot of paste, a paper with 69 WTR bs and 2 half guineas, some paper apd some stamps; she was very desirous to put her: hand in, but was prevented, There was a great deal of wearing apparel in the trunk, ' which was claimed by Mr.'Graham, with 'the money. / ' The PRISONERS being called upon for their defence, she said, My lord, and gentlemen of the jury: we had ieyen witnesses here this day, who, would have spoken to many particulars that would have sufficiently have proved our innocence; of these witnesses we are deprivedy but by what means I cannot comprehend; they were a short time ago in the lord-mayor's parlour, and were seen by Mr. Wilson; lince which they have all” go been ordered to go away, contrary to our knowledge; they would have proved the meaning of the stamps, T'' had a commission to procure them for a gentleman. in Thames-street, to be sent to a Mr. O'Hara, of Dublin,

Gentlemen, this is for the 1ait take of our lives; we are the parents of ten children, nine of whom are now alive, we therefore hope the jury will do us justice, The jury after being out 10 Minutes brought them in MEs Both Guilty, DEATH. Es The Attorney for the Prisoner informed the Court, AFTER THE  Verdict, that when the Witnesses came to him, and he had heard their tory, he was well satisfied in his mind, that whatever they could prove with respe& to finding the notes was an absolute fallity; and that they were such witnesses as he would never 1ptroduce to any court and the prisoners counie said he advised him notf  any witnesses
