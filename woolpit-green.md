# The Green Children of Woolpit

I don't know if any of you are familiar with James Stephens' fabulous Irish Fairy Tales, which I have in the form of a green covered paperback book? It retells many old Irish legends that date back between 500 and 1000 years when they were first written down, although many of them also continued going strong in the oral tradition. One of them, Mongan's Frenzy, a tale that is too long for me to tell in its entirety just here, tells in part of a campaign that Mongan, a King of Ireland, waged on the King of Lochlann, the King of the men of the North, of the Norsemen, of the Vikings. One battle in particular did not go well for Mongan, because the King of Lochlann released a terrible, terrible weapon, a truly horrific thing, against the Irishmen; a weapon so effective that Mongan lost many of his men that day: a flock of venomous sheep. Sheep so vicious that the Irishmen could only escape them by climbing trees. And then wait for help come.

It's true... It really happened...

Now, that is not the story I'm going to tell here, but I was reminded of it when I came across this story. A story from the town of Woolpit, in Suffolk. Now when I first heard that main — Woolpit — I wondered where it came from, how had the town got that name? I wondered if perhaps, in times past, the King of Lochlann had invaded Suffolk, along the windswept shores of East Anglian, and brought with him a flock of venomous sheep, like some sort of Dark Ages tank division, and ravaged the Suffolk plains with it. And that perhaps the good people of one of the villages thereabouts, not having any trees to climb, had hit upon the cunning plan of digging pits that the venomous sheep might fall into, like ancient tank traps.

Unfortunately, it seems that is *not* the origin of th name. Although it's not far off.

Because the town was, at least as far as far local Woolpit historians would have you believe, named after Ulfketel (or Ulfyctel), counsellor to Aithelred the Unready, and Lord of the Eastern Angles, Ulfketel, who had helped defend East Anglia against Danish attack in the early 11th century. Ulfketel, a name of Scandinavian origina: from ulf, meaning wolf, and ketel: trap, though I have elsewhere seen it translated as helmet, which might give rise to an Old English name such as Wulfhelm, or cauldron: Wolf's pot. There are so many ways you could take this!

Anyway, maybe the town was actually renowned for its wolf pits: pits dug on the outskirts of the town, baited with something fruity and fragrant, like a dead cow, and covered with branches. Attracted by the smell of fresh meat, a wolf would approach, then fall into the pit, and be unable to climb out because of the steep sides.

Now, you might be thinking that none of that has anything to do with "green". But you'd be wrong. Because once, long ago, in the county of Suffolk, in the town Woolpit, a strange thing happened one harvest time. The folk were out in the in the fields, gathering the harvest, when then saw two young children walking towards them, two young children, a boy an a girl, not from those parts. No-one recognised them; no-one could understand the strange language they spoke; no-one could take their eyes of the childrens' green skin.

The children wer taken to the Lord of the Manor — he would surly know what to do? They were famished, but would eat nothing: ...

De quodam puero et puella de terra emergentibus.

Aliud quoque mirum priori non dissimile in Suthfolke contigit apud Sanctam Mariam de Wulpetes. Inventus est puer quidam cum sorore sua ab accolis loci illius juxta oram cujusdam foveae quae ibidem continetur, qui formam omnium membrorum caeteris homini bus similem habebant, sed in colore cutis ab omnibus mortalibus nostrae habitabilis discrepabant. Nam tota superficies cutis eorum viridi colore tingebatur. Loque lam eorum nullus intelligere potuit. Hi igitur ad  domum domini Ricardi de Calne cujusdam militis, ad ducti prae admiratione, apud Wikes, inconsolabiliter flebant. Panis ac caetera cibaria eis apposita sunt, sed nullis escis quae eis apponebantur vesci volebant, cum utique maxima famis inedia diutius cruciarentur,quia omnia hujusmodi cibaria incomestibilia esse credebant, sicut puella postmodum confessa est. Tandem cum fabae noviter cum stipitibus abscissae in domo asportarentur, cum maxima aviditate innuerunt ut de fabis illis sibi daretur. Quae corameisallatae, stipites aperiunt, non fabarum folliculos, putantes in concavitate stipitum fabas contineri. Sed fabis in stipitibus non inventis, iterum flere coeperunt. Quod ubi astantes animadverterunt, folliculos aperiunt,fabas nudas ostendunt, ostensis cum magna hilaritate vescuntur, nulla alia cibaria ex multo tempore penitus contingentes. Puer vero semper quasi languore depressus infra breve tempus moritur. Puella vero sospitate continua perfruens, ac cibariis quibuslibet assuefacta, illum prassinum colorem penitus amisit, atque sanguineam habi tudinem totius corporis paulatim recuperavit. Quae postmodum sacri baptismatis lavacro regenerata, ac per multos annos in ministerio praedicti militis, (sicut ab eodem milite et ejus familia frequenter audivimus,) commorata, nimium lasciva et petulans exstitit. Interrogata vero frequenter de hominibus suae regionis, asserebat quod omnes habitatores et omnia quae in regione illa habebantur viridi tingerentur colore, et quod nullum solem cernebant, sed quadam claritate fruebantur, sicut post solis occasum contingit. Interrogata autem quomodo in hanc terram devenisset cum puero praedicto, respondit, quia cum pecora sequerentur, devenerunt in quandam cavernam. Quam ingressi, audierunt quendam delectabilem sonum campanarum ; cujus soni dulcedine capti per cavernam diutius errando incedebant, donec ad exitum illius devenirent. Qui inde emergentes, nimia claritate solis et insolita aeris temperie, quasi attoniti et exanimes effecti, diu super oram speluncae jacuerunt. Cumque a supervenientium inquie tudine terrerentur, diffugere voluerunt, sed introitum speluncae minime reperire potuerunt, donec ab eis comprehenderentur.

About a boy and a girl emerging from the earth.

Another wonder, not unlike the former, happened in Suthfolke at St. Mary of Wulpetes. A certain boy was found with his sister by the acolytes of that place near the edge of a certain pit which is contained there, who had the shape of all the other limbs of a man, but in the color of their skin they differed from all the mortals of our habitation. For the whole surface of their skin was dyed green. None of them could understand my speech. They therefore went to the house of a certain soldier, Lord Richard de Calne, when they were taken by surprise at Wikes, and wept inconsolably. Bread and other victuals were set before them, but they did not want to eat any of the food that was set before them, when of course they would be tormented by the greatest hunger and starvation for a longer time, because they believed that all such victuals were inedible, as the girl later confessed. At last, when the beans, freshly cut with the stalks, were brought into the house, they begged with the greatest eagerness that some of the beans should be given to them. Those that are browned open the stalks, not the pods of the beans, thinking that the beans are contained in the hollow of the stalk. But when the beans were not found in the piles, they began to cry again. When the bystanders noticed, they opened the pods, showed the naked beans, and ate them with great gaiety, having not touched any other food for a long time. But the child always dies, as if depressed by sickness, within a short time. But the girl, enjoying continued suspense, and having become accustomed to every kind of food, completely lost that purple color, and gradually recovered the blood-like disposition of her whole body. After being regenerated by the bath of holy baptism, and for many years in the service of the aforesaid soldier, (as we have often heard from the same soldier and his family), she was exceedingly lascivious and mischievous. But when she was frequently questioned about the people of her country, she asserted that all the inhabitants and everything that was in that country were dyed green, and that they saw no sun, but enjoyed a certain brightness, as happens after the setting of the sun. When she was asked how she had come to this land with the aforesaid boy, she answered that when they were following the cattle, they came to a certain cave. As soon as they entered, they heard a certain pleasing sound of bells; captivated by the sweetness of its sounds, they wandered on through the cave for a longer time, until they came to its exit. Those emerging from thence, by the excessive brightness of the sun and the unusual temperature of the air, as if stunned and lifeless, lay for a long time on the edge of the cave. And when they were frightened by the restless noise of those who came, they wanted to flee, but they could not at all find the entrance to the cave, until they were seized by them.

The History of William of Newburgh
By William (of Newburgh) · 1856

PREFACE TO WILLIAM OF NEWBURGH.

1. NEARLY all the scanty information which we possess respecting the biography of William of Newborough, —the author of the history which occupies the larger portion of the present volume, -is derived from his own writings. The earlier bibliographers, indeed, add a few details, which, although unsupported by collateral authority, are here incorporated with the more trustworthy notices
gleaned from the author's own statements.

2. Leland, followed by Bale and others, tell us that his family name was Pettit, or Parvus, and that he was born at Bridlington, in Yorkshire. He himself records the date of his birth, which took place in the first year of the reign of king Stephen ; consequently, in the few last days of December, 1135, or in 1136. In his Prefatory Epistle, he describes himself as " William, a canon of Newborough, ❞—a priory of Black or Augustine monks, —which he appears¹ to have entered shortly after it was founded by Roger de Moubray, in 1145.2 Here he probably spent the whole of his life. He is said to have died in the year 1208, aged seventy-two. For this date no satisfactory authority is vouched ; and, until such is produced, its accuracy may be considered questionable, —if we consider how improbable it is that the author, who had chronicled with such minuteness of detail the earlier exploits of king Richard, should have neglected to record the death of his sovereign, had he himself been alive at the period of its occurrence.

3. This history, which commences with the Norman conquest, in 1066, and ends in 1197, was undertaken at the request of Ernald, abbot of the neighbouring monastery of Rievaux, to whom, on its completion, it was dedicated by the author. ...

CHAP.XXVII.- OF THE GREEN CHILDREN.

NOR does it seem right to pass over an unheard of prodigy, which, as is well known,took place in England during the reign of king Stephen. Though it is asserted by many, yet I have long been in doubt concerning the matter, and deemed it ridiculous to give credit to a circumstance supported on no rational foundation, or at least one of a very mysterious character ; yet, at length I was so overwhelmed by the weight of so many and such competent witnesses,that I have been compelled to believe,and wonder over amatter,which I was unable to comprehend,or unravel, by any powers of intellect.

In East Anglia there is a village, distant, as it is said, four or five miles from the noble monastery of the blessed king and martyr, Edmund `[Bury St.Edmunds,in Suffolk.]`; near this place are seen some very ancient cavities, called Wolfpittes," that is, in English, " Pits for wolves," and which give their name to the adjacent village. `[Wulpet, a market town, concerning which,see Camden's Brit. col. 443, who mentions this story from Newburgh. Ralph of Coggeshall, (cited by Picard in his notes upon this passage,) mentions this occurrence, but refers it to the reign of Henry II. He derived his information, as he states, from Sir Richard de Calne, in whose house these children resided.]` During harvest, while the reapers were employed in gathering in the produce ofthe fields,two children,a boy and a girl, completely green in their persons and clad in garments of a strange colour, and unknown materials, emerged from these excavations. While wandering through the fields in astonishment,they were seized by the reapers, and conducted to the village, and many persons coming to see so novel a sight,they were kept some days without food. But, when they were nearly exhausted with hunger, and yet could relish no species of support which was offered to them, it happened,that some beans were brought in from the field,which they immediately seized with avidity, and examined the stalk for the pulse, but not finding it in the hollow of the stalk, they wept bitterly.

Upon this, one of the bystanders, taking the beans from the pods, offered themtothechildren,who seizedthem directly, and ate them with pleasure. By this food they were supported for many months, until they learnt the use of bread. At length, by degrees, they changed their original colour, through the natural effect of our food, and became like ourselves,and also learnt our language. It seemed fitting to certain discreet persons that they should receive the sacrament of baptism, which was administered accordingly. The boy,who appeared to be the younger, surviving his baptism but a little time, died prematurely; his sister, however, continued in good health, and differed not in the least from the women of our own country. Afterwards, as it is reported, she was married at Lynne, and was living a few years since, at least, so they say. Moreover, after they had acquired our language, on being asked who and whence they were,they are said to have replied, " We are inhabitants of the land of St. Martin, who is regarded with peculiar veneration in the country which gave us birth." Being further asked where that land was, and how they came thence hither, they answered, "We are ignorant of both those circumstances; we only remember this,that on a certain day,when we were feeding our father's flocks in the fields, we heard a great sound, such as we are now accustomed to hear at St. Edmund's, when the bells are chiming; and whilst listening to the sound in admiration, we became on a sudden, as it were, entranced, and found ourselves among you in the fields where you were reaping." Being questioned whether in that land they believed in Christ, or whether the sun arose, they replied that the country was Christian, and possessed churches; but said they, " The sun does not rise upon our countrymen ; our land is little cheered by its beams ; we are contented with that twilight, which, among you, precedes the sun-rise, or follows the sun-set. Moreover, a certain luminous country is seen, not far distant from ours, and divided from it by a very considerable river." These,and many other matters, too numerous to particularize, they are said to have recounted to curious inquirers. Let every one say as he pleases, and reason on such matters according to his abilities; I feel no regret at having recorded an event so prodigious and miraculous.
