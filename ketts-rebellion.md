Gallows Justice

We fought back in the year of the famine  
Revenge on the rich by the poor  
The sake of our lands, and our loved ones,  
Our rights to live upon these shores.

Well this is the land of our fathers  
We worked the land with blood, sweat and tears  
Our kindred are buried all around us  
We have loved the land, with the turning of the years

I will dance the jig of death in the morning  
I will fight for the right to be free  
Well, I'll dance the jig of death in the morning  
As they hang me from the Gallows Tree

Fitzherbert and his troopers came a-calling  
To cast us out like vermin in the night  
And I watched as my homestead burning around me  
But I won't give up my lands without a fight.

Well I damn you to hell my Lord Fitzherbert  
As the bastard who would drive us from the land  
And I swear on this day for retribution  
There comes a time when a man must make a stand

I will dance the jig of death in the morning  
I will fight for the right to be free  
Well I'll dance the jig of death in the morning  
As they hang me from the Gallow's Tree

I like to tell Fitzherbert came in distance,
My pistol hanging silent by my side  
So let this be a lesson tyrant landlord  
As my bullet hit him right between the eyes.

So now as I'm stand beneath the Gallow's  
And I gaze up in defiance to the sky  
Well I'll meet you down in hell my Lord Fitzherbert,  
For my honour and my freedom I must die

I will dance the jig of death in the morning  
I will fight for the right to be free  
Well, I'll dance the jig of death in the morning  
As they hang me from the Gallow's Tree

Fight, fight and die for the honour to be free  
We'll fight, fight and die for the honour to be free  
We'll fight, fight and die for the honour to be free  
Well I'll fight, fight and die for the honour to be free  
Hey

CHAP. II,

Chronology of Remarkable Events from the Reformation to the Death of Queen Anne.

...


This year broke out the rebellion in Norfolk, called Kett's Rebellion; which first originated in the opposition made by the lower class of inhabitants of several villages in the neighbourhood of Attleburgh and Wymondham, to the inclosure of the commons and waste lands, by several proprietors of large estates, by which the poor and indigent people conceived themselves to be greatly injured. On the 7th of July the insurgents chose Robert Kett, a tanner, and his brother, William Kett, a butcher, both of Wymondham, to be their leaders or captains, and under their command marched to Norwjgfrj and encamped without Bishop's gate, on Mousehold heath. Having taken possession of the palace of the earl of Surrey, and of St. Michael's chapel (ever since called Kett's castle), they destroyed every thing which they could find there, and proceeded to lay siege to the city. These rebels stiled themselves the king's friends and deputies, and held a pretended court of judicature, at which Robert Kett presided, under the branches of a spreading tree, which they called the Oak of Reformation. Their numbers being increased to 16,000, and their camp strongly fortified and well supplied with ammunition and provision, they summoned the city to surrender, and commanded Thomas Codde, the mayor, to deliver up the government of the city, which this worthy citizen stoutly refused to do, declaring he would sooner part with his life. The rebels in the mean time took many gentlemen prisoners, and extorted large sums of money and stores of provision from the inhabitants, and many of the lower sort joined them, so that their numbers quickly increased to 20,000; who, though they could not agree among' themselves, nor preserve any degree of subordination in the camp, treated their prisoners with the most wanton cruelty, and executed many of them because they were gentlemen. Complaint being made to king Edward VI. he sent a herald, commanding them to lay down their arms, and promising them pardon if they did so ; but this they positively refused, and carried on the siege with greater vigour than before. They made an attack on Bishop's gate, where they were bravely repelled by the citizens, till some of them passed the river, beat off the guard from the gate, and opened that passage for their whole force ; they seized the mayor and many of the citizens, put them in irons, conveyed them as prisoners to their camp, and took from the citizens all kind of forage and provision they stood in need of.

The king, in council, finding by the return of the herald that the rebels were not inclined to abandon the siege, sent the marquis of Northampton, with a strong force, who was gladly received by the citizens. The night after their arrival, the rebels made another furious assault upon the city, which many of them entered, but were forced to retreat ; having lost 300 men in I he engagement, they retired to their camp. The next day, being the first of August, they crossed the river by the hospital, and a terrible engagement commenced between them and the marquis's force, on St. Martin's plain, where many were killed on both sides ; among whom was the much-lamented lord Sheffield, who was? murdered with a club. The rebels broke into the city on every side, ami by their numbers obliged the marquis with his force* to retire. Upon his retreat they fired the city in many places. Whole streets were entirely consumed ; and if a heavy rain had not providentially fallen, the city would have probably been reduced to ashes. During the fire the citizens were plundered by the rebels of every thing' valuable.

This miserable state of affairs prevailed till fresh succour arrived from the king, who sent John Dudley, earl of Warwick, accompanied by some of the first generals, They arrived on the 23d of August, when Kett having assumed the government., the earl sent Norroy, king at arms, to demand him to surrender it to the king's forces. Kett obliged alderman Steward and alderman Rugge to go and learn the earl's pleasure ; who told them, that unless they immediately opened their gates, they would be declared traitors, and punished as such. The citizens assured the king at arms, that nothing could be further from their intentions than favouring the rebels ; that they had done all in their power to keep the citizens in good order and dutiful obedience ; and that they hoped the earl would pardon the deluded followers of Kett, if they would submit to die king's forces, and thereby stop the further effusion of blood. The earl on being informed of this, and fearing for thee fate of those gentlemen whom the rebels had detained in prison, sent the king at arms with a herald, to offer to the rebels a general pardon, on condition of laying down their arms -and returning to their allegiance. This had no effect. The rebels insulted the officers. The earl of Warwick immediately stormed the city, and breaking down the wall in many places on the west side, he -entered it with his troops, sword in hand, and took possession. The rebels made an obstinate resistance, but at last were forced to give way, leaving 130 dead on the spot. A detachment of the rebels, in the mean time, took possession of the earl's baggage and ammunition, which he had advanced, intending to storm the camp on the morrow. The guard not being strong enough for their protection, was obliged to give way, and leave them in the the enemy's possession, the king's master gunuer being killed in the skirmish. The rebels having now a fresh supply of ball and powder, began a severe cannonade upon the city, and did considerable damage, and would have done much more, but for their want of skill in the management of artillery. The earl immediately barricaded the gates, and ordered White Friars* bridge to be broken down. Not withstandinghis precautions, the next day (Aug. 25; a large body of the rebels crossed the river at Conisford, and set fire to the houses in several places, so that great quantities of goods and two whole parishes were consumed. The earl'* forces bravely opposed the rebels, determining sooner to die than abandon the city.

The next day (Aug. 26) the earl, having received a reinforcement, marched out of the city to attack the rebels, but previously he again offered them the king's pardon, on condition of laying down their arms and returning to their allegiance. This gracious offer was unanimously rejected. The earl gave orders to engage, which the rebels perceiving, they placed all the gentlemen whom they had detained prisoners in the front of the battle, chained together, to the intent that they might fall by the swords of their friends ; but so prudently was the attack conducted by captain Drury, that most of them escaped. The king's standard bearer being killed by a cannon ball, enraged the earl, and he ordered a general discharge of his artillery to be made among the rebels, which so much disabled them as to render them an easy conquest to the horse, who coming in among them broke their ranks and put them to flight, More than 3500 of the rebels were killed, and a great number wounded in the pursuit.

There remained still another party entrenched, who seemed determined to hold out to the last extremity ; the earl therefore, to avoid the further effusion of blood, once more offered them pardon, on the same condition that he had done the others, which they said they were ready to accept, if they could be assured of their lives, but that they considered this message as only a stratagem to get them into the power of the earl, and to make them his prisoners ; upon receiving this answer, orders were given for the attack ; but before they were put in execution, the earl sent once more to know whether, if he came himself and assured them of pardon, they would submit. This they promised to do ; upon which, when the king at arms read the king's proclamation, the whole company of the rebels cried out " God save king Edward ;" and by this prudent and compassionate conduct much bloodshed was avoided.

The battle ended, the camp was given up to be plundered by the king's troops, who sold the toooty publicly in the market-place. Many brave officers and distinguished soldiers fell in the engagement. Kett was seized the next day at Swannington ; on which day the earl and other magistrates held a special assize at the castle, and the two Ketts and nine of the ringleaders were tried before them. They were all found guilty of treason and rebellion, and the two Ketts sent to the tower of London ; the other nine were carried to their old head quarters, the Oak of Reformation, upon which they were hanged up, and then presently cut down again, their bowels were pulled out and burned before their faces, their bodies beheaded and quartered, and their heads and quarters set up on poles on the tops of the towers and gates, as a terror to others ; thirty were executed in like manner at the gallows without Magdalen gate, forty at the gallows in the market-place, and many in other places, so that in the whole 300 suffered death.

Aug. 29 was celebrated as a day of public thanksgiving and praise to Almighty God, for the success of his Majesty's forces, in suppressing the late rebellion. The day was observed with ringing of bells and other demonstrations of gladness. At seven o'clock in the morning bishop Thirlby, with the mayor and corporation, attended divine service at St. Peter's Mancroft church ; and the day was for many years afterwards kept as an annual civic festival.

Robert and William Kett were tried at London for high treason and rebellion, and Nov. 29 they were delivered to Sir Ed. Windham, knight, high sheriff of the counties of Norfolk and Suffolk, to receive punishment. Robert was conveyed to this city, and being brought to the foot of the castle, was drawn up to a gibbet erected at the top, and there left hanging alive till he died by famine ; his body being entirely wasted, at length fell down. The like, sentence was executed upon William, who was suspended alive on the top of Wymondham steeple.
