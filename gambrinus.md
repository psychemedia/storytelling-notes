# Gambrinus, King of Beer

*As befits a bar, a tale about the invention of beer...*

If there's any particular kind of place in which you're likely hear people talking about "the King of Beer", it's probably in a bar. And if it's the beer speaking, it's no wonder that any tales told get misheard, mis-told, and misremembered, if not forgotten altogether by the morning after...

And so it is with tales of Gambrinus, the King of Beer. Here's one particular story that I heard tell of...




A summary is provided in John Fiske's *Myths And Mythmakers: Old Tales And Superstitions Interpreted By Comparative Mythology*, 1872, [p173-5](https://archive.org/details/mythsandmythmake003324mbp/page/n187/mode/2up)

> In the legend of Gambrinus, the fiend is still more ingloriously defeated. Gambrinus was a fiddler, who, being jilted by his sweetheart, went out into the woods to hang himself. As he was sitting on the bough, with the cord about his neck, preparatory to taking the fatal plunge, suddenly a tall man in a green coat appeared before him, and offered his services. He might become as wealthy as he liked, and make his sweetheart burst with vexation at her own folly, but in thirty years he must give up his soul to Beelzebub. The bargain was struck, for Gambrinus thought thirty years a long time to enjoy one's self in, and perhaps the Devil might get him in any event ; as well be hung for a sheep as for a lamb. Aided by Satan, he invented chiming bells and lager beer, for both of which achievements his name is held in grateful remembrance by the Teuton. No sooner had the Holy Roman Emperor quaffed a gallon or two of the new beverage than he made Gambrinus Duke of Brabant and Count of Flanders, and then it was the fiddler's turn to laugh at the discomfiture of his old sweetheart. Gambrinus kept clear of women, says the legend, and so lived in peace. For thirty years he sat beneath his belfry with the chimes, meditatively drinking beer with his nobles and burghers around him. Then Beelzebub sent Jocko, one of his imps, with orders to bring back Gambrinus before midnight. But Jocko was, like Swiveller's Marchioness, ignorant of the taste of beer, never having drunk of it even in a sip, and the Flemish *schoppen* were too much for him. He fell into a drunken sleep, and did not wake up until noon next day, at which he was so mortified that he had not the face to go back to hell at all. So Gambrinus lived on tranquilly for a century or two, and drank so much beer that he turned into a beer-barrel. `[See Deulin, Contes d'un Buveur de Bière, pp. 3-29.]`

The tale is also recounted in the entry for *Gambrinus* (or *Gambrivius*) in W. S. Walsh's *Heroes and heroines of fiction*, 1915, [p117](https://archive.org/details/heroesheroinesof00wals/page/116/mode/2up?q=gambrinus):

> Gambrinus or Gambrinius, the mythical inventor of beer or ale in the folklore of many countries. He is usually spoken of as a king or duke of Flanders and Brabant, flourishing at some uncertain period in the remote past. A tradition favored by mediaeval German historians made him king of the Tuiscones, seventh in descent from Noah, who succeeded his father Marso about 1730 B.C., founded the cities of Cambray and Hamburg (the latter was in effect known to the Romans as Gambrivium) and extended the boundaries of his kingdom from the Rhine to Asia.
>
> Gambrinus is represented as a portly graybeard, rubicund, but dignified, with a crown on his head, ermine on his shoulders, and a foaming tankard in his hands. He is said to have married Isis a curious coincidence, as Isis was the sister of Osiris to whom the Egyptians attributed the invention of beer. In Ireland Gambrivius invents other beverages besides beer. He takes part with other monarchs, his contempo- raries, at mysterious midnight anni- versaries where St. Lawrence weeps tears of fire. So Franconian legend made him assist at a spectral banquet given yearly, May ist, at the Teufels- tisch, by the kings of ancient Franconia.
>
> An apocryphal legend of Gambrinus avowedly invented by Deulin in Contes d'un Buveur de Biere has passed as genuine for instance John Fiske accepts it in Myths and Mythmakers. Here Gambrinus was a poor fiddler who, contemplating suicide, was tempted into making a compact with Satan, thirty years of unlimited prosperity and the forfeit of his soul at the end. From the devil he learned how to make bells and beer and because of these inventions the Holy Roman Emperor created him Duke of Brabant and Count of Flanders. For 30 years Gambrinus sat beneath his own belfry drinking beer with nobles and burghers. Then Satan sent a messenger for him, Jocko, but Jocko, made drunk on beer, was ashamed to return to hell, so Gambrinus lived calmly for a couple of centuries and finally turned into a beer-barrel.
>
> A plausible explanation of the Gambrinus myth resolves the name into a corruption of Jean Primus or John I, Duke of Brabant (1251-1294), who being anxious for popularity had himself received into the guild of brewers at Brussels. His portrait suspended in their guildhaus represented him as clad in all the ducal insignia and holding a foaming tank- ard in his left hand. In course of time this portrait may have been looked upon as the god or inventor of beer and thus given rise to the legend.

~ Gambrinus, King of Beer ~

compiled by Walt Vogdes
 

This article deals with one of the most common decorative motifs to be found on beer steins, that of King Gambrinus, King of Beer. The first part of the article provides a glimpse of some of the history surrounding this character, while the second part tells the story of how Gambrinus and the devil formed a pact which led to the creation of beer.

One of the most commonly found decorations on old beer steins is a stout bearded figure with a crown on his head. Frequently seen astride a barrel of beer, he is also found leading parades or simply raising an over-flowing goblet or stein of beer in a toast to those who enjoy his brew. This is Gambrinus, King of Beer.

While there is evidence that the Mesopotamians enjoyed an early form of beer at least 6,000 years ago, the first use of hops to flavor the brew is sometimes attributed to the Brabant monks of Belgium. George Ehret, a New York City brewer, published the book, Twenty-Five Years of Brewing, which included the following account: "While some attribute the invention of hopped malt-beer to Jan Primus (John I), a scion of the stock of Burgundy princes, who lived about the year 1251, others ascribe it to Jean Sans Peur (1371-1419), otherwise known as Ganbrivius. A corruption of either name may plausibly be shown to have resulted in the present name of the King of Beer, viz., Gambrinus, who we are accustomed to see represented in the habit of a knight of the middle-ages, with the occasional addition of a crown. Popular imagination, it seems, attached such great importance to beer, that in according the honor of its invention, it could not be satisfied with anything less than a king."

The German Beer Brewers Museum in Munich owns a portrait from 1526 of King Gambrinus, and it includes the following verse:

Im Leben ward ich Gambrinus gennant,
König zu Flandern und Brabant,
Ich hab aus Gersten Malz gemacht
Und Bierbrauen zuerst erdacht.
Drum können die Brauer mit Wahrheit sagen,
Daß sie einen König zum Meister haben.

In life I was known as Gambrinus,  
King of Flanders and Brabant,  
From barley I made malt  
And was first at brewing beer.  
Thus the brewers can truthfully say,  
They have a king as master brewer.

When we discover that Jan Primus of Brabant was a noted warrior and local hero with prodigious beer-drinking capacity, we are further encouraged to believe that he is the Gambrinus of popular legend. President of the Brussels Guild of Brewers in the late 13th century, Jan Primus is said to have drunk 72 quarts of beer at one sitting! It's no wonder that he is the hero of brewers everywhere, and that the image of King Gambrinus has been used by countless brewers as a means of "branding" their product.

The legend of Gambrinus

(Thanks go to the web site of Avignon, Provence, France, and to the Gambrinus Pub, for permission to use this edited version of the tale appearing on that site.

This is perhaps the most common portrayal of King Gambrinus, his robe about his shoulders, crown atop his head, stein hoisted in salute, and sitting astride a barrel of his favorite liquid! It is Gambrinus who created beer, and we will tell you how he did that and how he became King. Gambrinus was a poor novice glassmaker from a little town in Flanders, Fresne sur l'Escaut. With his wonderful pink cheeks, his blond hair and blond beard, he was the most beautiful boy in the town (and he had a lot of success with the girls). In his work Gambrinus prepared glass for his master, who had the skill and the exclusive right to blow the glass into different forms. Everything could have been very simple for him, but he fell in love with Flandrine, his master's daughter.

At last, Gambrinus told Flandrine about his feelings. As proud as she was pretty, Flandrine wanted to marry a master like her father, grandfather or even her great-grandfather. But in these times the glassmakers, noble from birth, taught their art only to their sons, so Gambrinus had no hope of becoming a master.

The girl refused Gambrinus so strongly that he decided to leave the glassworks to learn how to play violin and to become a poet. He was so skilled that he quickly became one of the best in the region. Everybody called him in order to liven up weddings, birthdays and other parties.

People from Fresne were amazed at all the things they heard about Gambrinus and they asked him to play for them. When Gambrinus began to play, all the people started to dance and sing. When Gambrinus saw Flandrine enter the room he began to tremble, and he played so badly that the people were annoyed, and they began kicking him and shouting at him.

Gambrinus was arrested and spent one month in jail for disturbing the peace. When he was freed, he decided to kill himself in order to forget Flandrine. He went to the forest, and was preparing to hang himself when the devil appeared. As usual, the devil proposed a deal to Gambrinus: if Gambrinus couldn't earn Flandrine's love, the devil would allow Gambrinus to forget her, in return for possession of his soul for 30 years.

Gambrinus accepted the deal and his love for Flandrine was replaced by a passion for games. He played again and again at every kind of game. He was very skilled and very lucky, whatever game he played. He rapidly became very rich, but he still had longings for Flandrine. He began to think that since he was now rich like a prince, Flandrine might change her mind.

Flandrine's refusal was as clear as the first time - Gambrinus wasn't a noble, he was born as a boy, he will stay a boy for life.

Gambrinus returned to the forest in order to finish what the devil had stopped and he met him for the second time. Gambrinus told the devil him that he wasn't living up to his side of the deal, because he was still in love with Flandrine. Suddenly a field appeared in front of him, long lines of poles were raised and in a while they were covered by green plants, strongly perfumed. "It is hops," said the devil, "and the two houses you see there are a hophouse and a brewery. Come on, I will teach you how to make beer, the Flanders' wine, which will help you forget Flandrine."

Gambrinus learned how to make beer (not without tasting it and finding it delicious). Then he asked how he could take revenge against the people of this town who kicked him, sent him to jail and broke his violin. The devil proposed to him an instrument which nobody could resist and he taught him how to make and play chimes.

Back home, Gambrinus planted the precious seeds given by Beelzebub, and made beer and chimes. One morning he set up tables, chairs, barrels and chimes on the main square of the town and he invited all the people to join him in order to taste his beer. When the townspeople tasted this new drink, sometimes brown or lager, the said "it is bitter", "it is strong", and there were a lot of complaints everywhere. People were laughing and joking about Gambrinus when he started to play chimes, and suddenly all the people started to dance. After an hour they wanted Gambrinus to stop, but instead he played on for hours. At last he stopped, thinking that he had his revenge, and the thirsty revelers began to drink his brew.

They quickly changed their minds, and decided that this beer was the best drink they had ever drunk. His success spread far and wide. Everywhere he planted hops, brewed beer and played chimes. The Flanders King, in order to thank him, offered to make Gambrinus duke, count and lord, but Gambrinus preferred the title of King of Beer, as he was known by the residents of Fresne.

When Flandrine understood that Gambrinus would never come to her again she came to talk to him, but Gambrinus didn't recognize her, and offered her some beer to drink. He had forgotten her.

Gambrinus lived happily with his subjects for 30 years, when the devil came again. But instead of following him, Gambrinus started to play chimes and the devil began to dance. Gambrinus played on and on, and the devil couldn't stop dancing, so that finally the devil begged him to stop and agreed to break the deal.

After that Gambrinus lived happily playing chimes and making beer. When he died, we found at his place a beer barrel, and that is why he doesn't have a tombstone.

Wikipedia _ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambrinus

For his 1868 anthology Contes d'un buveur de bière (English: Tales of a Beer Drinker), French author Charles Deulin wrote a playful short story called "Cambrinus, Roi de la Bière" ("Cambrinus, King of Beer"), in which "Cambrinus" makes a deal with the Devil.[30] Deulin was also a journalist, and drama critic who adapted elements of European folklore into his work.[31][32] The success of "Cambrinus, Roi de la Bière" led to the 1874 publication of Contes du roi Cambrinus ("Tales of King Cambrinus"), a collection of short stories devoted to the character.[31][33]

"Cambrinus, Roi de la Bière"

In this, the seminal Cambrinus short story, Cambrinus is an apprentice glassblower in the Flemish village of Fresnes-sur-Escaut, but he believes that he lacks the skill and upward mobility to succeed in glassblowing. He becomes smitten with the master glassblower's daughter, Flandrine. After she rebuffs him, he apprentices himself instead to a viol master, and learns the instrument. His first public performance goes excellently until he catches sight of Flandrine, and flubs his performance. The crowd turns on him violently, but when the case goes to trial the judge, Jocko, is against Cambrinus. When Cambrinus is released he considers suicide, but Beelzebub intervenes in exchange for the promise of his soul. Beelzebub announces, too, that he has killed the judge.

With diabolical help, Cambrinus wins a fortune in games of skill and chance, becomes an irresistible player of the carillon, and becomes the first mortal to brew beer. Cambrinus' music and beer make him very famous, and eventually the king of the Netherlands heaps titles of nobility on him: Duke of Brabant, Count of Flanders, Lord of Fresnes. But even after founding the town of Cambrai, Cambrinus prefers the villagers' honorary title for him: King of Beer. When Flandrine finally approaches him, he rejects her.

After 30 years, Beelzebub sends Jocko the judge for Cambrinus' soul, but Cambrinus thwarts Jocko by getting him drunk on beer, and thrives for nearly a hundred years more. When Cambrinus finally dies, Beelzebub himself comes for his soul, only to find that Cambrinus' body has become a beer barrel.[34]

*The following tale is not historically accurate. The carillon was invented much later than beer. I havenlt found other folk tales regarding its invention. The story could also include another anachronism, regarding the blowing of glass baubles, which were invented later again, but then the story loses something of its efficiency, and its already not as lean as a it could be, the carillon getting in the way of the beer story.*

Deulin translation - TH  summary:

"Cambrinus, King of Beer", from *Tales of a Beer Drinker*, 1868, Charles Deulin

*I bring you a tale*  
*Of [festive good cheer / sorrow and cheer]*  
*Gather round for my story:*  
*The invention of beer.*

Cambrinus (Gambrinus) was a handsome young assistant to a glassmaker in Flanders, on the French and Belgian border. There were two reasons why Gambrinus would never become a master glassmaker. For one, a Master would only teach their own sons the real secrets of the craft. For two, Gambrinus was a rubbish apprentice. He couldn't even get the furnace to the correct temperature.

Things were complicated by the fact that he was besotted with his master's beautiful daughter, Flandrine. They would have made an attractive couple, but Flandrine expected rather more of a potential husband than a talentless apprentice of dubious parentage and not a penny to his name: he just was not husband material for a respectable master glassmaker's daughter.

Even so, the more she ignored him, the more he fell in love with her. Throughout the cold winter months, the teasing he got from the other apprentices grew unbearable, and the dissatisfaction of the master made him realise that he should seek his fortune elsewhere.

At the end of the year, he left. As he made his way out of town, he chanced upon a violin, the Devil's favourite instrument. Alhough he'd never played a violin before, it seemed that he was a natural, as talented at music as he wasn't at glassmaking. In no time at all, he was playing to audiences and crowds in towns and villages all over Flanders. Throughout the summer, and the Autumn, his reputation grew. Word got back to his hometown, and Cambrinus was invited to play there for the Winter celebrations.

Things started well enough — who could believe that a failed glassmaker's apprentice could become such a good musician in so short a time? — and as he played, the people danced. As he played faster, they danced faster. As they danced faster, he played faster. It was all going so we... until he saw Flandrine...

At which point, he lost it. He lost it completely... This was his chance to impress her with his virtuosity, and he blew it. Flandrine walked out in disgust. Everyone thought he was making fun of them. They booed and jeered and mocked him. It started to get rowdy and the guards were called.

Gambrinus was hauled before the judge and charged with causing a disturbance. The judge was a surly, corrupt old fellow, who sentenced Gambrinus to the pillory and to be thrown into jail for a month.

It was bleak midwinter. He left prison full of shame, with no chance of being able to win the hand of Flandrine. He could see only one way out.

He walked into the forest, the trees still bare of their leaves, and came to a crossroads. There was a large oak tree at one corner. He took a rope from his bag, fashioned a noose, and started to climb the tree. He would end it all. At which point, he noticed a tall man in a long green hunting coat, just standing there, watching.

"Don't mind me" said the man.

Gambrinus felt a little embarrassed.

"Are you, erm, are you waiting for someone?"

"It just so happens that I am, Cambrinus," said the man.  "I am waiting for you."

How did the man knew Gambrinus' name? And:

"What do you mean you're waiting for me?"

"All hanged men make their home in hell, Gambrinus."

Ah... Gambrinus hadn't expected *that* sort of an end.

"And you would be...?"

"Indeed, I am", said the Devil.

"Erm... Err... so, so what if I *don't* hang myself?"

The Devil laughed. "Going by the state of you", he said, hell on earth?" And he laughed again.

Now Gambrinus had heard of poeple doing deals with the devil, so perhaps that was his way out? After all, he'd already lost pretty much everything. And he would still give anything to find favour with Flandrine. Now if he were wealthy...?

"I could certainly help you with that" said the Devil. "How about I give you access to untold wealth for, say, thirty years? And then you give me your soul."

It was a good deal. The deal was done.

When Gambrinus woke up the next day, things seemed different.

He'd never been much good at games before, particularly gamnes that required any level of *skill*. And he'd never been much good at games that required any *luck*. He'd been particularly bad at games that required both skill *and* luck. But now, it seemed, that whatever the game, whatever the challenge, the luck ran his way... and he won. He won A LOT.

Cards, dice, archery competitions, vinkensport, even vinkensport — finch-fighting — which was very popular in Dutch speaking Flanders at the time. Now this was nothing like the good old English sport of cockfighting, either, where specially bred birds with a particularly bad attitude were trained to fight each other to the death, as their owners bet on the outcome. This was far more refined. For in vinkensport, finch fighting, each owner must count how many times in one hour their bird can sing its song, with the score kept on a blackboard.

And Gambrinus' bird sang its refrains, not just with perfect repetition, but far faster than any other bird had ever done before, or even been spoken of doing. But more than that, Gambrinus' bird gave a perfect performance of over 900 times in one hour (950, at least). And so even at vinkensport, Gambirnus would always take first prize, as well as the winnings from a hefty side bet he'd always manage to place too.

Anyway, Gambrinus won competitions with his finch for miles aroud, and with all the other games of skill and chance, he was soon very wealthy indeed.

When he returned home, he could afford to be seen in all the best places around town. In all the places that Flandrine might be seen. One day he saw her. He was still handsome, although his stare had something of a manic look about it as his eyes darted around the room, looking for any opportunity to try out his luck. But when he saw Flandrine, he was all focus.

"You seem to have done well for yourself" said Flandrine, but when she found out he had come by his wealth from "GAMBLING??? You think I would marry a GAMBLER?", he was left, once again, chastised. And embarrassed.

"What use is money" he said to himself, "if it can't buy me love?" And he set off trudging back towards the crossroads. He opened his bag, and took out the rope, still fashioned into a noose. He was just looking up at the branch on the old oak tree when he heard a familiar voice behind him: "Back again? The gambling doesn't suit you?"

Gambrinus turned round to see the Devil standing there, with the judge in tow. He had sold his soul to the Devil several years before, and today was his pay day.

"I hear that people drink to forget..." said the Devil, "and we did say you could have thirty years..."

So Gambrinus put the rope back in his sack— perhaps he wasn't quite ready for hell just yet — and set off walking back into towm...

He stopped at the first ale house he came to; now, at that time, ale was made from barley, water and yeast, and flavoured with herbs. But rather than making him forget, it made Gambrinus even more depressed. "What do I have to do to make her love me? I love her so much...." And he cried into his pint.

He moved onto red wine, but that just made him seethe with resentment and jealousy over the other good for nothing men who made eyes at her, and whom she looked back at, with favour.

The whisky, the brandy, the gin: they just made his head spin. And as the world spun round, all he could see was dozens and dozens of dancing Flandrines, spinning around as she danced with other suitors.

He walked back to the crossroads.

Eventually, he managed to get the rope out of his bag.

Eventually, he managed to get half way up to the first branch before falling back again, landing on top of the man in the green coat.

"Maybe we're going about this the wrong way?", said the devil, picking himself up from the floor and brushing himself down. "Come with me. I've been working on a new idea...".

After a short walk, they came out of the wood into a wide open field, lined with rows and rows of poles and wires and fragrant plants growing up them: hops. "I think this, perhaps, will cure you of your love sickness..."

With *hops* added to the barley as well as the yeast, and the water, you can make a new sort of drink... *beer*. The ambrosia of men, if not of the gods.

"Just crush the barley", said the Devil, "brew it in vats, and *then* mix in the hops... and they will give it a flavour like nothing you've ever tasted before. It will age and mature in the barrel. You can make it blonde or brown. And it will make you happy. And sociable. And Flandrine, well, who needs Flandrine if you can can be in the company of beer, and the company of other beer drinkers?! Here, try some..."

And he did.

Gambrinus took a hearty swig and... his first taste. And *bleurghhh*... That's horrible...

The Devil gestured that he should try another taste.

It didn't taste quite so bad this time...

Rather than sipping it, he tried quaffing it...
And, actually, it wasn't that bad. It wasn't that bad at all. And he started to relax. And to start thinking. And to smile to himself.

"This - beer, do you say? — once you get a taste for it, it tastes pretty good. But I also have a taste for something else: for *revenge*. The people in my home town mocked me. And now I want to mock them back, I want revenge..."

The Devil smiled: he liked this sort of thinking, and so together, they both came up with a plan...

It was a Sunday, and all around them was the sound of Church bells, calling people to prayer...

"What is it about the sound of bells," said the Devil, "that makes people feel compelled to go to Church?"

Gambrinus shrugged.

Now the devil is nothing if not resourceful: he's always looking for an angle, he's always looking for a way in... And the Devil also has a sense of humour - Gambrinus had had his chance with the devil's own favourite instrument once before, with the violin. But what if he could use God's bells to cause mischief?

"I have it! Gather some bells, some tubular bells, some chimes. Two dozen or more, all properly tuned; then hook up two keyboards: one for keys, one for pedals. The sound will be like nothing anyone has heard before; it will drive them crazy..."

So Gambrinus set to work. With some of his gambling money, he managed to the instrument the devil had come up with - a *carillon*, they're called. With rather more of it, he built a brewery. And with the last of the money, he made a belfry for the brewery, and set the carillon in it.

For the opening day, he had made two brews: a blond beer, and a brown one. *Everyone* was invited to the first tasting...

And everyone hated it... "Erghh... that's so bitter..."

But then Gambrinus started to play the chimes. And with some semblance of his previous musical talent, he got the chimes to play sounds and tunes the likes of which the people had never heard before. And if they had danced before, back when he had been able to play the violin, they danced now with the passion of whirling dervishes. And Gambrinus played on...

"Stop...", they pleaded, "we need to rest", but he played on some more...

"Stop" they pleaded, "we need a drink"...

And Gambrinus smiled.

And as everyone tried the beer *this* time, they found it to be refreshing. It was good... it was really good... Cheers!

After a pint or two each, and maybe one or two more for the heavier drinkers amongst them, they were ready to dance again...

Over the following days, the news began to spread. People came from miles around to try the beer and to dance to the carillon.

So taken was the King of the Netherlands by the newly invented beer that he made Gambrinus a Duke; but the title Gambrinus preferred to all others was the title that the people had given to him: the "king of beer".

Every day, Gambrinus would drink, along with his patrons. His nose turned red and his face filled out; to say he became portly would be too generous. But he was a sociable host, and would chat to friends old and new, from dawn to dusk, and always with a pint in his hand.

One day, Flandrine came to visit. Now that he was a Duke, well, he had come up in the world, hadn't he? But he didn't even recognize her, simply offered her a pint, as he would offer anyone a pint. He had completely forgotten about her. And this time, it was she who went away dejected.

Eventually, the thirty years from his bargain with the Devil were up. Midwinter. It is said that the Devil sent the corrupt old judge to collect Gambrinus' soul, and that Gambrinus had seen him coming. He'd offered him a drink, the drink had had a drink, and before too long, the drink had had the judge. Gambrinus had wandered over to the bell tower, and started to play the carillon, and before the judge knew what was happening, he was caught up in a whirl of dancers. He'd never been the life and soul of a party before, but he found it was fun. And the Dad dancing started in earnest. Eventually, he collapsed on the floor, in a dazed and happy stupor, for three days and three nights.

When he came too, he was too embarrassed to go back to collect Gambrinus' soul, or even to return to face the wrath of the devil. He's still wandering now, from bar to bar. I'm pretty sure I met him here once, in this very place, and it was he who me this tale.

And so it was that the Devil would have to wait until Gambrinus' life met its natural end, at the ripe old age of a hundred. By that time, he had become something of a fixture at the end of the bar; he still drank every day, his shape had became ever more rotund, and his conversation ever more wooden. So much so, in fact, that when the Devil himself came to collect Gambrinus' soul, he found that that Gambrinus had turned into a beer barrel.

And that is the end of the story. Except to say that the Devil had the last laugh, as he so often does. Because Gambrinus is as much a nobody today, as he was at the start of the story. Nobody remembers him as the original King of Beer. Ot at least, perhaps not until now.

Gambrinus - v short https://www.germansteins.com/gambrinus-the-beer-king/ Longer alternative (feat. the Devil) https://lordsofthedrinks.org/2015/08/13/the-legend-of-gambrinus-the-king-of-beer/

In the most popular folk tale about the King of Beer, Gambrinus is a good-looking but poor young man, who works as a glassblower’s apprentice. He falls in love with the daughter of his boss, Flandrine, but she wants nothing with him. "Not before you become a man with status."

The heartbroken Gambrinus leaves his town in an attempt to forget Flandrine. While traveling with his violin, it turns out that he has a real talent for music. Soon enough he is well-known all over Belgium and Holland. When the people of his town hear about this famous musician from their town they are very proud of him and beg him to come back. So Gambrinus returns and gives his first concert in his hometown. He is amazing, until he spots Flandrine in the crowd and chokes. His music becomes awful and the crowd goes mad and riots. As Gambrinus is held responsible for these riots, he is thrown in jail. There he draws the conclusion that his life is worthless and it’s best to hang himself.

As he is about to commit suicide, the Devil, dressed as a hunter, visits Gambrinus in his jail cell and asks him why he is so unhappy and if he can change that in exchange for his soul in 30 years. Gambrinus says he would give everything up if Flandrine would fall in love with him. The Devil says that love is the one thing that is beyond his control but he can basically do anything else. “Well, then give me something to take my mind of her”, says Gambrinus. The Devil says he has such a thing and they sign a contract for his soul.

The next day when he gets out of jail, the young lad feels a strong urge for betting. This new passion, with the help of the devil, makes him very rich, but he still hasn’t lost his passion for Flandrine. He looks her up and says he is very rich now, but still she refuses him. “I don’t care if you have money or not. You’re still a nobody. Come back when you are a king or a duke.”

As Gambrinus leaves town depressed, he meets with the ‘hunter’ a second time. He explains how gambling could not erase his love for Flandrine and if the Devil can do anything else for him. “Sure, you see those plants over there? I will show you how to use them in a drink called beer.” The Devil shows Gambrinus how to build a brewery, how to brew beer and gives him seeds to grow hops. Not without a little tasting of course and after a few cups the sad man actually does feel a lot better. The Devil also gives him a chime that plays such wonderful music, that everyone that hears its music simply must dance to it.

Gambrinus goes back to his hometown and grows his hops, builds his brewery and practices on his chime. And when his first brew is ready he calls on all the people from his town, who humiliated him at his last concert, to the market square for a taste. At first none of them likes this bitter drink and they mock Gambrinus and his stupid beer. But then he starts to play his chime and of course everyone starts to dance. He lets them suffer for several hours, till everyone is really thirsty. When the music finally stops they turn to the beer and love it more with every sip they take. Gambrinus and his brewery are a hit and this news travels fast.

Gambrinus spreads his new drink all over the country and the King of the Netherlands even rewards him with a title: Duke of Brabant. Allthough Gambrinus himself prefers the unofficial title King of Beer better. He spends his days mostly drinking and partying. Finally he is not only rich, but also a man who moves around in the highest circles of society.

Flandrine, who secretly liked him too all this time but was too proud to admit it, waits for the duke to come back and ask her hand a third time. But when he doesn’t she decides to pay him a visit. As she puts out her hand, Gambrinus doesn’t recognize her and thinks it’s just another person that wants to try his beer. So he gives her a glass and turns away. The beer finally got him to forget Flandrine, as he wished for.

The times pass and for 30 years Gambrinus lives the good life. But then the Devil comes back to collect his soul. When he spots him the tipsy duke decides to welcome him with music from his chime. As it turns out even the Devil can’t resist these tones and he starts dancing. After a few hours every bone in his body starts to hurt and he begs Gambrinus to stop. He will even tear up the contract for his soul, if the King of Beer doesn’t play one more note. So it happens. The happy Gambrinus gives the devil a barrel of his own brew, that he finishes in one angry sip before returning to hell, claiming he’ll be back for this soul after Gambrinus’ natural life.

The King of Beer lives almost 100 years in drunkenness until finally word reaches hell that he died. The Devil is eager to collect his soul but when he gets to the place where Gambrinus has died, instead of a body he finds a beer barrel. The Devil then accepts that the soul of the King of Beer will never be his.

Gambrinus and the huge barrel

And there’s a second famous tale about how Gambrinus gained his title King of Beer. A group of brewers came together to choose their new leader. They agreed that it had to be someone who was strong and courageous and they came up with a contest; whoever could carry a huge beer barrel the fastest over a distance of ‘two stone throws’, would be their new first man.

One after another tried to move this enormous barrel full of beer. Some of the contestants managed to move it a few meters but nobody came even close to the finish line. Last of all it was Gambrinus’ turn. Instead of using brutal force, he had a servant install a little tap in the barrel. He then went to lay under it and drank beer till the barrel was empty. After this cunning trick it was a piece of cake to move the barrel.

Impressed by his shrewdness, as well as his drinking skills, the other brewers immediately named Gambrinus their leader and gave him the title King of Beer.

The [German Steins](https://www.germansteins.com/gambrinus-the-beer-king/) website hints at a legend I haven't yet found mention of elsewhere:

> Around the year 1100, the brewers of Brussels deliberated which strong and courageous man should be their leader. They organized a contest, at which a large beer barrel was placed on the ground. The one who could carry it to a spot two stone's throws away would become their head brewer.
>
> Among many who registered for the contest was a Duke from Brabent, whose name was Jan Primus, a man of great strength and considerable intellect.  With obvious joy, he followed the futile efforts of the numerous competitors to move the beer barrel.  When his turn came, he ordered the servant to beat a spigot into the bunghole.  He then lied down under the barrel, opened the tap and drank until the barrel was empty.  Having done this, he carried the barrel effortlessly to the winning post.
>
> On the strength of this clever idea, the brewers of Brussels appointed him as their honorary leader.  From then on he was the patron of brewers and innkeepers and Jan Primus became Gambrinus, the King of Beer.

Another tale tells of....? battle, climbs on beer barrels and drinks? ??heavy drinker?

Legend - hops??

[ale - traditionally made without hops; flavouring add bitterness started to be added to beer made in Belgium, Holland and wesern Germany using gruit, a herbal mixture. Things like heather, and ivy, and mugwort; and the gruit mixture was taxed.] Hops also had a stabilising, anti=bactierial effect, a natural preservative, as well as adding the bitterness.
