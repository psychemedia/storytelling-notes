# Gambrinus, King of Beer

*As befits a bar, a tale about the invention of beer...*

If there's any particular kind of place in which you're likely hear people talking about "the King of Beer", it's probably in a bar. And if it's the beer speaking, it's no wonder that any tales told get misheard, mis-told, and misremembered, if not forgotten altogether by the morning after...

And so it is with tales of Gambrinus, the King of Beer. Here's one particular story that I heard tell of...




A summary is provided in John Fiske's *Myths And Mythmakers: Old Tales And Superstitions Interpreted By Comparative Mythology*, 1872, [p173-5](https://archive.org/details/mythsandmythmake003324mbp/page/n187/mode/2up)

> In the legend of Gambrinus, the fiend is still more ingloriously defeated. Gambrinus was a fiddler, who, being jilted by his sweetheart, went out into the woods to hang himself. As he was sitting on the bough, with the cord about his neck, preparatory to taking the fatal plunge, suddenly a tall man in a green coat appeared before him, and offered his services. He might become as wealthy as he liked, and make his sweetheart burst with vexation at her own folly, but in thirty years he must give up his soul to Beelzebub. The bargain was struck, for Gambrinus thought thirty years a long time to enjoy one's self in, and perhaps the Devil might get him in any event ; as well be hung for a sheep as for a lamb. Aided by Satan, he invented chiming bells and lager beer, for both of which achievements his name is held in grateful remembrance by the Teuton. No sooner had the Holy Roman Emperor quaffed a gallon or two of the new beverage than he made Gambrinus Duke of Brabant and Count of Flanders, and then it was the fiddler's turn to laugh at the discomfiture of his old sweetheart. Gambrinus kept clear of women, says the legend, and so lived in peace. For thirty years he sat beneath his belfry with the chimes, meditatively drinking beer with his nobles and burghers around him. Then Beelzebub sent Jocko, one of his imps, with orders to bring back Gambrinus before midnight. But Jocko was, like Swiveller's Marchioness, ignorant of the taste of beer, never having drunk of it even in a sip, and the Flemish *schoppen* were too much for him. He fell into a drunken sleep, and did not wake up until noon next day, at which he was so mortified that he had not the face to go back to hell at all. So Gambrinus lived on tranquilly for a century or two, and drank so much beer that he turned into a beer-barrel. `[See Deulin, Contes d'un Buveur de Bière, pp. 3-29.]`

The tale is also recounted in the entry for *Gambrinus* (or *Gambrivius*) in W. S. Walsh's *Heroes and heroines of fiction*, 1915, [p117](https://archive.org/details/heroesheroinesof00wals/page/116/mode/2up?q=gambrinus):

> Gambrinus or Gambrinius, the mythical inventor of beer or ale in the folklore of many countries. He is usually spoken of as a king or duke of Flanders and Brabant, flourishing at some uncertain period in the remote past. A tradition favored by mediaeval German historians made him king of the Tuiscones, seventh in descent from Noah, who succeeded his father Marso about 1730 B.C., founded the cities of Cambray and Hamburg (the latter was in effect known to the Romans as Gambrivium) and extended the boundaries of his kingdom from the Rhine to Asia.
>
> Gambrinus is represented as a portly graybeard, rubicund, but dignified, with a crown on his head, ermine on his shoulders, and a foaming tankard in his hands. He is said to have married Isis a curious coincidence, as Isis was the sister of Osiris to whom the Egyptians attributed the invention of beer. In Ireland Gambrivius invents other beverages besides beer. He takes part with other monarchs, his contempo- raries, at mysterious midnight anni- versaries where St. Lawrence weeps tears of fire. So Franconian legend made him assist at a spectral banquet given yearly, May ist, at the Teufels- tisch, by the kings of ancient Franconia.
>
> An apocryphal legend of Gambrinus avowedly invented by Deulin in Contes d'un Buveur de Biere has passed as genuine for instance John Fiske accepts it in Myths and Mythmakers. Here Gambrinus was a poor fiddler who, contemplating suicide, was tempted into making a compact with Satan, thirty years of unlimited prosperity and the forfeit of his soul at the end. From the devil he learned how to make bells and beer and because of these inventions the Holy Roman Emperor created him Duke of Brabant and Count of Flanders. For 30 years Gambrinus sat beneath his own belfry drinking beer with nobles and burghers. Then Satan sent a messenger for him, Jocko, but Jocko, made drunk on beer, was ashamed to return to hell, so Gambrinus lived calmly for a couple of centuries and finally turned into a beer-barrel.
>
> A plausible explanation of the Gambrinus myth resolves the name into a corruption of Jean Primus or John I, Duke of Brabant (1251-1294), who being anxious for popularity had himself received into the guild of brewers at Brussels. His portrait suspended in their guildhaus represented him as clad in all the ducal insignia and holding a foaming tank- ard in his left hand. In course of time this portrait may have been looked upon as the god or inventor of beer and thus given rise to the legend.

~ Gambrinus, King of Beer ~

compiled by Walt Vogdes
 

This article deals with one of the most common decorative motifs to be found on beer steins, that of King Gambrinus, King of Beer. The first part of the article provides a glimpse of some of the history surrounding this character, while the second part tells the story of how Gambrinus and the devil formed a pact which led to the creation of beer.

One of the most commonly found decorations on old beer steins is a stout bearded figure with a crown on his head. Frequently seen astride a barrel of beer, he is also found leading parades or simply raising an over-flowing goblet or stein of beer in a toast to those who enjoy his brew. This is Gambrinus, King of Beer.

While there is evidence that the Mesopotamians enjoyed an early form of beer at least 6,000 years ago, the first use of hops to flavor the brew is sometimes attributed to the Brabant monks of Belgium. George Ehret, a New York City brewer, published the book, Twenty-Five Years of Brewing, which included the following account: "While some attribute the invention of hopped malt-beer to Jan Primus (John I), a scion of the stock of Burgundy princes, who lived about the year 1251, others ascribe it to Jean Sans Peur (1371-1419), otherwise known as Ganbrivius. A corruption of either name may plausibly be shown to have resulted in the present name of the King of Beer, viz., Gambrinus, who we are accustomed to see represented in the habit of a knight of the middle-ages, with the occasional addition of a crown. Popular imagination, it seems, attached such great importance to beer, that in according the honor of its invention, it could not be satisfied with anything less than a king."

The German Beer Brewers Museum in Munich owns a portrait from 1526 of King Gambrinus, and it includes the following verse:

Im Leben ward ich Gambrinus gennant,
König zu Flandern und Brabant,
Ich hab aus Gersten Malz gemacht
Und Bierbrauen zuerst erdacht.
Drum können die Brauer mit Wahrheit sagen,
Daß sie einen König zum Meister haben.

In life I was known as Gambrinus,  
King of Flanders and Brabant,  
From barley I made malt  
And was first at brewing beer.  
Thus the brewers can truthfully say,  
They have a king as master brewer.

When we discover that Jan Primus of Brabant was a noted warrior and local hero with prodigious beer-drinking capacity, we are further encouraged to believe that he is the Gambrinus of popular legend. President of the Brussels Guild of Brewers in the late 13th century, Jan Primus is said to have drunk 72 quarts of beer at one sitting! It's no wonder that he is the hero of brewers everywhere, and that the image of King Gambrinus has been used by countless brewers as a means of "branding" their product.

The legend of Gambrinus

(Thanks go to the web site of Avignon, Provence, France, and to the Gambrinus Pub, for permission to use this edited version of the tale appearing on that site.

This is perhaps the most common portrayal of King Gambrinus, his robe about his shoulders, crown atop his head, stein hoisted in salute, and sitting astride a barrel of his favorite liquid! It is Gambrinus who created beer, and we will tell you how he did that and how he became King. Gambrinus was a poor novice glassmaker from a little town in Flanders, Fresne sur l'Escaut. With his wonderful pink cheeks, his blond hair and blond beard, he was the most beautiful boy in the town (and he had a lot of success with the girls). In his work Gambrinus prepared glass for his master, who had the skill and the exclusive right to blow the glass into different forms. Everything could have been very simple for him, but he fell in love with Flandrine, his master's daughter.

At last, Gambrinus told Flandrine about his feelings. As proud as she was pretty, Flandrine wanted to marry a master like her father, grandfather or even her great-grandfather. But in these times the glassmakers, noble from birth, taught their art only to their sons, so Gambrinus had no hope of becoming a master.

The girl refused Gambrinus so strongly that he decided to leave the glassworks to learn how to play violin and to become a poet. He was so skilled that he quickly became one of the best in the region. Everybody called him in order to liven up weddings, birthdays and other parties.

People from Fresne were amazed at all the things they heard about Gambrinus and they asked him to play for them. When Gambrinus began to play, all the people started to dance and sing. When Gambrinus saw Flandrine enter the room he began to tremble, and he played so badly that the people were annoyed, and they began kicking him and shouting at him.

Gambrinus was arrested and spent one month in jail for disturbing the peace. When he was freed, he decided to kill himself in order to forget Flandrine. He went to the forest, and was preparing to hang himself when the devil appeared. As usual, the devil proposed a deal to Gambrinus: if Gambrinus couldn't earn Flandrine's love, the devil would allow Gambrinus to forget her, in return for possession of his soul for 30 years.

Gambrinus accepted the deal and his love for Flandrine was replaced by a passion for games. He played again and again at every kind of game. He was very skilled and very lucky, whatever game he played. He rapidly became very rich, but he still had longings for Flandrine. He began to think that since he was now rich like a prince, Flandrine might change her mind.

Flandrine's refusal was as clear as the first time - Gambrinus wasn't a noble, he was born as a boy, he will stay a boy for life.

Gambrinus returned to the forest in order to finish what the devil had stopped and he met him for the second time. Gambrinus told the devil him that he wasn't living up to his side of the deal, because he was still in love with Flandrine. Suddenly a field appeared in front of him, long lines of poles were raised and in a while they were covered by green plants, strongly perfumed. "It is hops," said the devil, "and the two houses you see there are a hophouse and a brewery. Come on, I will teach you how to make beer, the Flanders' wine, which will help you forget Flandrine."

Gambrinus learned how to make beer (not without tasting it and finding it delicious). Then he asked how he could take revenge against the people of this town who kicked him, sent him to jail and broke his violin. The devil proposed to him an instrument which nobody could resist and he taught him how to make and play chimes.

Back home, Gambrinus planted the precious seeds given by Beelzebub, and made beer and chimes. One morning he set up tables, chairs, barrels and chimes on the main square of the town and he invited all the people to join him in order to taste his beer. When the townspeople tasted this new drink, sometimes brown or lager, the said "it is bitter", "it is strong", and there were a lot of complaints everywhere. People were laughing and joking about Gambrinus when he started to play chimes, and suddenly all the people started to dance. After an hour they wanted Gambrinus to stop, but instead he played on for hours. At last he stopped, thinking that he had his revenge, and the thirsty revelers began to drink his brew.

They quickly changed their minds, and decided that this beer was the best drink they had ever drunk. His success spread far and wide. Everywhere he planted hops, brewed beer and played chimes. The Flanders King, in order to thank him, offered to make Gambrinus duke, count and lord, but Gambrinus preferred the title of King of Beer, as he was known by the residents of Fresne.

When Flandrine understood that Gambrinus would never come to her again she came to talk to him, but Gambrinus didn't recognize her, and offered her some beer to drink. He had forgotten her.

Gambrinus lived happily with his subjects for 30 years, when the devil came again. But instead of following him, Gambrinus started to play chimes and the devil began to dance. Gambrinus played on and on, and the devil couldn't stop dancing, so that finally the devil begged him to stop and agreed to break the deal.

After that Gambrinus lived happily playing chimes and making beer. When he died, we found at his place a beer barrel, and that is why he doesn't have a tombstone.

Wikipedia _ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambrinus

For his 1868 anthology Contes d'un buveur de bière (English: Tales of a Beer Drinker), French author Charles Deulin wrote a playful short story called "Cambrinus, Roi de la Bière" ("Cambrinus, King of Beer"), in which "Cambrinus" makes a deal with the Devil.[30] Deulin was also a journalist, and drama critic who adapted elements of European folklore into his work.[31][32] The success of "Cambrinus, Roi de la Bière" led to the 1874 publication of Contes du roi Cambrinus ("Tales of King Cambrinus"), a collection of short stories devoted to the character.[31][33]

"Cambrinus, Roi de la Bière"

In this, the seminal Cambrinus short story, Cambrinus is an apprentice glassblower in the Flemish village of Fresnes-sur-Escaut, but he believes that he lacks the skill and upward mobility to succeed in glassblowing. He becomes smitten with the master glassblower's daughter, Flandrine. After she rebuffs him, he apprentices himself instead to a viol master, and learns the instrument. His first public performance goes excellently until he catches sight of Flandrine, and flubs his performance. The crowd turns on him violently, but when the case goes to trial the judge, Jocko, is against Cambrinus. When Cambrinus is released he considers suicide, but Beelzebub intervenes in exchange for the promise of his soul. Beelzebub announces, too, that he has killed the judge.

With diabolical help, Cambrinus wins a fortune in games of skill and chance, becomes an irresistible player of the carillon, and becomes the first mortal to brew beer. Cambrinus' music and beer make him very famous, and eventually the king of the Netherlands heaps titles of nobility on him: Duke of Brabant, Count of Flanders, Lord of Fresnes. But even after founding the town of Cambrai, Cambrinus prefers the villagers' honorary title for him: King of Beer. When Flandrine finally approaches him, he rejects her.

After 30 years, Beelzebub sends Jocko the judge for Cambrinus' soul, but Cambrinus thwarts Jocko by getting him drunk on beer, and thrives for nearly a hundred years more. When Cambrinus finally dies, Beelzebub himself comes for his soul, only to find that Cambrinus' body has become a beer barrel.[34]

*The following tale is not historically accurate. The carillon was invented much later than beer. I havenlt found other folk tales regarding its invention. The story could also include another anachronism, regarding the blowing of glass baubles, which were invented later again, but then the story loses something of its efficiency, and its already not as lean as a it could be, the carillon getting in the way of the beer story.*

Gambrinus - v short https://www.germansteins.com/gambrinus-the-beer-king/ Longer alternative (feat. the Devil) https://lordsofthedrinks.org/2015/08/13/the-legend-of-gambrinus-the-king-of-beer/

In the most popular folk tale about the King of Beer, Gambrinus is a good-looking but poor young man, who works as a glassblower’s apprentice. He falls in love with the daughter of his boss, Flandrine, but she wants nothing with him. "Not before you become a man with status."

The heartbroken Gambrinus leaves his town in an attempt to forget Flandrine. While traveling with his violin, it turns out that he has a real talent for music. Soon enough he is well-known all over Belgium and Holland. When the people of his town hear about this famous musician from their town they are very proud of him and beg him to come back. So Gambrinus returns and gives his first concert in his hometown. He is amazing, until he spots Flandrine in the crowd and chokes. His music becomes awful and the crowd goes mad and riots. As Gambrinus is held responsible for these riots, he is thrown in jail. There he draws the conclusion that his life is worthless and it’s best to hang himself.

As he is about to commit suicide, the Devil, dressed as a hunter, visits Gambrinus in his jail cell and asks him why he is so unhappy and if he can change that in exchange for his soul in 30 years. Gambrinus says he would give everything up if Flandrine would fall in love with him. The Devil says that love is the one thing that is beyond his control but he can basically do anything else. “Well, then give me something to take my mind of her”, says Gambrinus. The Devil says he has such a thing and they sign a contract for his soul.

The next day when he gets out of jail, the young lad feels a strong urge for betting. This new passion, with the help of the devil, makes him very rich, but he still hasn’t lost his passion for Flandrine. He looks her up and says he is very rich now, but still she refuses him. “I don’t care if you have money or not. You’re still a nobody. Come back when you are a king or a duke.”

The devil dressed up in a hunter uniform with feathered hat. —— image

As Gambrinus leaves town depressed, he meets with the ‘hunter’ a second time. He explains how gambling could not erase his love for Flandrine and if the Devil can do anything else for him. “Sure, you see those plants over there? I will show you how to use them in a drink called beer.” The Devil shows Gambrinus how to build a brewery, how to brew beer and gives him seeds to grow hops. Not without a little tasting of course and after a few cups the sad man actually does feel a lot better. The Devil also gives him a chime that plays such wonderful music, that everyone that hears its music simply must dance to it.

Gambrinus goes back to his hometown and grows his hops, builds his brewery and practices on his chime. And when his first brew is ready he calls on all the people from his town, who humiliated him at his last concert, to the market square for a taste. At first none of them likes this bitter drink and they mock Gambrinus and his stupid beer. But then he starts to play his chime and of course everyone starts to dance. He lets them suffer for several hours, till everyone is really thirsty. When the music finally stops they turn to the beer and love it more with every sip they take. Gambrinus and his brewery are a hit and this news travels fast.

Gambrinus spreads his new drink all over the country and the King of the Netherlands even rewards him with a title: Duke of Brabant. Allthough Gambrinus himself prefers the unofficial title King of Beer better. He spends his days mostly drinking and partying. Finally he is not only rich, but also a man who moves around in the highest circles of society.

Flandrine, who secretly liked him too all this time but was too proud to admit it, waits for the duke to come back and ask her hand a third time. But when he doesn’t she decides to pay him a visit. As she puts out her hand, Gambrinus doesn’t recognize her and thinks it’s just another person that wants to try his beer. So he gives her a glass and turns away. The beer finally got him to forget Flandrine, as he wished for.

The times pass and for 30 years Gambrinus lives the good life. But then the Devil comes back to collect his soul. When he spots him the tipsy duke decides to welcome him with music from his chime. As it turns out even the Devil can’t resist these tones and he starts dancing. After a few hours every bone in his body starts to hurt and he begs Gambrinus to stop. He will even tear up the contract for his soul, if the King of Beer doesn’t play one more note. So it happens. The happy Gambrinus gives the devil a barrel of his own brew, that he finishes in one angry sip before returning to hell, claiming he’ll be back for this soul after Gambrinus’ natural life.

The King of Beer lives almost 100 years in drunkenness until finally word reaches hell that he died. The Devil is eager to collect his soul but when he gets to the place where Gambrinus has died, instead of a body he finds a beer barrel. The Devil then accepts that the soul of the King of Beer will never be his.

Gambrinus and the huge barrel

And there’s a second famous tale about how Gambrinus gained his title King of Beer. A group of brewers came together to choose their new leader. They agreed that it had to be someone who was strong and courageous and they came up with a contest; whoever could carry a huge beer barrel the fastest over a distance of ‘two stone throws’, would be their new first man.

One after another tried to move this enormous barrel full of beer. Some of the contestants managed to move it a few meters but nobody came even close to the finish line. Last of all it was Gambrinus’ turn. Instead of using brutal force, he had a servant install a little tap in the barrel. He then went to lay under it and drank beer till the barrel was empty. After this cunning trick it was a piece of cake to move the barrel.

Impressed by his shrewdness, as well as his drinking skills, the other brewers immediately named Gambrinus their leader and gave him the title King of Beer.

----

The [German Steins](https://www.germansteins.com/gambrinus-the-beer-king/) website hints at a legend I haven't yet found mention of elsewhere:

> Around the year 1100, the brewers of Brussels deliberated which strong and courageous man should be their leader. They organized a contest, at which a large beer barrel was placed on the ground. The one who could carry it to a spot two stone's throws away would become their head brewer.
>
> Among many who registered for the contest was a Duke from Brabent, whose name was Jan Primus, a man of great strength and considerable intellect.  With obvious joy, he followed the futile efforts of the numerous competitors to move the beer barrel.  When his turn came, he ordered the servant to beat a spigot into the bunghole.  He then lied down under the barrel, opened the tap and drank until the barrel was empty.  Having done this, he carried the barrel effortlessly to the winning post.
>
> On the strength of this clever idea, the brewers of Brussels appointed him as their honorary leader.  From then on he was the patron of brewers and innkeepers and Jan Primus became Gambrinus, the King of Beer.

Another tale tells of....? battle, climbs on beer barrels and drinks? ??heavy drinker?

Legend - hops??

[ale - traditionally made without hops; flavouring add bitterness started to be added to beer made in Belgium, Holland and wesern Germany using gruit, a herbal mixture. Things like heather, and ivy, and mugwort; and the gruit mixture was taxed.] Hops also had a stabilising, anti=bactierial effect, a natural preservative, as well as adding the bitterness.
