# Ace of Spades

The Ace of Spades. If you're a fan of the new wave of British heavy metal bands in the mid-70s and early eighties — I'm talking, decades, here, not averages of the band memebers, though probably that too, actually, at least for the ones who aren't dead yet — that can only mean one thing: Lemmy, Motorhead, heavy metal umlauts, and one of the greatest songs by one of the greatest rock bands, ever.

But it's also known as the Death card.

And not just because that card is, arguably, one of the black aces in the dead man's hand of aces and eights that wild-west folk hero and gun-slinger, Wild Bill Hickok, was holding when he was shot in the back of the head in a saloon bar in 1876.

## A Tragic Affair in Southsea

Take, for example, this tragic report from Southsea, in December, 1806:

Hampshire Chronicle - Monday 22 December 1806

On Wednesday last a most melancholy circumstance occurred on Southsea Common. Mr. W. A. Limerick, in company with Mr. J. Hyde, Mr. W. Hamilton, and Mr. W. Wilkinson, having agreed to shoot at a mark for a wager, assembled near the bathing machines for the purpose of deciding the bet; when, having fixed the ace of spades to a post, they withdrew to a distance of twelve yards. Limerick, by the consent of the party, was to have the first fire; he accordingly pulled the trigger of his pistol, which hung fire, when he removed, and another of the party came up to fire. Limerick had moved but a very short distance, when he received a ball in his right side, which passed through his body, grasing both his arms. The ball came from the pistol of Mr. Hamilton, which accidentally went off as he was about to fire at the card.— Mr. Limerick immediately dropped his pistol, and, after running about 50 yards, fell down. He was taken to the bathing-house, and from thence to the Crown Inn, where he expired early the next morning. The most perfect friendship existed amongst them; and the unfortunate deceased made oath before his death that it was accidental. A coroner's inquest was held on the body, and a verdict of *accidental death* returned. Mr. Limerick had recently got his appointment as a writer in the East India Company's service, and was waiting to take his passage in the General Stuart East Indiaman, to India, where his father is, and from whom he has been absent years. He was buried on Saturday morning in the Garrison Chapel. The other gentlemen belonged to the General Stuart.

A tragedy, for sure. But the Ace of Spades association with death goes back further still, to a time when the penalty for evading the payment of Duty on playing cards was a capital one.

## A History of Stamp Duty on Playing Cards

Let us set the scene with a historical review of how duty came to be levied on playing cards:

DUTIES ON PLAYING-CARDS.

" It is quite right that there should be a heavy duty on Cards." — SOUTHEY.

That Playing-Cards, being articles of luxury, are fit objects for the imposition of a duty, is a proposition which can hardly be denied. But what the amount of the duty should be is by no means clear. A high duty checks production, diminishes consumption, and leads to evasion. Experience renders it probable that the present duty of 3d. a pack is about as high a one as can be borne, without defeating its own object, as will appear from the following historical sketch.

A tax was first levied on playing-cards in the reign of James I. (1615). In the "Calendar of State Papers," Domestic Series, A.D. 1611-1618, is the following minute: — "1615, July 20, Westminster. — (19). Letters Patent granting to Sir Richard Coningsby, for a rent of £200 per annum, the imposition of 5s. per gross on playing-cards, and the office of Inspector of all playing-cards imported in recompense of £1,800 due to him by the King, and of his patent for the sole export of Tin, granted by the late Queen." Warrant for the above granted July 19.

The proclamation of this patent is preserved in the library of the Society of Antiquaries ; and following the proclamation is "The Copie of the Lord Treasourer's Letter," as under: — "After my heartie commendations, whereby it hath pleased his Majestie to direct a Privy Seal to me, touching the imposition of five shillings upon every grosse of Playing Cards that shall be Imported into this Kingdome or the Dominions thereof by vertue of his Majestie's Letters Patents granted to Sir Richard Coningsby knight under the Great Scale of England. In regard whereof These are to wil and require you to take notice thereof and not to suffer any merchant to make any entry of Playing-Cards until the same impositions be payed according to the same Letters patents Provided that the Patentees give caution for maintayning the Custome and Import according to a Medium thereof to be made as in such cases is used: And so having signified his Majestie's pleasure to you in that behalfe I bid you heartily farewell.  
"Your louing Friend,  
"ThO: SUFFOLKE.

"From Northampton House the 29th of October, 1615."  
The date usually taken, probably on the authority of Singer, for the original taxing of cards is 1631. It may be that he confused between the imposition of the tax, and the protest made against it in the reign of Charles I. The duty on cards was one of the taxes then complained of by the Commons "as arbitrary and illegal, and being levied without consent of Parliament."

In the reign of Queen Anne playing-cards were first subjected to a duty with the consent of Parliament. In 1710 an act was passed to obtain an annual sum of £186,670 as a fund or security for raising a sum of £2,602,200, " for carrying on the war, and for other her Majesty's Occasions." It was enacted that playing-cards should pay a duty of sixpence a pack for a term of thirty-two years, commencing June 11, 1711. Under the act, all makers of cards or dice were required to send to the Commissioners of the Stamp Duties on Vellum, parchment, and paper, notice in writing containing the address of the house or place where cards or dice were manufactured. Makers omitting to send such notice, or manufacturing in houses not notified, became liable to a penalty of £50. Various other vexatious obligations were imposed, as, for example, the makers had to permit the proper officers for the duties in question to enter their houses of business to " take an account of the cards and dice there made," on penalty of £10 for every refusal. The makers were not allowed to remove cards from the factory until the paper and thread enclosing every pack was sealed in such a manner as was satisfactory to the Commissioners of Duties, under pain of forfeiting the goods removed, and treble their value. In addition, the card and dice makers were required to make entry, upon oath, once in every twenty-eight days of the number of cards and dice manufactured by them in the interim, and they had to clear within the ensuing fortnight the amount of duty then declared due. Neglect on these scores was visited by forfeiture of £20 for default in making entry, and double duty for non-payment of the tax within the specified time.

The proposal to lay an impost on playing-cards encountered much opposition. Several petitions against the tax were presented to Parliament, by card-makers and importers of paper, which are sufficiently interesting to be quoted at some length : —

"Considerations in Relation to THE IMPOSITION ON CARDS, Humbly submitted to the Honourable HOUSE of Commons : —

Nine parts in ten of the cards now made are sold from 6s. to 24s. per gross, and even these six shillings in cards by this Duty are subjected to pay £3 12s. tax.

This with humble submission will destroy Nine Parts in Ten of this manufacture for those Cards which are now bought for 3s., can't then be afforded under 10d. or a shilling, for every hand through which they pass will add a gain in consideration of the Tax imposed and therefore the generality of the people will buy none at all.

" If any of your Honours hope by this Tax to suppress expensive Card-playing, It is answered, That the Common sort who play for innocent diversion will by this tax be only hinder'd ; for those sharp gamesters who play for money but do not use the Twentieth part of the Cards sold, will not by this Tax be discouraged ; for those who play for many Pounds at a game will not be hindered by paying 12d. per pack : And the destruction of this manufacture will be attended with these ill consequences : —

" *First.* Nothing (in comparison) will be (clear of all charges) raised by this duty imposed.

" *Secondly.* All that depend upon this manufacture will be rendered incapable to maintain their numerous families or pay their debts.

" *Thirdly.* The English paper manufacture (which is the middle of the Cards) will be extreamly prejudiced.

" *Fourthly.* The importation of the Genoa White Paper (with which the Cards are covered) will be very much diminished ; and in the consequence thereof,

" *Fifthly and lastly.* Her Majesty will lose as much Paper duty as the clear Duty on the Cards to be sold will amount unto.

" And if it be intended to charge the Stock in hand, then the present Possessors will be thereby obliged to pay a Duty for Ten times more Cards than ever they will sell.

" *Wherefore it is humbly hoped, That your Honours will not lay a Duty which ifs humbly conceived will bring no profit to the QuEEN, but inevitably ruin many hundreds of her subjects* "

The merchants importing Genoa paper and others followed suit in a similar strain: —

"The case of the Merchants Importing Genoa paper, the Stationers, Haberdashers of small ware, the English Paper-makers, and Card-makers.

"In relation to the Intended Duty on Cards, humbly submitted to the Honourable House of Commons."

The preamble with slight alterations proceeds as in the previous petition down to the end of the first " ill consequences," and then the petition continues as follows : —

"*Secondly.* The English Paper-Manufacture extremly prejudiced, because by a modest computation there are 150 Paper Mills in England and each of these one with another Annually make 400 Rheams ; one-Fourth of which is now used in the ordinary cards, and none of these will (when this great Duty is imposed) be ever made.

" *Thirdly.* Her Majesty's Customs arising from the Importation of Genoa Paper will be extremely lessen'd: for it is reasonably supposed that there are 40,000 Rheams of Genoa paper annually used in this manufacture, which already pays Custom 10d. per Rheam, amounting to ;£1,666 13s., which by this intended duty will be quite lost, the said Genoa paper being of little use but in Card-making.

" *Fourthly.* Three parts in four of the Card-makers, and the many families which depend upon them, will by this intended Tax be inevitably ruin'd, for those Card-makers depend upon their credit and work 8 months in 12 for the Winter-Season, and during those 8 months scarce receive enough to find their families with Bread, and therefore can never pay this *great Duty* and consequently not follow their trade.

"Seeing by this intended Duty her Majesty's loss in her Customs, the loss of the merchants importing paper, of the Stationers who credit the Card-makers, of the Wholesale Haberdashers wjio sell the Cards, and of the Card-makers, will amount to five times more than this designed imposition can clear of all charges be suppos'd to raise ; and five parts in six of the Card-makers and their numerous *Dependents* inevitably ruined.

"  *It is therefore humbly hop'd this* Honourable House *will give relief in the* Premisses."

The poor Card-makers and the Company of Card-makers also presented petitions against the tax, in language almost identical. The following is the petition known as that of the " poor " card-makers : —

" Reasons Humbly offer'd by the Card-makers against the Tax upon Playing-Cards.

" The Card-makers in and about the City of London are about One Hundred Master Workmen. For sometime past (Paper having been double the Price as formerly) the trade is much decayed.

" The most they sell their Cards for to the Retailers (one sort with another) is Three Half-pence the Pack and their Profit not above one Half-penny. So that the Tax intended will be double the value of the Cards and six times their gain.

" The generality of these Card-makers are Poor men and out of the Small Gains above can hardly main- tain their families: And therefore to impose a Tax to be immediately paid upon making by the Card- makers (whose Stocks and Abilities are so very mean, that they now make hard shift to forbear the Retailers the ordinary time of Credit) will be a direct way to Ruine these Poor Men.

" Besides there is at present a Stock of Cards in the retailers' hands sufficient for the consumption of Four or Five years ; and they will assuredly sell all the old stock off before they take any at the New advanced rate: The consequence whereof will be: —

" *First.* That the Card-makers till that stock be sold off can make no new ones.

" *Secondly.* That during that time their Families must needs starve.

" *Lastly.* That until the card-makers can make new ones no money can arise by such a Tax."

Her Majesty's "occasions," however, were such, that opposition was fruitless, and the Act became law. The duty was imposed on all cards " made fit for sale " during a certain term. In the following year it was found expedient, for the better securing the duties on playing-cards, and to prevent defrauding of the revenue, to amend this, and to enact that all stocks of cards which were fit for sale before the operation of the former act commenced, and which remained unsold in the hands of any person trading in cards, should be brought to the Stamp-office to be marked. On the traders making oath that the stocks so brought were actually made and finished before the 12th of June, 1711, they were entitled on payment of one half-penny per pack to have them sealed or stamped accordingly. All cards not brought to the Office before the 1st of August, 1712, were to be deemed to be made fit for sale after June, 1711, and to be charged with the full duty. And after July, 1712, no playing-cards were to be exposed for sale or used in play in any public gaming- house unless marked in conformity with the provisions of the act, both on the wrapper and on the spotted or painted side (now called the fore-side), of one of the cards of each pack.

By the same Act the regulations permitting the search entry of revenue officers to the houses of card-makers were extended to public gaming-houses ; and the notices required to be given by card-makers, and the clauses relating to the removal of unstamped cards, were amended and made more stringent. 
Offenders against these provisions were rendered liable to a penalty of £5 for every pack of unstamped cards found in their possession. It was also made felony, punishable with death, to counterfeit or forge the seals, stamps, or marks which denoted the payment of the duties. About ninety-five years ago the punishment of death was actually inflicted on an unfortunate engraver named Harding, who engraved a duty ace of spades to the order of a card-maker. The card-maker escaped from the country, or he would, in all probability, have shared the engraver's fate.

Despite the precautions and penalties enumerated, frauds on the revenue continued. Indeed, every enactment relating to playing-cards is accompanied by some reference to fraudulent practices with regard to the duties under the former act. It was now discovered that persons were in the habit, after cards had been used, of cutting out and tearing off the marks placed on the fore-side of playing-cards, for the purpose of affixing the same marks to fresh packs, and so of making one stamp serve over and over again. There was also a method contrived to render available for further use the seal and stamp upon the outside papers or wrappers. In order to check these proceedings a clause was introduced into an Act passed in 6 Geo. I. (1719) "for preventing frauds and abuses in the public revenues." A penalty of £10 was imposed on any person convicted of working up old stamps; and, when it was suspected that cards were being made up for sale in any private place (that is in any place of which the Commissioners of Stamps had not the usual written notice), power was given to the revenue officers, on a warrant being granted, to break open the doors of the suspected places, and to enter, and seize all " cards, dice, tools, and materials with which they are made."

Further, the term of thirty-two years over which the duty upon playing-cards was to remain in force was extended indefinitely.

Matters remained in the state described until 29 Geo. II. (1756), when an additional tax of sixpence a pack was imposed on playing-cards. As usual, the opportunity was taken to frame measures in expecta- tion of preventing the fraudulent evasions of the duty which still obtained. It transpired that great frauds were committed under pretence that cards were manufactured for exportation, such cards being exempt from duty. It was therefore enacted that all playing-cards intended for exportation should be distinguished by a particular wrapper, and that one card in each export pack should be marked with a special stamp. Cards wrapped and stamped as for exportation were not to be used in Great Britain, under a penalty of £20. A £20 penalty was also attached to the selling and buying of any covers or labels that had been already used.

It appeared also that the trick of selling slightly soiled playing-cards as " waste " was largely practised, to the detriment of the revenue. The soiled cards consisted of those so damaged in making as to be rejected by the manufacturers. They were purchased for a few pence per pound, chiefly by Jew speculators, who sorted them and disposed of them at a cheap rate. In order to put a stop to this system, all persons disposing of cards "commonly called waste cards " were required before sale to " mark the back or plain side of every painted or picture card in such manner as to render the same unfit to be used in play."

In the reign of George III. no less than seven Acts of Parliament were passed relating to cards and dice. All this legislation tended to two ends, — to impose additional duties, and to circumvent the evaders of the tax. It was more than suspected that the Inland Revenue officers were tampered with. A new plan was therefore resolved on. Hitherto the stamp had been impressed on the card made by the manufacturers, the card selected being generally, if not always, the ace of spades. But from and after the 5th July, 1765, makers of playing-cards were required to send to the Stamp Office the paper on which the ace of spades was to be impressed. The Commissioners of Stamps were to print the duty aces of spades themselves, and had a plate prepared for the purpose, with a device somewhat similar to that in use up to 1863, only less elaborate. The Commissioners had the power of altering the device at pleasure, in order to throw difficulties in the way of counterfeiting it. The card-makers were further required to send to the office the wrappers which they proposed to use for enclosing the cards. The wrappers were to have the maker's name printed on them, and were to be stamped with a sixpenny stamp. This stamp was not an additional duty. The duty still remained at one shilling: but the mode of imposition was varied, so that one half of the duty fell on the ace of spades, and the other half on the wrapper. At the same time, the penalty for refusing to allow inspection of premises where card-making was carried on, was raised from £20 to £50.

Eleven years later an additional duty of sixpence a pack was levied, making the total duty one shilling and sixpence.

In the meantime the ingenious enemies of the revenue had not been idle. The occupation of selling *waste* cards was gone ; but there was no prohibition against selling *second-hand* cards. Accordingly, the card-maker's waste was still sorted into packs, which were disposed of as second-hand cards, " to the great injury of the revenue." A penalty of £5 a pack was therefore imposed on any person selling second-hand cards, unless the backs of the picture cards were so marked as to render them unfit to be used in play.

In 1789, and again in 1801, the duty was further increased by sixpenny steps, till it reached the sum of half-a-crown a pack. The traffic in cards not duly stamped was powerfully stimulated by the high duty. Various evasive devices were invented, and more than one speculator amassed a large fortune by selling, under various pretences, cards on which no duty had been paid. Under the then arrangements, waste aces of spades could not be procured to any great extent, for the damaged aces were returned to the Stamp Office, and allowed for in the cardmakers' accounts. Packs, therefore, were made up for sale with a blank card in place of the ace of spades. Cut-corner cards, as they were called, *i.e.*, packs of cards of which one corner was cut off, and minus the ace of spades, were sold in immense quantities. Cards with a corner cut off, half an inch in depth, were considered by Parlia- ment sufficiently mutilated to render them unfit to be used in play. The public, however, put up with the inconvenience of using cut-corner cards rather than pay the high tax. In fact, the law was found powerless to prevent evasions ; every fresh enactment produced some fresh dodge for driving through it. It was therefore decided to diminish the duty, and to legalise, under certain restrictions, the sale of second-hand cards. In the year 1828, the half-a-crown duty was reduced to one shilling. The shilling duty was to be denoted on the ace of spades. This was the " duty one shilling " ace, called " Old Frizzle," on account of the elaborate flourishes which adorned it, with which all card-players, prior to 1864, were familiar. The aces were supplied on credit to the card-makers, the duty being exacted from time to time on their making up their packs for sale, when an officer had to attend to put on the wrappers, and to take an account of the numbers. Second-hand cards were permitted to be sold, except by licensed card-makers, provided the words "second-hand cards" were legibly printed or written on the wrapper.

Under the protection of this permission the sale of so-called second-hand cards flourished more vigorously than ever. The less scrupulous manufacturers used to make " works " of waste by the ton, for the purpose of sale under the name of second-hand cards. Indeed the clandestine manufacture of cards sold as second-hand was so extensive, that one person alone " owned to the sale of more unstamped packs in one year than the whole number which, according to the revenue returns, had been charged with duty in the same period, that is to say, upwards of 260,000 packs." Consequently, by 25 Vict. (June, 1862) the duty was fixed at three-pence per pack, the alteration to commence on ist September, 1862. The financial year ends 31st March, therefore in 1862, half the year the duty was one shilling, the other half three-pence. In the seventh Report of the Commissioners of Her Majesty's Inland Revenue, 1863, it is stated that the alteration from one shilling to three-pence .was made " in the hope of suppressing the enormous evasion of the duty which notoriously prevailed." At the same time that the amount was reduced, the form in which the duty was levied was altered. Several other reasons for the alteration are given in the Report. The Commissioners remark that " there were many disadvantages connected with these arrangements," [*i.e.*, with the arrangements which prevailed prior to 1863.] The principal disadvantages were the expense incurred in printing the aces, and the difficulty of adjusting the cardmakers' accounts. The cardmakers were always in arrear; they always had more aces supplied than were accounted for in the packs made up for sale ; and though the department had the power of taking an account of the stock not made up for sale, and held by the cardmakers, and of charging for aces not accounted for, the power was but occasionally exercised, on account of the practical difficulty of taking exact stock without serious incon- venience to the makers. Moreover, when stock was taken, a deficiency of aces always appeared, even with the most respectable makers, who were above the suspicion of intentionally defrauding the revenue. This deficiency was, in many instances, allowed to stand over, so that in practice the amount thus owing was as good as remitted. 
According to the statement of the Commissioners, it appeared that, " from the mode in which the ace of spades was necessarily prepared at the office, that important card was always different from the rest of the pack, and that this difference, though slight, was to those who were aware of it, readily perceptible by the touch," so that, in fact, the duty, "which was meant to be pro tanto a discouragement to gambling, was abetting the designs of the card sharper."

The difference here alluded to is as to the size of the card ; this might have been the case with small makers using imperfect machinery; but manufacturers of repute, who could properly manipulate the cards, were able to turn out the ace of spades precisely like the other cards as to size, thickness, and feel. 
The idea that the duty was meant to discourage gambling is purely imaginary. It was meant simply to increase the revenue in aid of Her Majesty's " occasions ;" and as was well pointed out in the petition presented to Parliament in the reign of Queen Anne, a tax only hinders the common sort who play for innocent diversion, and not sharp gamesters who play for many pounds a game.

Under the present system the ace of spades is free from duty, and is printed by the manufacturers in the same way as the other cards. The duty is now levied on the seal or wrapper in which each pack must be enclosed before it is sold ; and the duty applies to all full-sized playing-cards, whether new or second-hand. The wrappers are supplied from Somerset House as the card-makers require them, and have the name of the manufacturer printed on them.

Thus: suppose a new pack is opened and, as is the case at most clubs, is used only once. Under the old law the soiled pack was exempt from further duty if the words " second-hand cards " were legibly written or printed on the wrapper. Now, however, second- hand cards before being resold must be enclosed in a fresh wrapper and pay a second duty.

In 1861 the amount of duty received at one shilling a pack was £14,533, 290,660 packs being sealed. In 1862 — mostly at one shilling, but a small part at threepence — the duty produced ;£13,637, notwithstanding that about 160,000 more packs were sealed than before. When the new *régime* came into full operation in 1863, 732,960 packs were sealed, a very large increase when compared with the number stamped under the old régime*. Nevertheless, the receipts, owing to the reduction, amounted only to £9,i62, entailing a loss of about £4.450. After 1867, however, the number of packs sealed steadily increased, to 737,120, 813,920, 968,800, and so on; and in 1873 the number stamped was over a million. In 1877-78 the duty rose to £14,139, so that at the present time the smaller duty produces as much as the larger one did within a few pounds. And what is highly satisfactory is that there is no reason for supposing that there is now any evasion of the duty.

## Reaffirming the Law with Regard to Stamp Duty, 1804

Ever since the time of Queen Anne, in the early seventeen hundreds, the Ace of Spades was, quite literally, a marked card: becuase that card had to bear an official stamp. Stamp duty, a tax on every pack of playing cards, was levied on the wrapper that sealed each new pack of cards, but a stamp on the ace showed that the duty had been paid on that pack. From the mid-seevnteen hundreds, the hand stamp was replaced by an Ace that was printed by the official Stamp Office. Card makers printed 51 cards of the deck, but had to purchase the Duty Ace from the Stamp Office. The intricate design of the Ace of Spades stems from this period: it was an anti-fraud device. The card also include a plate number and the name of the maker. Only an official ace was allowed in a pack, and any printer fraudulently publishing the ace of spades card could be punished severely for it.

Very severely. In an Act of Parliament of 1804 updating stamp duty across a range of items, the act of defrauding the monarch by forging stamps used to identify duty as having been paid was judged to be a felony. Which is to say, if you were convicted, then you could expect to receive a death penalty.

If you read through old statutes, you are often likely to come across the phrase "without benefit of clergy" applied to to way in which certain offences are to be judged.

This refers to an old tradition whereby members of the clergy was allowed to submit themselves to the mercy of an ecclesiastical court, in a trial held under canon law, rather than a civil or King's court.

Police. —The Commissioners of the Stamp having discovered for a considerable time past a great falling off of the revenue, arising trom the taxation *of the Ace of Spades*, directed Mr Estcourt, their Solicitor, to endeavour to discover the cause, and he employed a number of men for that purpose; and it has been discovered that forged Aces of Spades, in Packs of Cards, have been circulated to an incredible number, particularly in the country. A number of their circulaters have been detected and apprehended, and have undergone several private examinations at the Public Office, Bow-street, before Mr Robinson. The particulars that transpired are, that they sold them under various pretences, and different prices, from 14s. to 24s. the dozen packs, and the venders of them by retail had found the sale of them to answer their purposes so well, that one in the country had given the forgers an order for an hundred dozen groce of packs. Yesterday several of them were fully committed for trial. It is a capital offence.

```

And so it was, that early in 1805, a certain Mr John Blacklin, along with two others, were arrested for selling packs of playing cards that included a forged Ace of Spades, thereby defrauding the King.

Three months later, at the end of April, 1805, they separately stood trial at the Old Bailey.

Blacklin was found guilty, but his legal representatives argued that the charge was mis-stated:

Saint James's Chronicle - Thursday 02 May 1805

_ OLD BAILEY—Monday, April 29.

*John Blacklin* was indicted for feloniously vending playing cards, having a forged Ace of Spades. It appears that he sold the cards in packs of 51 each; and in another pack he delivered as many forged Aces of Spades. The duty on a pack of cards is 2s. 6d. but the prisoner sold his cards at 14s. per dozen packs. It was argued, that the cards thus disposed of could not be deemed complete packs; but this objection was over-ruled, and the prisoner was found guilty, but was recommended to mercy.

Tuesday, April 30.  
*Maydewall* and *Knype* were indicted for uttering forged stamps on the Ace of Spades, knowing them to be so. The fact of uttering was completely proved ; but the prisoners in their defence declared their ignorance of the forgery, which the Jury gave credit to by a verdict of acquittal.

Ipswich Journal - Saturday 04 May 1805

Monday, at the Old Bailey, John Blacklin, of Queen-street, Cheapside was capitally convicted for vendings cards with a forged stamp (as an Ace of Spades.) The trial lasted 5 hours and a half. Two boys indicted with him were acquitted, having acted under his control. Blacklin is supposed to have gained 8000£ a year by this practice.
```

The two boys implicated in the case, Maydwell and Knype, were tried the following day.

The *J. Harding* mentioned in passing in relation to another case is presumably no relation to the *R. Harding* we will meet later, but his name is a foreshadow of things to come, and his story seems an interesting one!

Old Bailey. [Yesterday]... J. Harding, a dashing swindler, who has sometimes called himself Lord Hawke, was tried on a capital indictment for stealing gold watch from a shop in Bond-street; but appearing that the shopkeeper's apprentice had entrusted him with the watch, which he said he wished to shew to his brother, his depositing a fictitious bill for double the value, the capital part of the charge was done away, and was found guilty of simple felony.—J. Maydwell and J. Knype were tried for selling cards with a forged stamp of the ace of spades, in connection with Blacklin, capitally convicted on Monday: they declared their defence, that they thought the cards had been of French manufacture, and that they were engaged in a smuggling transaction only : the Jury gave them credit for this assertion, and they were accordingly acquitted.

OLD BAILEY. Yesterday, Blacklin, who was convicted of uttering a forged stamp on the ace of spades, was again placed in the Dock; Mr. SERGEANT BEST having, at his trial, suggested that, should he be convicted, he would submit to the Court an Arrest of Judgment on the informality of the indictment. Mr. GLEED, yesterday, supported the plea in favour of the Prisoner; and his arguments were replied to by Messrs. FIELDING, DAMPIER, and KNAPP, Counsel for the Crown. The RECORDER, however, did not deem it proper to decide on a point which involved the death of an individual, and the matter was consequently reserved for the opinion of the Twelve Judges. The judgment will of course be respited.

Morning Herald (London) - Wednesday 01 May 1805

OLD BAILEY. Monday.

*John Blacklin*  was indicted for feloniouly uttering and vending certain cards, with a forged or counterfeit stamp.—It was proved that the prisoner purchased considerable quantities of cards from a person named Lee, a Card-maker in Fetter-lane, - and resold them. Thecards were made up in packs, without the Ace of Spades, on which the stamp is placed, that card being always delivered separately. The forged stamp had the name Hart on it, and it appeared from the evidence, that no stamps had been issued from the Stamp-Office to that maker, bearing numbers higher than 80; whereas the numbers on the counterfeit stamps found in the possession of the prisoner, or sold by him, were 112, 113, 114; 115, and 116.

Mr. Sergeant Best stated an objection, founded on the Act of the 9th of Queen Ann, which requires the duties to be expressed on the wrapper; and contended that the subsequent Acts which mentioned the Ace of Spades, were only intended to distinguish between cards for exportation and those for home consumption.— Mr. CONST and Mr. GLEAD followed on the same side. The latter Gentleman maintained, thar as there were only 51 cards in each pack, the article charged by the indctment to be forged was imperfect, and therefore did not come within the meaning of the Act.— These objections were replied to by the SOLICITOR-GENERAL and Mr. GARROW, and , finally, over ruled by the Court.

Mr. Baron THOMPSON charged the Jury, who returned a verdict of *Guilty*, but recommended him to mercy, on account of his previous good chataaer.

Tuesday

*John Maydwell*, youth of 19, was indicted for selling and uttering cards with counterfeit stamps, knowing the same to be forged, with intent to defraud the Revenue. The Aces of Spades sold by, or found in the possession of the prisoner, were proved to be counterfeit by the same evidence yesterday adduced in the case of Blacklin.— The prisoner, in his defence, said, that he always understood the cards to have been imported from France, except the Aces of Spades, which, he believed, were procured from waste paper, purchased by the Neckinger Mill Company from the Stamp Office.— The Jury retired for a short time, and a returned a verdict of *Not Guilty*.

ISAAC MAYDWELL. Royal Offences; tax offences. 24th April 1805

354. ISAAC MAYDWELL was indicted for that he, on the 11th of February , feloniously did utter certain playing cards, liable to a stamp-duty, with counterfeit marks thereon, counterfeiting and resembling the impression of certain marks directed to be used by a certain Act of Parliament passed in the 29th year of his present Majesty, and several former Acts of Parliament denoting the duties granted to his Majesty for every pack of playing cards made fit for sale, he knowing them to be counterfeited .

And various other Counts for like offence.

(The indictment was read by Mr. Knapp, and the case was stated by Mr. Garrow.)

FRANCIS THEW sworn. - Examined by Mr. Fielding. I live at No. 4, Duke's-court, Drury lane.

Q. When were you first acquainted with the prisoner? - A. On the 8th of January last, I went to him at No. 6, Lovell's-court, Paternoster-row; I told him that I was informed by a person that he dealt in cards; he said he did, but he had but one pack; he let me have them; they were put up in white paper, I gave him two shillings for them; there were fifty-two in the pack, and the ace of spades I think was with them; I saw him afterwards on the 11th at the same place, and I told him I wanted a dozen packs; he took me to a house in Butcherhall-lane, where he knocked at the door; a girl answered the door, and she asked him if his name was Isaac; he said, yes; he asked for a parcel that was left for him, and she gave him the parcel without any more questions.

Court. Q. Did you know what it contained? - A. Yes, a dozen packs of cards; he then delivered them to me, and I paid him twenty-three shillings for them; I told him I was going out of town at that time, and requested his directions, which he gave me, and it is now on the directions of one of the parcels.

Mr. Fielding. Q. Look into that parcel, and see whether it is now as it was when it was delivered to you, and whether the aces of spades are not in a separate parcel to that? - A. Yes, it is; they correspond in number to them, but they are in separate parcels; I think I saw him again on the 17th in Lovell's-court; I applied to him then for two packs; I then went with him again to Butcherhall-lane; he asked for Mr. Knipe; they said he was not there; then he said he must go to the office; he took me with him to the Bull and Mouth inn; he desired me to wait in the street; he went into the inn, and brought the two packs to me, all but the aces of spades; he said he must go and get the aces of spades; then I went with him to the house of Mr. Read, in Hosier-lane, a cloth-presser; after he had been in a little time, he called to me, while I was waiting in the street; I went in and paid him there two shillings a pack for them, and there I received the aces. On the 29th I saw him again in Lovell's-court; he took me again to Butcherhall-lane, and there I saw Mr. Knipe; he asked for two packs of cards, and Mr. Knipe handed him out two parcels of cards, which he gave me. I saw him again on the 6th of February in Lovell's-court; I applied for two dozen then; these are them.

Q. Are the aces of spades made up in a separate parcel, and correspond in number to the two dozen packs - open them? - A. Yes, they are; I paid him forty-five shillings for them; I saw they were in separate parcels after I got home; I had before observed the name of Hart being on the aces; I mentioned it to him; the reason of my observation to him was, because he had told me they were French cards; he told me that was an illusion, they were French cards.

Q. What may be the price of a pack of cards now, or at the time you bought these? - A. Four shillings a pack.

Court. Q. You mean the fair price with the duty? - A. Yes.

Mr. Fielding. Q. In consequence of information, you went on purpose to purchase these cards? - A. Yes; I saw him again on the 16th of February, I went for two dozen; I went to the Bull and Mouth inn with him; I saw Knipe there; Maydwell said then he would get three dozen, and leave them with Mr. Knipe for me, as he was going out of town.

Q. He made an appointment with you on the 3d of March? - A. He was to meet me at the house of Mr. Pocock, No. 43, Eagle-street; I had told him that was my lodgings.

Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You had not been acquainted with him prior to the month of January - it was only then that you were taken into this awkward service? - A. No.

Q. You depend upon the bounty of the Stamp-office? - A. No bounty at all; I expect to be paid for my time and trouble.

EDWARD WRIGHT sworn. - Examined by Mr. Dampier. Q. Are you a playing-card maker? - A. Yes, I worked for Lee, No. 42, Fetter-lane.

Q. How many gross of cards did Mr. Lee make a month? - A. From fifteen to sixteen gross a month.

Q. Were all these cards made with aces got from the Stamp-office? - A. No, he might make perhaps a gross a month with aces from the Stamp-office; he used aces of spades that he got elsewhere, that were forged.

JOSEPH REYNOLDS sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am a card-maker; I worked for Thomas Lee , in Fetter-lane.

Q. What stamps did you use? - A. Stamps that Mr. Lee procured in general; now and then stamps from the Stamp-office.

Mr. Alley. Q. Do you know the difference between a forged stamp and a good one? - A. Yes.

Q. And you were so wicked as to do it? - A. I was only a servant.

Q. Do not you know that a servant is not forced to commit a felony if his master does - were not you taken into custody? - A. I surrendered.

THOMAS ROW sworn. - On the 6th of March I went to Pocock's, No. 43, Eagle-street, and I took the prisoner into custody with these seven parcels of cards; they appear to be fifty-one; in one parcel the aces are separate; I saw him knock at the door, and I seized him directly.

CHARLES- EDWARD BERRESFORD sworn. - Examined by Mr. Garrow. Q. You are Secretary to the Stamp-office? - A. Yes.

Q. Do you know from the documents of the Stamp-office when Hart ceased to be a card-maker? - A. I do not know; I have searched the books, and I find his highest number was 80, (looking at the ace: of spades found at Thew's, sold by Maydwell,) they are all forged; they have an imitation of the real ones from the Stamp-office, and these numbers are from 112 to 116.

WILLIAM PRITCHARD sworn. - Examined by Mr. Garrow. I am the officer that delivers the legal aces of spades to the different card-makers; the name of the card-maker is inserted on each duty ace; I never deliver the name of one card-maker to another.

Q. Are they constantly delivered in this form, twenty in a sheet? - A. Yes, never in any other way; I knew Hart very well, he ceased card-making on the 13th of November, 1797; he failed, and I was in possession of all his duty aces that were at his manufactory, and I brought them to the Office.

Mr. Alley. Q. You know that a great number had been sold to the Neckinger Mill Company? - A. I do not know that, I have heard so.

Mr. Garrow. Q. Whatever might have been transacted between the Neckinger Mill Company and the Stamp-office, could the Neckinger Mill Company have received forged aces from the Stamp-office? - A. I apprehend not.

Court. Q. Every card-maker has the aces stamped on his paper; his name is likewise inserted on every ace? - A. Yes.

Q. And Lee cannot have Hart's stamps, and Hart cannot have Lee's? - A. Certainly not.

Prisoner's defence. I have always considered them as French cards; I have always bought and sold them as such.

The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.

NOT GUILTY .

Q. What made you apply to him and not to Maydwell, when Maydwell was to have given them to you? - A. Maydwell was gone out of town.

Q. Had there been at any time any conversation with the prisoner; had he given you to understand that you should make application to him -

Mr. Gurney. Q Had you any conversation with the prisoner about this? - A. The last time that I saw Maydwell, before he went out of town.

Q. How long was that before the sixteenth of February? - A. I think that was on the last parcel that I got from Maydwell.

Mr. Fielding. Q. That was on the sixteenth of February? - A. It was. Maydwell told Knipe to let me have the three dozen at different times; when he wanted he said he would if he could; he parted from us and I saw no more of him at that time.

Q. Did you see him again on the 21st of February? - A. Yes.

Q. Where was it that you saw him? - A. At the Bull and Mouth I saw Knipe.

Q. What passed with you and him on the 21st? - A. I went for the purpose of purchasing two dozen packs, one of these dozens was part of them which Maydwell had left for me; he said he had not so many.

Mr. Fielding Q. On the first of March had you any other transaction with him? - A. I went for the purpose of getting two dozen and two packs.

Q. Where did you go? - A. I went to Butcherhall-lane, to his house.

Q. When was it that you had the conversation with him respecting the cheapness of the cards; was that between the 16th of February and the 1st of March? - A. Yes, it was; we were conversing upon that and other things; upon which he asked me about the cards, whether I knew that they were forged, or whether I thought that they were forged, I cannot say which, it is a very hard thing to swear upon; I answered, no; I think he said, well, but they are; I was very much flurried at the time he mentioned that they were forged; I think that was the word.

Q. You then looked at the ace of spades, you saw the manner it was stamped upon the cards, you observed the name of the card-maker; what stated you to him about the name of Hart? - A. I never mentioned that to him.

Q. When you received your directions from the gentlemen of the Stamp-Office, directing you to purchase cards, did you know any thing of the forgery? - A. I did not know any thing of the forgery, but I suspected it.

Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. I think you told us that you were at Mr. Wheeler's, a card-maker, are you in his employ? - A. Yes, as clerk, from the beginning of January.

Q. You have had a great deal of knowledge in cards from the beginning of January - Does he deal in a large way? - A. Not very large, equal with others.

Q. You undertook this on purpose of serving Mr. Wheeler, and now you hope, or you are expecting, to serve yourself, how old are you? - A. Nineteen.

Q. A promising youth, the prisoner must have been an old acquaintance of your's? - A. No.

Q. Not acquainted with him, when Maydwell introduced you to him he was a man that put his life into your hands; there was something so inviting in your face, and you would have us believe, though you went to him twice, and purchased cards of him, that is the story you come here with, and you not being acquainted with him, you had been buying of him, and buying of Maydwell, and you did not know they were forged? - A. I did not know they were forged.

Q. You had bought of him the aces of spades separate from the other cards; you likewise knew what the duty was upon a pack of cards; that it was half a crown a pack; you being conversant with card-making, you knew that the sheets came from the Stamp-office not in this way; that the duty was half a crown a pack, and this came from the Stamp-office in this manner, and was so used by card makers, and put up together, and you did not know that they were forged? - A. I did not know that they were forged.

Q. Did you believe then that the stamp upon the aces of spades that you bought, came from the Stamp-office? - A. I did not believe it; I suspected it to be wrong, I did not positively know that they were forged, I suspected they were wrong.

Q. You suspected there was some fraud, and therefore you could not believe them to come from the Stamp-office? - A. No.

Q. Then I want to know if you did not believe them to be forged, and not to come from the Stamp-office, what third place there was? - A. I could not tell, I suspected them to be forged.

Q. Did you or did you not believe them to be forged? - A. I could not tell, I suspected them to be forged.

Q. Did not you believe them to be forged? - A. I believed (if believing is the same as thinking) them to be forged.

Q. Then if any question was asked you, who was conversant with cards, by this young man, who is rather younger than yourself, did you give him any information on the subject - If he ever asked you how people could afford to sell them so cheap, did you ever give him any information on the subject? - A. No.

Q. Did you ever ask him how they could make these cards in France, and afford to sell them so cheap? - A. I have not the least recollection.

Q. Will you swear that? - A. I never did.

Court. Q. You do not recollect that you ever did? - A. No.

Mr. Gurney. Q. You have been telling my friends at my left hand that he took you to Butcherhall-lane - Upon your oath, was not that Maydwell's lodging, and not the prisoner's - Will you swear it was his lodging? - A. To the best of my knowledge it was his lodging; the prisoner told me that he kept cards there, and that he had a room for the purpose of keeping them.

Q. Pray was that the same house that you went to with Maydwell? - A. There were two houses, one No. 15, and Mr. Knipe and the people of that house removed to No. 7.

Q. The place that you have described, was that the place where Maydwell lodged? - A. No, Maydwell lodged at No. 6, Lovell's court, Paternoster-row; Maydwell went and got them from Knipe.

Q. Do you mean to repeat the same thing, that you do not expect any sort of reward for all this? - A. I never expected it from the first; I expect to be paid for my time.

Q. That you heard from my friends speech, I wish I had put you out of Court at the time; then you would have us to believe, that you went for the purpose of bringing Lee to justice; that was what you bought the cards for, not expecting any sort of reward for yourself? - A. Upon my oath, I did not,

Mr. Fielding Q. The first object which you set out with, was to bring Lee to justice? - A. It was.

EDWARD CARTWRIGHT sworn. - Examined by Mr. Dampier. Q. You are an officer? - A. Yes, I apprehended the prisoner on the sixth of March, at the Bull and Mouth, Bull and Mouth street.

Q. Did you search him? - A. Yes, I did.
Q. Did you find any cards in his pocket? - A. None in his pocket; in his box, in his apartment, I found one pack.

Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. What part was it? - A. In a room, in the Bull and Mouth inn; I gave those cards to Mr. Chetham, he was also with me, and I searched in Butcherhall-lane, No. 7; I found some cards there; I produce them; they are in the same state as I found them.

Court. Q. What quantity of cards are there? - A. Nine packs.

Q. Who told you it was his lodgings? - A. When I took the prisoner he took me to his lodgings with Mr. Chetham.

Mr. Dampier. Q. Were there any duty aces with these cards? - A. None in these nine.

JAMES CHETHAM sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp.

Q. Did you go with the last witness to the prisoner's lodging? - A. Yes, I did, and to his lodging-room at the Bull and Mouth inn.

Q. The prisoner was the book-keeper at the Bull and Mouth inn? - A. He was one of the book-keepers in the coach-office.

Q. Did the last witness give you any thing when you were there? - A. I was present when the box was opened; I asked him whether that was his box; he said it was; I then desired the officer to search it; Cartwright searched it, and found one pack of cards, and he delivered them to me; these are the cards, I have had them ever since in my possession; I marked the ace of spades with my initials.

Q.(To Mr. Beresford.) This impression was made at your office, from a plate prepared by the authority of the Commissioners, for Hart, the card-maker, and look at the other aces produced by Thew, what is the number upon that? - A. No. 116.

Q. Have you searched the documents of your office? - A. Yes, and I find no one higher than 80.

Q.(To Mr. Merchant) Will you look at the first parcel which Thew produced? - A The numbers are all higher than 80; they are from 112 to 116.

Q. Do they appear to be a general imitation, and to have a general resemblance of the genuine one; you are the engraver at the Stamp-office? - A. Yes, they are in imitation.

Q Look at that Mr. Chetham found? - A. They are all forgeries.

Q. What numbers do you find upon these? - A. They are all higher than 80; they are from 112 to 116.

- PRITCHARD sworn. - Examined by Mr. Fielding. Q. You are the overseer, you deliver out these things to the card-makers? - A. I am.

Q. Did you know a card-maker of the name of Hart? - A. Very well.

Q. For a considerable while have you delivered out any in his name? - A. None since the year 1797.

Q. I do not know whether you know of your own knowledge how high his number went? - A. No.

Q. Is that from the Stamp-office? - A. I have no hesitation to say it is forged.

Q. The plates are delivered to the makers whose name they bear? - A. Always.

Q. So that the plates of Lee would not be delivered to Hart, nor the plates of Hart to Lee? - A. No, they have been delivered by me for a great number of years, and I never delivered one to the name of another card-maker.

Prisoner's defence. Thew was introduced to me as a mere stranger by Maydwell; I should have been very imprudent to have told a person I had never seen before that the cards I sold were forged; I never acknowledged to any person that they were forged, because I never knew it.

The prisoner called one witness, who gave him a good character.

Mr. Garrow. It is one of the sheets of duty aces stamps which he used to work up at Lee's. These that were worked up at Lee's contained only ten on each sheet, and the other, the legal sheet of duty aces stamps, contained twenty.

Q. Did the prisoner apply occasionally for cards that he had ordered? - A. Yes.

Q. Was that occasioned by the want of cards generally or the want of duty aces? - A. Sometimes the demand was so large that we had not got the cards generally, and sometimes, when we had got the rest of the cards, the aces were wanting.

Q. Had you ever any conversation with the prisoner on that subject? - A. Yes, I have.

Q. What passed then between him and you? - A. I have told him that the aces were out, we had got none in the house.

Q. Was there ever an occasion happened when you stood still till the plate was engraved? - A. Yes.

Q. Do you know whether at that time the prisoner's orders were unexecuted for want of the aces? - A. He told me so; that he wanted aces of spades, and he could not execute the orders because he had not the aces to put to them; and the orders he had delivered they would not give him the money for them till he had furnished the aces of spades; I told him not to blame my master for it, as the man who had the doing of it had disappointed him.

Q. Give us your very expression as you used in your conversation with him at that time, or any other time about a plate? - A. I do not recollect that I told him any thing about a plate; no more than what I have observed to the man that had the doing of it.

Q. The aces that are furnished when the duties are regularly paid are obtained at the Stamp-Office, are they not? - A. Yes.

Q. So that no man, except the person employed by the Stamp-Office, have any thing to do with them till they are delivered to the card-maker? - A. No.

Q. Are these regularly and immediately furnished upon application at the Office? - A. Yes.

Q. The duty aces which are delivered from the Stamp-Office, do not they always contain the card-maker's name? - A. Always.

Q. Therefore any that had been issued from the Stamp-Office, your master would have had his name upon them? - A. Yes.

Q. I observe that these you have produced, as manufactured at Lee's, have the name of Hart upon them - Was there any maker at the time you were employed by Lee, of the name of Hart, that you were acquainted with? - A. No, none at all.

Q. Are you pretty well acquainted with the makers in town? - A. Yes, I know them.

Q. And I suppose you have worked for many of them - Did you know Hart when he was in the trade? - A. Yes.

Q. Do you know how long ago it is since he left off? - A. I believe about seven years.

Q. So that if he had been in the trade, it is probable

you should have known it? - A. I certainly should.
Q. When the prisoner visited Lee's house occasionally, did he come where you passed? - A. We pasted backwards, he very seldom came there, he was sometimes there.

Q. He came sometimes there, while you were actually pasting these plates, which are half the size of the legal plates? - A. I do not recollect seeing him there while we were in the act of doing it.

Q. What price did he pay Lee for the cards he had bought of him? - A. I do not rightly know.

Q. Had you ever any conversation with Blacklin about it? - A. I have heard Blacklin say that my master charged him too much.

Q. Do you happen to know from Blacklin himself what his selling price was, when he was stating to you that your master charged him too much for them - Do you know what he sold them at himself? - A. No.

JOSEPH REYNOLDS sworn. - Examined by Mr. Garrow. Q. Are you a card-maker? - A. Yes.

Q. Did you work for Lee? - A. Yes.

Q. Do you know the prisoner Blacklin? - A. Yes.

Q. Was he a customer of Lee's? - A. Yes.

Q. Did he deal to a large amount? - A. Yes, he used to be one of Mr. Lee's principal customers.

Q. How many gross a month did Lee make? - A. I suppose about thirteen or fourteen gross per month.

Q. I do not know whether you happen to know what the duty would be, if they were bought at the Stamp-Office? - A. Half a crown a pack.

Q. And he would make about thirteen gross per month. -

Mr. Gibbs. Three thousand two hundred and forty-two pounds a year, and more than that.

Mr. Garrow. Q. Did Mr. Lee use some legal stamps? - A. He did.

Q. Did he use some that were not legal stamps? - A. Yes.

Q. What proportion did one bear to another? - A. He very seldom used more than one hundred and forty packs per month.

Q. And the prisoner was his principal customer? - A. Latterly he was.

Q. Were they upon the footing of intimacy? - A. Yes.

Q. Upon some occasion you supped together with him? - A. I did, in Christmas week.

Q. You and Lee supped at Blacklin's house with him? - A. Yes.

Q. Were those sheets in the name of Hart, the sheets that you used to work up for the greatest part of your trade? - A. Yes, they were.

Q. This is from the same impression? - A. Yes.

Q. Were all sold to the prisoner at the bar, Mr. Blacklin, made with these aces? - A. Yes.

Q. What we call, at the present, forged aces? - A. Yes.

Q. From your own knowledge of aces do you know whether these are legal or forged? - A. They are not legal, they are forged.

Q. And all that Lee sold to Blacklin were of that manufactory? - A. Yes.

Q. Are not the cards, with the card denoting the stamp-duty of the card-maker, generally issued in this form, with the paper stamp on the wrapper? - A. Yes.

Q. He is bound to do it under a penalty, and indeed a man buying them, without that, subjects himself to a penalty - Were any of these cards that were sold by Lee to Blacklin issued in this form? - A. I never saw any.

Q. Look at these - Is that the form in which they were always delivered? - A. Yes, in a white wrapper.

Q. Were the aces of spades delivered in that wrapper, or in separate parcels? - A. Always in separate parcels by themselves.

Q. Did you hear the prisoner complain at any time, either in, or not in, Lee's presence, that his orders were not executed speedy enough? - A. Never before me.

Q. Had you ever any conversation before you on that subject? - A. Never.

NATHANIEL MERCHANT sworn. - Examined by Mr. Fielding. Q. You are the Inspector of the Stamp-Office? - A. Yes.

Q. How old are you, sir? - A. Seventy-two.

Q. Just look at that thirty-six dozen and the corresponding aces (Lee's aces) that were found at Boddington's? - A. There are seventy-two, and each corresponds to the thirty-six dozen.

Q. For what number of years have you been an Inspector? - A. About four years.

Q. From inspecting these aces, are you able to say whether they are from any instrument issued at the Stamp-Office? - A. They certainly did not come from the Stamp-Office.

Court. Q. What aces are they? - A.(Mr. Fielding.) Part of the parcel marked B. containing seventy-two aces, being part of what was found at Boddington's.

Mr. Fielding. Q. Look them all over, Mr. Merchant; are you enabled to say what they are? - A. They are all of them forged, Mr. Hart has not gone beyond the number 80; I mean, there has been, I believe, no aces issued from the Stamp-Office, in the name of Hart, beyond the number of 80; these are 112, 113, 114, 115, and 116.

Mr. Solicitor General. Q. Genuine ones, in the name of Hart, never exceeded the number 80.

Q. What are the other seven aces found at Boddington's? - A. They are all a forgery, and they

are from the same plate, and the same numbers, from 112 to 116.
Q. The paper 8, containing 59 aces of spades, what are they? - A. These are the same, and appear from the same impression, and contain the same number; the paper marked B contains six aces, they are forged; and the plate E is a forgery, containing fifty-four aces: they appear to be from the same plate.

Q. The one that was in the pocket-book of the prisoner, the ace of spades which the officer took out of the pocket-book, which was in his pocket and on his person, look at that, and tell me whether that is a forgery; it is in the name of Hart? - A. It is the same, and marked 112, a higher number than Hart ever had.

Mr. Garrow. Q. We now shew him the two papers marked Edward Wright , which Wright said he brought from Mr. Lee's manufactory - Do these appear to you to be a forgery, and to resemble those you have already looked at in these cards? - A. Yes.

Q. Are they imitations, and do they bear resemblance to those which were issued by the Stamp-Office? - A. Certainly they are an imitation of those which were issued by the Stamp-Office while Hart was in the trade, but the numbers do not agree.

Cross-examined by Mr. Serjeant Best. Q. Were you engraver at the Stamp-Office at that time? - A. No, I have examined the books, I find none higher than 80, and I have heard from my predecessor.

Q. You do not know that of your own knowledge; your only reason for believing these are forgeries is there are higher numbers, which somebody has told you are higher than Hart ever had? - A. Certainly these numbers do not correspond with the numbers belonging to Hart at the Stamp-Office.

Q. You do not know, you not being engraver at the Stamp-Office at that time; there may be other plates besides those which you have seen. -

Mr. Garrow. Q. I now shew him a genuine plate, a sheet containing twenty impressions, with the name of Hart on them; look at that and look at the ten; and look whether those of the ten, found at Lee's with the name of Hart - Do they appear to be made with a view to imitate them? - A. They are done to imitate.

Q. From your inspection of the legal one of twenty, and the other of ten impressions on Lee's paper, do they appear to be done with imitation of the genuine plates issued by the Stamp-Office? - A. Yes.

CHARLES- EDWARD BERRESFORD sworn. - Examined by Mr. Garrow. Q. You are Secretary to the Stamp-Office, you have been so sometime? - A. From the year 1801.

Q. Before that time you were Deputy Secretary? - A. Yes, and I was First Clerk for a great many years.

Q. And you are conversant with the business I take it for granted? - A. Yes; the aces are issued from the plates in sheets.

Q. How many in a sheet? - A. There are twenty in a sheet.

Q. Do you remember the time when Hart was card-maker? - A. Yes.

Q. Look at this sheet, and tell me whether this sheet is from the plate engraved for Hart? - A. It is the same as was used by Hart.

Q. Have you searched the office books, to see how high Hart's numbers went? - A. I have, I do not find that they went higher than 80.

Q. If they had gone higher than 80, must not you have found it in your search? - A. From the search I do not find any above 80, and I have searched with all the diligence I can.

Q. Is the person who was engraver at the time Hart was a maker living or dead? - A. Dead.

Q. Mr. Merchant succeeded him? - A. Mr. Merchant was his assistant for some time, and afterwards succeeded him.

Cross-examined by Mr. Serjeant Best. Q. You say probably there may be numbers above 80? - A. I cannot say whether there are or not.

Court. Q. You have said you searched? - A. Yes, I cannot find any above 80; I cannot say any thing respecting the cards.

Q. Have you searched the Stamp-Office with your best diligence, to find whether there are any above 80? - A. I find none beyond 80, there is no record beyond 80.

Q. Have you searched any of the warrants? - A. I have only searched the books.

Mr. Solicitor General. Q. They are regularly entered in the book? - A. They are.

Q. You find no entry beyond 80? - A. I have not.

Q. If there had been must not you have found them in your searching? - A. I think so; I have gone from 1765 up to 1800; I have searched all that period, and there are none higher than 80.

Q. You do not believe there are any higher than 80? - A. No.

Q. Have you any reason to believe or suspect there are any beyond 80? - A. No.

Mr. Serjeant Best. Q. You said you had not got the warrants of the Commissioners of the Office, to see if there were any plates ordered beyond 80; you have not been furnished with these warrants? - A. No.

Mr. Garrow. Q. Would not those warrants have enabled you to make a better search; what do you mean by not having the warrants? - A. I have only examined the entry of the order-book.

Q. The entry in the order-book is a transcript of the warrants? - A. Yes.
Mr. Serjeant Best. Q. What book have you examined? - A. Only the order-book.

Q. Will you take upon you to swear that there are no higher numbers? - A. To the best of my belief there are no higher numbers than 80.

Mr. Solicitor General. Q. The person to whom the warrants were delivered was the engraver you know? - A. Yes.

Q. Whenever there is a warrant of that sort made, there is an entry made of the order, and a specimen of the stamp afterwards taken; you have seen no entry beyond 80? - A. No.

Court. Q. The person to whom this warrant is given is the engraver, and the order of that engraving is entered in the book, and you have searched that book? - A. Yes.

Q. And when the engraving is made there is an impression taken from it and kept? - A. Yes.

Q. And you find no order of the engraving, nor any impression? - A. There is no order of engraving, nor any impression in that book.

JAMES CHETHAM sworn. - Examined by Mr. Garrow. Q. Where did you find that account? - A. In the prisoner's accompt book.

Q. This is Boddington's account, called waste paper; this you found at the prisoner's house? - A. I did. After his books were brought to Bow-street I examined them in the presence of the Magistrate, and in the presence of the defendant.

Court. Q. Whose book is this? - A.(Mr. Garrow.) The prisoner's, which Rivett has spoken of.

Mr. Chetham. I found this accompt in the green book, in the ledger.

Mr. Garrow. This is the accompt which Boddington said he wrote, stating the transaction between him and the prisoner, and found in the ledger.

(Read in Court.) Dtr. Mr. Blacklin with T. Boddington. - On the debtor side is cash, 5 l. - 26 draft, 24 l. 16 s. - 8 pans - 17 draft, Mr. Seck, 21 l. On creditor side, Jan. 16, ban, one cants. of Co. - February 3d, 10 compts, 4 yellows, 28 l. 13 s. one pans, 2 l. 2 s. - 36 dozen, W. P. in red ink - 14 with a stroke, 25 l. 4 s. - and two books, 5 s. The whole of that 36 dozen is in red ink, except the sum, the 14 with a stroke is with red ink, and all this carried out with a stroke in common ink.

Mr. Garrow. I will just shew one of the forged cards; you will see the forged card has not the additional duty at the bottom; at the bottom of the forged card there is nothing but the word Hart; on the legal one there is the word additional duty.

Prisoner's defence. At the time that I received these cards, I did not know that there were any aces of spades that were forged, I understood that they were foreign cards brought from abroad; I shortly after was informed that a large quantity of waste paper had been sold to the Neckinger Mill Company about two years ago, and which I have always since understood; the Neckinger Mill Company purchased at Somerset-house these aces amongst the quantities of waste paper which they purchased at Somerset-house.

Mr. Serjeant Best. Q.(To Mr. Shelton.) Will you have the goodness to read the 1st and 7th Counts. - (Read in Court.)

The Jurors upon their oath present, that John Blacklin , on the 26th of February, in the 45th year of his present Majesty's reign, with force and arms, feloniously did utter certain playing cards, liable to a stamp duty, with counterfeit marks thereon, counterfeiting and resembling the impression of certain marks directed to be used by virtue of a certain Act of Parliament, made in the 29th year of our Sovereign Lord the King, and several former Acts of Parliament, purposely denoting the duties granted to his Majesty on cards, made fit for sale, and used in Great Britain; that he, the said John Blacklin , on the 26th of February as aforesaid, feloniously did utter playing cards with such counterfeited marks thereon, he knowing the said counterfeited marks to be forged.

The said Jurors present, that the said John Blacklin , on the 26th of February, in the 45th year aforesaid, did feloniously vend and sell divers playing cards, liable to a stamp duty, with counterfeited marks on the spotted side of the said cards, counterfeiting an impression of certain marks directed to be used by a certain Act of Parliament, made at Westminster, in the 29th year of his Majesty's reign, entitled an Act for granting to his Majesty several additional stamp duties on cards and dice, and several former Acts of Parliament, relating to cards made fit for sale in Great Britain.

Mr. Serjeant Best. I take this to be the most convenient time to state my objections, and to make an arrest of judgment, if the case should require it, as it does not appear to me that this offence is particularly described by either of these Counts.

The evidence that we have heard does not prove any offence within this Act of Parliament upon which this indictment is framed, the 29th of George the Third; the words are, that if any person shall counterfeit, or forge, or procure to be forged or counterfeited, or vend and sell any stamp or mark to be used relating to cards, dice, or newspapers, or shall counterfeit or resemble the same, with such counterfeit marks thereon, knowing the same to be counterfeited, shall be guilty of felony.

Your Lordship will see that they are, by another Act of Parliament, directed to apply this stamp not upon any of the cards, but upon the wrapper; the statute I allude to is the 9th of Ann, chap. 28, sect. 41, there the Commissioners are directed to put this stamp on the wrapper of these cards. I submit to your Lordship, it may be said that subsequent Acts of Parliament have added additional duties, still if the original statute of Ann is not repealed, whatever number of duties may be added, the stamp must be in the same place, and in the same manner, as it is pointed out by the said Act of Parliament; and any stamp put in any other manner, is a stamp which the Commissioners are not authorized to put on. I submit to your Lordship, as it appears to me, this man did not vend any of these stamps upon wrappers, nor any stamp upon cards, and if the Commissioners are authorized, by any subsequent Act of Parliament, to put the stamp upon a particular card, then this indictment has not made out the case, because this indictment is not for the offence of putting the stamp upon a particular card. I desired these two Counts to be read, and your Lordship will find that it is both uttering and vending stamps, not upon a particular card, but stamps upon playing cards.

Mr. Gleed. If I understand the meaning of the word cards right, it must be a perfect pack of cards; the uttering of any one card would not be a felony within the meaning of this Act of Parliament, but by making use of the word playing cards. We must likewise see what the Legislature thought proper to impose upon selling such cards. The duty has been imposed upon a pack of playing cards, it is so stated upon the face of this indictment to be playing cards, and the evidence has been, in this case, of uttering cards without the aces of spades. The cards, without the aces of spades, cannot be considered as playing cards, nor can the ace of spades sold by itself at any time be said to be playing cards. In all cases of forgery, it is necessary that the forged instrument should be in all parts the similitude of the true; in this case there arises an objection, namely, it does not appear to be a pack of cards within the meaning of the words in this Act of Parliament, nor is it that which upon the face of the indictment it charges the prisoner with. It charges the prisoner with uttering, vending, and selling playing cards, when, in point of fact, the only evidence that has been introduced on the part of the prosecution have only supported the sale of a parcel of fifty-one cards, and not a pack of cards.

Mr. Solicitor General. It has been stated to your Lordship, that we cannot possibly support this indictment that charges the prisoner with having sold cards with counterfeit stamps, which must mean a counterfeit stamp on the wrapper; for the learned Serjeant says there is no Act justifies any stamp upon these cards. The 9th of Ann, which directs stamps to be put on the wrapper, which is true, but my answer is a positive denial on the fact, from subsequent Acts of Parliament on the case, which he had either forgotten or omitted. The 10th of Ann, chap. 19, sect. 162, it is enacted, that on one card in each pack shall be marked on the spotted side thereof. Your Lordship will go to the 5th of George the Third, chap. 46, sect. 9, which I do not find to be repealed, it there directs the Commissioners to provide a new stamp for the wrapper. No, for the ace of spades, and to make distinction between those meant for home consumption and those for exportation, and then it directs that which has always been observed by the Stamp Office, and which they have been studiously attentive to, that one of the sixpenny duties shall be denoted on the wrapper, and another also is directed to be put on the wrapper, and one of these sixpenny duties is also directed to be denoted on the ace of spades. I am not sure that any former Act mentions the ace of spades, but the 10th of Ann having directed it to be on the spotted side of one of the cards, and practice has continued it on the ace of spades. The next argument that fell from a learned friend of mine was, that the Act which prohibits the selling of playing cards with counterfeit stamps, must mean to prohibit vending packs of cards with counterfeit stamps, and that there is no evidence in this case of the vending a pack of cards, only a parcel of fifty-one, and that therefore this case is not within the Act. Certainly, without deviating from the indulgence which is permitted to the Counsel of a prisoner, I might have interrupted him when he was addressing your Lordship, though in fact he was addressing the Jury, when he was stating that there was not sufficient evidence to go to a Jury. Your Lordship will see there is not only evidence, but decisive evidence, and the fact is most certain, that the packs are sold in this way: - If I was to sell a dozen, containing each fifty-one in one parcel, and I sell another parcel containing twelve aces of spades, which two parcels together make twelve packs, if it was necessary to prove his selling these cards, and delivering them in this way, there is no doubt from the evidence. In the first place, do they bargain for cards containing each fifty-one? No; they bargain for a gross, or packs of cards; what or how much a dozen, for what is a dozen parcels of cards without the aces of spades? No, they include the aces of spades, there is no additional price for the aces of spades that these people were to pay, I will prove it by Boddington, who bought thirty-six dozen, and the evidence has said they would not pay for the cards, they would not pay the man till he had sent out the aces of spades. It is beyond all possibility of a doubt that the prisoner not only sold, but actually delivered packs of cards, and that it is proved beyond all possibility of a doubt or hesitation, that there were all these packs of cards not only sold, but a specific price to be given for each pack.

Court. I consider it as an offence undoubtedly upon which the Revenue has been defrauded in the strictest sense of the words of the Act of Parliament, that is on record, because there are fifty-one in one parcel, and one in another, which made up the pack of cards.

Jury. Q.(To the Secretary of the Stamp Office.) Whether you know of any cards being sold to the Neckinger Mill Company? - A. There were some sold, but I do not know to whom.

Court. Q.(To Mr. Solicitor of the Stamp Office.) Do you know of any being sold to the Neckinger Mill Company? - A. A society of gentlemen proposed to convert old paper into new, they applied to Government for authority to purchase the waste paper at the Stamp Office, and Government conceiving it was for the benefit of the public, the Commissioners were directed to sell their waste paper for the purpose of being converted into new paper, consequently the Commissioners did dispose of a great quantity of waste paper, amongst which there were cancelled aces of spades, which were brought from the card-makers, with the corners cut off; the Company, at the same time, giving this most positive assurance, that the paper would be immediately plunged into the caldron, and at once destroyed; this Company and manufactory failed, they did not perform their engagement by destroying this waste paper, they afterwards advertised their stock to be sold, and amongst the other things the aces of spades were sold cancelled, and with the corners cut off.

Court. Q. Do you know, of your own knowledge, that all the aces of spades that they sold the corners were cut off? - A. Mr. Lee applied with a feigned name, they were not sold in sheets, I cannot speak to that.

Prisoner. Mr. Robey, the auctioneer, sold these goods for the Neckinger Mill Company; I gave my attorney yesterday evening some aces of spades which Mr. Lee had purchased of the Neckinger Mill Company, he purchased vast quantities, and my attorney has some of the aces without the corners being cut off; I have been informed that they sold a vast quantity which originally came from Somerset-house.

Court. Gentlemen, you are to understand that they waited for the aces of spades while they were engraving the plate, therefore this could not be from that.

The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.

GUILTY , Death , aged 28.

First Middlesex Jury, before Mr. Baron Thompson .

John Blacklin, who was convictcd in the former part of the Session, for uttering forged stamps cards, was yesterday placed at the bar, an arrest of judgment having been suggested on his trial by Mr. Sergeant Best, in an objection to the form of the indictment. Mr. Gleed supported the plea in favour of the prisoner, and his arguments were replied to by Messrs. Fielding, Dampier, and Knapp, Counsel for the Crown. The Recorder, however, not feeling it his duty to decide the point, arrested judgment until the matter should be decided by the Twelve Judges.

Blacklin it seems, got off lightly. I found no record of his execution, and we might assume he received a lesser sentence.

As well as the fraudsters, it seems that the smaller fry may also have been getting caught up by the policing operation, if the names recorded below are accurate (as yet, I haven't found them appear anywhere else). Or is this a garbled account, with the names and professions incorrectly recorded?

Morning Herald (London) - Tuesday 20 August 1805
SUICIDE.—An elderly Lady, near 70 years of age, put a period to her existence on Wednefday evening last, near Weybridge, in Surrey. She was the wife of Mr. JOHN SKELTON, Tea-dealer, in Green-street, Grosvenor-square, and had been for some time desponding in her mind; in consequence of which, she had been at various places for the recovery of her health, and had latterly been on a visit to the family of Mr. BENNETT, near Weybridge. On Tuesday morning, after partaking of a hearty breakfafi, she observed to the family, that she would take a short walk, being of opinion it would do her good, and with unusual earnestness bid them " Good bye," but returned shortly, and, tbaking them by the hands, said, " God bids you! God bids you!" Expecting her return, the family waited with the utmost anxiety for the space of two hours ; but not returning, they sent messengers after her. After a considerable search, she was found on the following morning sitting upright in a ditch, with her throat cut from ear to ear, and a pen-knife lying by her side, which she generally carried in her pocket. A Coroner's Inquest was summoned, and the evidence adduced proved these facts, with the addition, that the whole of the day on which the disappeared was spent in a hay-field, where some haymakers were at work, who observed her walking backwards and forwards. The Jury refurned a verdict of *Lunacy*.—The unhappy Lady was very much repsected, for the urbanity and gentleness with which on all occasions she conducted herself, and was the mother of a fine family of children, all of whom are arrived at puberty.

Morning Post - Monday 23 September 1805
OLD BAILEY. — Saturday, Sept. 21. *Richard Harding* was indicted on two counts ; the first charging him with forging, fabricating, and publishing, as true, a stamp on the spade ace ; and second, with selling and uttering the same playing cards, well knowing such stamp to be forged. The case was opened at great length by the Attorney-General.

Mr. Hockley, the printer of the legal spade ace stamps, stated that he had purchased of the prisoner's apprentice, and of him-self, various packs of cards, the aces of spades in each pack being spurious. These purchases were very frequent, and took place in the month of June, 1804. It appeared that the prisoner kept two shops, one in Hereford-street, Oxofrd-street, and the other in North-row, Grosvenor-square, where he sold cards. It was also proved that the prisoner occupied, privately, premises behind the house of Mr. Skelton, Green-street, Grosvenor-square. A body of evidence was then adduced, in order to shew that the prisoner had employed a stone seal engraver, of the name of Leadbeater, to execute aces of spades for him. Having prevailed on Leadbeater to learn the art of engraving on copper, the expence of which he was to pay. Mr. Woodthorpe, a respectable engraver, in Fetter-lane, was applied to, and he took Leadbeater under his tuition. The prisoner frequently called on him, and one day he shewed him an old plate of the spade ace, wnich he wished to be touched up. Leadbeater was unable to do the job, winch was delivered to Bunning, an apprentice, who was to put the name of Blanchard on the plate. Bunning was imposed on, for he was told that the plate was for Mr. Shepherd, at the Stamp Office.

Rivett, Millar, and Carpmeal, searched the premises occupied by the prisoner, at the back of Skelton's house, where they found a quantity of counterfeit stamp aces, and a quantity of plates tor fabricating stamps, which were concealed under ground. In the counterfeit aces, in the word *Dieu*, in the motto, in the letter R. was substituted for the letter F.

Mr. Justice Heath addressed the Jury, and observed there could be no doubt in the case. The Jury found the prisoner guilty— *Death*.

Hampshire Chronicle - Monday 30 September 1805
Old Bailey, Sept. 21.
Richard Harding was capitally indicted for forging and counterfeiting certain stamps, or Stamp-office marks, the ace of spades, on playing cards, and vending and uttering the same, knowing them to be forged and counterfeited, contrary to the statute of the 44th of the King.

This was trial of considerable interest, carried on at the prosecution of the Commissioners of Stamp Duties. The prisoner was card-maker, in a most eminent and respectable line of trade, and carried on his business at two different houses, licensed for the purpose, viz. Hereford-Street, Oxford-road, and Green-street, Grosvenor-square. The suspicions against the prisoner were excited in the Commissioners by the very small number of stamps he took out in proportion to the extensive line of business he carried on; consequence of which they employed persons to purchase different quantities of cards at his house, from the examination of which the forgeries were detected.

The prosecution was opened by Mr. Dampier, and the case stated by the Attorney-General; Mr. Garrow and Mr. Knapp were also for the prosecution, and Mr. Alley and Mr. Gurney for the prisoner.

The evidence adduced was nearly of the same nature with that brought forward against the persons who were some Sessions ago convicted of a similar offence. It was proved that the prisoner had the plates in his possession for stamping the card, and that he had been seen working upon them.

The prisoner adduced evidence to disprove any one of the charges, but a number of most respectable tradesmen from his own neighbourhood, who knew him for a series of years, gave him most excellent character.

The Jury, after a short consultation, found a verdict of *Guilty*——DEATH.

OLD BAILEY. Saturday 18 were tried at the Old Bailey, five whom were capitally convicted, viz. R. Harding, for counterfeiting the Ace of Spades, with intent to defraud the revenue. Our Readers must recollect that several persons hare already been tried for Vending playing cards, with forged duty aces, knowing them to be fraudulent and fabricated, and that one Blacklin is now under sentence of death for the same. It appeared in the course of the evidence in this case, that the prisoner, who was some time back a card-maker near Oxford-street, had procured several men to engrave the plates, and to embark in the unlawful practice, by the most deceitful representations, and through their means he had carried on a traffic to a degree exceeding all calculation. He procured and worked off the duty aces, which he sold to other dealers at a rate comparatively nothing with the Government duty, and yet he must have amassed great sums of money.

Bell's Weekly Messenger - Sunday 22 September 1805
On Friday 18 prisoners were tried, one of whom was capitally convicted. ...
Yesterday Richard Harding was capitally indicted for forging, fabricating, uttering, and publishing as true, a stamp the spade ace, with intent to defraud the revenue.

The Attorney General opened the case on the part of the prosecution, in a very long speech, in which he stated to the Jury the outline of the prisoner’s transactions. The first witness called was Mr. Hockley, the printer of the legal spade ace at the Stamp-Office. He had very frequently made purchases of packs of cards of the prisoner, as had also his apprentice, and the stamps on the aces of spades were all forges. These purchases, which were very numerous, took place in the month of June 1804. It appeared by the evidence adduced on the part of the prosecution, that the prisoner kept two shops, where these packs of cards were sold, the one in Hereford-street, Oxford-street, and the other in North-row, near Grosvenor-square. The prisoner’s apprentice deposed, that he saw his master making cards on one occasion, and observed him to paste labels on them, which he gave a gloss to by putting some liquid on them. Witness also proved that the prisoner occupied premises behind the house of Mr. Skelton, Green-street, Grosvenor square. A body of evidence was adduced to prove that the prisoner had employed a seal engraver of the name of Leadbeater to execute aces of spades for him. Leadbeater dined with the prisoner two years since, when he asked him if he could engrave on copper. On being answered the negative, the prisoner requested he would find some trusty artist in that branch. Leadbeater recommended a youth of the name of White, who, the prisoner was informed, could be depended on. Four duty aces were given to Leadbeater for White to imitate as closely possible, and if he was asked any questions, was to say they were for a foreigner at Hamburg. White, however, was timid, and all negociations With him was abandoned. In six or seven months after, the prisoner pressed on Leadbeater to learn the art of engraving copper, adding, that he would be at the expence of a master. Mr. Woodthorpe, a respectable engraver in Fetter-lane, waa applied to, and the witness was placed under his tuition. The prisoner's visits to Leadbeater was very frequent, and one day he showed him an old plate of the spade ace, which he wished to be touched up. Witness was unable to do the job, and an apprentice of the name of Bunning was employed, under the impression that the plate was for Mr. Shepherd of the Stamp Office. It was also proved, in evidence, that the prisoner had large dealings with Mr. Skelton for spirits, &c. for which he gave *waste paper*; that is, packs of cards, which Mr. S. sold st a profit. Rivctt, Miliar, and Carpmeal, searched the premises occupied by the prisoner, at tbe back of Mr. Skelton's house. They found a quantity of forged stamps of the spade ace, and also a quantity of forged plates for frabricating the stamps, which were concealed under ground. In the counterfeit aces, in the word"Dieu*", in the motto the letter R. was substituted for the letter E. Mr, Justice Heath addressed the Jury, and observed, there could doubt in the case. The Jury found the prisoner *Guilty*, *Death*. The prisoner is a genteel man, 35 years of age, and he was dressed in black, and full powdered!

General Evening Post - Tuesday 24 September 1805

Old Bailey, Saturday, Sept. 21

Richard Harding was capitally indicted for forging and counterfeiting certain stamps, or Stamp Office marks, of the Ace of Spades, on playing cards, and vending and uttering the same knowng them to be forged and counterfeited, contrary to the statute of the 44th of the King.

This was a trial of considerable interest, carried on at the prosecution of the Commissioners of Stamp Duties. The prisoner was a cardmaker, in a most eminent and respectable line of trade, and carried on his busienss at two different houses, licensed for the purpose, viz. in Hereford-street, Oxford-road, and in Green0street, Grosvenor-square. The suspicions against the prisoner were excited in the Commissioners by the very small number of stamps he took out, in proportion to the extensive line of business he carried on; in consequence of which they employed persons to purchase different quantities of cards at his hiouse, from the examination of which the forgeries were detected.

The prosecution was opened by Mr, Dampier, and the case stated by the Attorney General; Mr. Garrow and Mr. Knapp qwere also for the prosecution; and Mr. Alley and Mr. Gurney for the prisoner.

John Hockey, an officer in the Stamp Office, whose peculiar business is to print the Ace of Spades for the card-dury department, deposed that he was sent, on the 14th of May last, by order of the Commissioners of Stamps, to purchase some cards of the prisoner, at his house, in Hereford-street. The prisoner was not at home, but he purchased six packs of a lad, hois servant, named Lepine. On the 16th, he went again, and bought six packs of the prisoner himself, and paid him 21s; he went again on the 24th, and puchased twleve packs, paying 41s.; he went again, on a subsequent day, and order five dozen to be sent to his house, No. 74, Edgeware-road, which were accordingly set, with a receipt for the purchase money; witness was not at home when they were brought. The several parcels were produced, and the witness identified them as purchased and marked by him at the time. Said, he had been thirteen years in his present department at the tamp Office, was well acquainted with the marks there were always impressed on the Ace of Spades; and said, he immediately knew those Aces on the cards he purchased at the prisoner's to be forged, as one in particular had an error in the first word of the motto of the Royal Arms, being spelled *Dier* instead of *Dieu*.

Stephen Lepine deposed, that he was apprenticed with the prisoner 2 years, ending the 8th instant. He has seen the prisoner engaged in making cards and pasting wrappers, and when the cards were made up, witness has frequently seen the prisoner take something out of a bottle, and put it on the stamp of the wrapper, for the purpose, as he thought, of giving it a gloss. He has seen copper plates in the possession of the prisoner, and he remembers having delivered cards, in his master's shop, to Mr. Hockey. He knew nothing more of the plates than having seen then in his possession. He knew a person named Leadbeater, whom he has seen with the prisoner, and who used to bring him plates for cards and bills of parcels. The prisoner carried on his business only in North-row, and Hereford-street, and no where else as the witness knew.

A witness, named Leadbeater, deposed, that he lodges at No. 65, Well-stree, Oxford-road, and is a stone seal engraver. has known the prisoner three years; remembers having dined with the prisoner at his house on a Sunday about two years since; after dinner the prisoner called him aside in another room, shut the door, and asked him if he could engrave on copper; witness said no, but he knew a young man who did, named White. The prisoner paused some time, and then asked if he could be depended upon? Witness answered *he* would endeavour to get done for him anything he wanted. Prisoner said he would call on him in a few days, which he did at the witness's lodgings, in Greek-street, and brought with hime four copies of the *Duty Ace of Spades*, with the name of the seller cut off, and told him to take them to White and get them copied as close as he could, and if White should ask any questions, to say they were for a foreginer at Hamburgh. Witness carried them to White, and asked him if he would copy them; White said he would call and let him know next day: when he did see him, and White said, for God's sake Leadbeater take care what you are about; adding, that he could engrave them, but he must give them into the hands of a Magistrate.— Witness then said, it was a cardmaker of his acquaintance that gave them to him, and afterwards went and told the prisoner what passed, and that White said it was a forgery. The prisoner answered it was no such thing, and desired witness to call on White again and tell him to do them, and any money he might ask he should have : but White said he would have nothing to do with them, but thought the witness knew who they were for. Saw White no more; nothing farther passed for six or seven months ; witness afterwards lodged at 42, Great Titchfield-street, whither the prisoner came to him and asked him if he thought he could do the cards himself; witness said NO, but that he thought he might soon learn with instructions; prisoner desired him to look out for and agree with some proper person to instruct him, and he would pay the expence ; and witness accordingly applied to Mr. Woodthorpe, an engraver in Fetter-lane, who agreed, for twenty guineas to instruct him. The prisoner frequently asked him, while under Mr. Woodthorpe's instruction, how he came on ; and at one time asked him if he could not copy the Ace of Spades, as he was much distressed since the poor old *Baronet*, who used to do them for him the last sixteen years was dead. He afterwards brought the witness copper plate with 24 Aces of Spades and asked him if he could *touch it up* (a term used by the engravers for repairing a plate). Witness said he would try, and on the Sunday following went to dine with the prisoner, who after dinner brought him into a room with the plate, and locked the dour. Witness tried to touch it up, but could not. The prisoner came to him in a quarter of an hour. Witness remembers the numbers this plate were 1, 2, 6, 7. Prisoner came again to his lodgings, and asked him if he could engrave on brass, which he answered in the negative ; he brought a plate with him under his coat, with twenty Aces of Spades upon it, and told the witness to copy 14, 15, 19, 20,  which witness said he would, and employed a young man named Bunning, an apprentice to Mr Woodthorpe, to do it ; gave the plate afterwards to the prisoner, who said it was very neatly done, and came shortly afterwards to have another done, but instead of the name of Harding, to put in that of Blanchard, and gave him an Exportation Ace to copy from; this done he came again, and ordered two more with the name Harding, and the duty on, observing, that if he worked too much on one plate, he should be found out. Witness remembers at the time when Harding and Lee were taken taken. The officers had been to his house, and the prisoner gave him instructions, if he was asked any questions, to say he knew nothing about the business. Witness was apprehended in June, and at that time there were two of the prisoner's plates in his house, which the prisoner had brought to have some more printed.

*Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney.* Witnes said, he had told Bunning, who engraved those plates, that they were for Mr. Shepherd, Engraver to the Stamp Office: that he himself was taken up three times after his first examination, that he was a little afraid for his neck; acknowledged that the first and second accounts he gave to the Magistrates of the transaction were very different, and neither true, but said that he would abide by the last account he had given, as that was the truth. The others he acknowledged to be false, though all taken before the same Magistrate.

Christopher Bunning supported the testimony of the last witness, so far as concerned him.

Mr. Skelton a grocer, in Green-street, Grosvenour-square, deposed, that the prisoner was originally his shopman; about two years since he took from him a warehouse in his back-yard, of which the prisoner generally kept the key, but sometimes lieft it at his house. He had a copper-plate press in this room, and occupied it in printing Aces of Spades, at which the witness never saw him particularly employed but once, so as to see what he was printing. The prisoner himself frequently came there, sometimes twice a day, and often not for days together : he had frequently seen him at work there, with an apron before him, and flannel jacket on. He dealt with the witness for spirits and groceries, and used to give him other commodities in exchange, called *waste paper*; the commodity so called was playing cards, in perfect packs, made up in white paper, not sealed, charged to the witness 17s. 6d. per dozen packs, and sold again by him at a profit. He sometimes had four, five, or six dozen at a time. This traffic continued for some time before the prisoner had taken the witness's back-premises. It was not the witness who kept the account current, but his wife, who died some time since—(here the witness burst into tears. His late wife was the unfortunate person who some weeks since put an end to her existence at a village some distance from town, under the tortures of mind she experienced on the subject of this business). His house was searched at the time the prisoner was taken, and an acconnt current between them in the handwriting of the prisoner, found there, which the prisoner the day before had brought and given him, and desired him to take care of it, but did not then explain his reasons. The officers searched also the back-house, and found the flannel jacket and other articles, all the prisoner's property. The prisoner also brought him a large roll of papers in blue wrapper, and desired him to put it safe out of the way, and the witness took it to the lodging of his daughter, and placed it in her custody; she did not know what it contained. The officers came there a second time and found some copper plates, by digging in garden, near the privy ; they were placed there, as he supposes, by the prisoner, as he had told them they were. He acknowledged the officers dug for them his direction.

Edward Stone, a servant of the prisoner, said it was part of his business to cut aces of spades to perfect packs, once a month : they were twenty on a sheet ; he never saw any there with less. He fewer within the last six months befere the prisoner was apprehended than in the six months preceding.

John Rivett, a Bow Street Officer, deposed, that he went with Carpmeal and Miller, on the 25th June, to Hereford-street, and apprehended the prisoner, his apprentice, and another servant of his. Nothing particular was found there; went to Leadbeater's, and there found two copperplates of the ace of spades, and some paper, on the top of a rolling press. Went also to Skelton's, and there found, in the room behind the yard, an iron fly press, two rowllers of a rolling-press, a flannel jacket, a. red-ink ball, and a marble slab; on searching the dust hole below, they found the remainder of the rolling-press, and the plates hid under ground in the garden ; in the back room there were three gross of packs of cads made up, but without the aces of spades. On the 9th of July they went again to Leadbeater's, and found the plates, with aces of spades in the privy. In the house of Mr. Shingler they found, in a box with foul linen, a roll of papers containing impressions of the ace of spades.

An Officer of the Stamp Office proved that this parcel contained 3000 impressions of the ace of spades.

The Distributor of Stamps proved that the ace of spaces he delivers out to the card-makers are always twenty on a sheet ; and consequently no aces not so printed have been printed at the Stamp Office.

Here closed the evidence for the prosecution ; the prisoner adduced no evidence to disprove any one of the charges, but a number of most respectable tradesmen from his own neighbourhood, who knew him for a series of years gave him a most excellent character.

The Jury, after a short consultation, found a verdict *Guilty*, *Death*. —Aged 35.

RICHARD HARDING, Deception ; forgery, 18th September 1805.

583. RICHARD HARDING was indicted for that he, on the 24th of May , feloniously did forge, counterfeit, and resemble, on the spotted side on one of the cards in a certain parcel of playing cards, the impression of a certain mark used and denoted on the spotted side of playing cards, with intention to defraud the duty charged on playing cards .

Second Count. For feloniously vending and selling, on the same day, certain playing cards, with counterfeit impressions of certain marks used and denoted upon playing cards, he at the time knowing the said marks to be counterfeited. And

Thirteen other Counts for like offence, only charging them in a different manner.

(The indictment was read by Mr. Dampier.)

Mr. Attorney General. - Gentlemen, This prosecution, we all understand, is against the prisoner for an offence which he has committed against the stamp laws, and the indictment charges him with having counterfeited the impression of stamps authorised by the Commissioners for the purpose of denoting the duty on playing cards; it charges him likewise of vending and selling cards with these counterfeited impressions, knowing it to be so done.

Gentlemen, The act under which the prisoner is prosecuted makes it a capital offence for either counterfeiting, vending, or selling cards with counterfeited stamps, the person so acting having a guilty knowledge thereof.

Gentlemen, Having stated these circumstances to you, I conceive I must do more, in order to apprise you of the serious and important business in which we are now engaged. The prisoner at the bar is a licensed card-maker, having two licensed shops, the one situated in Hereford-street, Oxford-street, and the other in North-row, Grosvenor-square; I shall shew you that in these two places he carried on the manufacturing and selling of playing cards. There was another place the prisoner had, which was even unknown even to the servants that were employed in either of these manufactories, in which almost all the infamous part was transacted by the prisoner himself alone.

Gentlemen, The extensive manner in which he carried on this business, compared with the small demand he made at the Stamp office for stamps to have legally carried it on, was one of the first circumstances that appeared against the prisoner, and that a fraudulent fabrication were made and vended, to a large extent, in lieu of the legal one, there was not the least doubt. And in consequence of this, and likewise from some other circumstances, it came sufficiently to the knowledge of the persons employed at the Stamp-office that there must be some illegal practice carried on. It was thought expedient to employ one Hockey, who is the printer of the legal ace of spades at the Stamp-office, in order to see if they could detect him in the improper practice he was carrying on, and this employment of Mr. Hockey has led to the discovery for which the prisoner is now brought here. It was in the month of May, I think the 14th, that Mr. Hockey made the first purchase; he called at his house, and asked for six packs of playing cards, Mr. Harding was not at home, but a servant furnished him with the six packs of playing cards; the charge that was made for them was about a guinea, nothing at all under what would be the trade price bought at a regular manufactory; Mr. Hockey having purchased these six packs of cards, he found that they contained all the marks and impressions of forged stamps, and he was satisfied in his own mind that they were undoubtedly forged. He was not contented with making this purchase, he went on the 16th, and purchased six packs more; Mr. Harding then was at home, and served him himself. On the 21st he made another purchase, when the same servant furnished him with six packs more, and on the 24th of May he purchased a dozen packs; the cards in this dozen were furnished him by the prisoner himself. On the 27th, he went again to the shop, and ordered five dozen to be sent to No. 74, Edgware-road; these cards were sent accordingly, and the person that carried them will be called; he will tell you (he was in the habit of giving receipts not in his master's name;) he asked his master in what name he should give the receipt, his master told him to give the receipt in any name he pleased; he was instructed where to carry them, and he gave the receipt in the name of Bates. When he returned he told his master, and his master was very well satisfied with it.

Gentlemen, This circumstance was in order to prevent the easy communication of tracing back these packs of cards; for all these and every one of those different packs of cards which were purchased on those specific days, in the month of May, contained the forged impressions of these counterfeited stamps, and the prosecution against the prisoner was supposed to be complete by these various instances of selling these counterfeited impressions. In consequence of that, it was thought fit to apprehend him, and to make a seizure from which informationmight be collected from the circumstances of the manner in which it was carried on. He was apprehended, and several of his servants were likewise laid hold of at the time; and from this remarkable circumstance it is evident that the prisoner must have become acquainted previously, that there was that suspicion ripened against him, that it was likely that he should be the subject of apprehension; for upon the seizure of the stock there was not one single forged impression found, although down to the twenty-fourth of May he had, wherever the sale had been made, sold cards with these counterfeited impressions; they were all removed before the apprehension and seizure; that unquestionably by some means or other the prisoner must have been apprised thereof. After the apprehension of the prisoner, the persons that assisted him in carrying on this nefarious business, who were taken at the same time, became the subjects of examination, and the connection and acquaintance of the prisoner were discovered; and that a person of the name of Leadbetter was the engraver that was employed by the prisoner, and a person of the name of Skelton was one that had considerable dealings with him; that they were frequently employed in carrying cards to Mr. Skelton, who lived somewhere near Grosvenor-square. I shall shew to you the manner in which the prisoner at the bar first seduced Leadbetter, and the manner in which Leadbetter seduced Bunning - I can hardly say seduced, employed Bunning. That the prisoner at the bar actually paid for Leadbetter's instruction in the art of engraving on copper-plates, he being a stone seal-engraver; and after the prisoner had actually paid for the instruction of Leadbetter, he was anxious to know whether he could execute a plate for him. Leadbetter attempted not only to touch up a plate, but also to engrave others for him; but in consequence of his not being able to do it for him, he was desirous of getting it done for him; he employed a man of the name of Bunning, who was himself an engraver in this line. Leadbetter led him to believe that he was acquainted with a drunken engraver who worked for the Stamp-office, who would lose his business if he did not get some able hand to do them for him. These are the outlines of the case, in which, if the facts are brought home to him, I am sure you will not entertain a doubt of the propriety of the prosecution against the prisoner, Mr. Harding.

Gentlemen, I shall first state to you what it is we have to prove against him; I shall then state what is necessary to prove against the prisoner by the detail already applied to the facts. The first thing to be proved against him is vending these articles, knowing them to be counterfeited - for vending these packs of cards with the counterfeited impressions of the stamps, he knowing them to be counterfeited, rather than the actual counterfeiting of the impressions of that stamp. I shall shew to you that at the early stage of the business evident proof of his having vended these articles in considerable quantities to a person of the name of Hockey, and that Hockey will shew to you, beyond all possibility of a doubt, that he sold these cards with the counterfeited impressions on them; and to establish that fact, that he knew they were counterfeited, I shall here state the manner in which the duty stamps are carried on at the Stamp-office. This will of itself make it next to impossibility that any trader carrying on the business as this man did, could possibly sell or vend cards without knowing they were false. The duty on playing cards is upon the whole two shillings and sixpence; there is a duty of sixpence on the wrapper; and with respect to the ace of spades particularly, the Office makes a plate for every dealer, and upon that plate for every dealer they put the dealer's name. Every dealer, therefore, must know, that in order to get a legal ace of spades, he must have the ace of spades that is furnished by the Stamp-office themselves; he cannot get it from any other quarter. If any dealer is furnished with any other ace of spades, he must know that they were forged; for on looking upon the legal impression of the duty ace, there is charged sixpence upon the top, and sixpence on each side, and then there is the name of Harding, or of the dealer, that is, the card-maker, at the bottom; and any card-maker getting it from any other quarter, must know that he has got a false impression.

Gentlemen, This case will by no means rest here; but I shall shew to you the actual employment of the prisoner, and who it was that made the fabricated plate. I shall shew you by one of his servants that he had a plate in his possession of the ace of spades, and that he saw him polish the impression that is made on the label fabricated stamp, to give it that gloss which the legal stamp does, in order to meet the eye, and to be less liable of detection. You will find from his servants that, for several weeks before the time that he was apprehended, he had taken upon himself entirely the whole management of that part of the business which consisted of making the aces of spades. The legal aces of spades have twenty impressions upon a sheet of paper of a large size at the Stamp-office; they are cut in shape, and put on one side of the cards by the card-maker; they are progressively numbered from one to twenty. The plate that the prisoner procured to be fabricated, only contained four of these impressions, and when you come to examine the particulars of the plate, you will find that some of them are not correct with the original of which they were intended; for I think they have got an R instead of the E in the word Dieu. In this instance it points out, beyond all possibility of a doubt, that it is a forgery.

Gentlemen, You will find that he kept this part of the business to himself for six months before he was apprehended; that he cut these out, and pasted them on the cards; that he delivered the aces of spades, which were to be included in these packs, himself; and I apprehend from this circumstance of Leadbetter being actually employed and engaged by the prisoner to acquire that knowledge by which he was to fabricate the legal stamps, will make it beyond all doubt that he knew they were forged. I have pointed out these other circumstances, independent of the proof of Leadbetter, and particularly independent of the proof which will be given on the part of Skelton, because both Lead-better and Skelton will come before you as men who are more or less implicated in the guilt of the prisoner himself. With respect to Leadbetter, there is no doubt but he must know what these stamps were; and with respect to Skelton, there can be but little doubt, if any, but that he must have known the iniquitous purpose of these stamps. He will tell you that he knew theprisoner many years; that he let him part of his premises in a back yard behind his house, and that in these premises the prisoner carried on this nefarious business; he had often seen him, and often heard him make use of the instrument for forging these stamps. I say I will desire the keeping the case, as much as I can, without the assistance of these accomplices, because I think, without their assistance, there would be very near, if not quite, sufficient to prove the case against the prisoner. At Mr. Skelton's, and at the house of a person of the name of Shinglear, were found not less than two thousand aces that had been made by Harding, the prisoner, he having removed them from his premises the very night before his apprehension to elude every means of indicating the forged business being carried on by him.

Gentlemen, Some of the plates were found in the garden at Skelton's, and two were found in the possession of Leadbetter, to whom they had been returned by Harding, for the purpose of his secreting them. You will find that there is abundant proof against the prisoner at the bar, even if you were to put out the evidence of Skelton, or of Leadbetter, they being persons that were accomplices. You will be directed to give a very anxious attention to their evidence, and to be watchful whether their evidence is confirmed, and if it is confirmed, you may give the same reliance to that as to any other evidence. In this case you will give attention to the whole of it - how far the evidence supports the facts, and how far upon the whole these facts make out the case of guilt against the prisoner. In my mind it seems to be a case in which there will not be a possibility of a doubt, but it will be for you to determine.

JOHN HOCKEY sworn. - Examined by Mr. Garrow. Q. What are you? - A. I am printer of the ace of spades at the Stamp-office.

Q. Did you at any time, in consequence of any information, apply to the prisoner for the purpose of purchasing cards? - A. Yes, on the 14th of May.

Q. Where did you apply for them? - A. In Hereford-street, Oxford-street.

Q.Looking at that accurately, do you believe that to be printed from the legal Stamp Office press? - A. I do not believe it to be printed from the Stamp Office press, because it has a wrong letter, there is an R instead of an E, in the motto, in number one.

Q. Do you remember at one time dining with him on Sunday? - A. Yes.

Court. Q. How long ago was that? - A. Near two years; I cannot exactly say.

Mr. Dampier. Q. After dinner did any thing pass between you? - A. Some little time after dinner he called me on one side and said, I shall be glad to speak to you; and after that I went up stairs with him, and he said, Leadbetter, can you, or do you engrave on copper: I said, no, I could not, it was quite out of my profession; I replied that I knew a young man of the name of White, who was an engraver in that line, and I supposed he would do what he wanted to get done; Mr. Harding paused a little time, and he returned back and said, White you have mentioned, do you think this White can be depended on; or can I, or may I depend on you: To that reply I told him, I would do my endeavour to get what he might want done.

Q. Did he tell you what? - A. No; I told him I had known White from a lad, even from an apprentice.

Q. What Did Mr. Harding say upon that? - A. He said he would call upon me in the course of the next week; then he went away.

Q. How soon afterwards was it that you saw Mr. Harding? - A. About three weeks.

Q. Where was that? - A. He came to my lodgings, which were, at that time, No. 3, Greek-street.

Q. Had he any thing with him when he came? - A. He brought with him four duty aces of spades with the name of Harding cut off.

Q. You can only tell a name was cut off; what did he say to you? - A. He told me to take that to Mr. White and tell him to copy it as close as he could, and if he should ask any questions, to tell him it was for a foreigner at Hambro'; he then went away.

Q. Did you carry these to White? - A. Yes, I did.

Q. Did any conversation pass between you and White? - A. Yes.

Q. Did you tell him what passed between you and White? - A. Yes, I had some difficulty to find him; I met him in Long-acre, and he took me into some shops; I asked him to call at my lodgings, which he did; I asked him to engrave me a plate and to call on me to-morrow; when he came, he said, Leadbetter, for God's sake, do you know what you are doing of? I told him I did not; he then said, he could engrave these aces, but if he did, he must give them into the hands of a Magistrate, for he had asked a question of his friend, who was a card-maker, and he told him that.

Q. How soon afterwards did you see Harding? - A. The next day he came to me.

Q. Now then at that time did you inform Harding of what you have told us, of what White said to you? - A. Yes.

Q. What did Harding say to that? - A. He still persisted it was no such thing; I told him that White told me it was a forgery; he insisted it was no such thing, he said he was a poor fool, and knew no better.

Q. What further did he say? - A. He told me to go to White again, and to tell him that no harm should come to him if he would do it, and more than that, whatever money he wanted or asked he should have, and that he should have the money first.

Q. Did you see White afterwards, to inform him of that? - A. I did.

Q. Would White do them? - A. He told me that he would have nothing to do in it, for he thought that I knew who they were for.

Q. After that, I believe, you never saw White? - A. No.

Q. Did you see Harding soon afterwards? - A. Yes.

Q. Did he come to you, or did you go to him? - A. I think I went and told him what White had said.

Q. What did he say to that? - A. There was nothing more passed after that; he never took any more notice about engraving for six or seven months.

Q. I think you lodged, then, in Greek-street? - A. Yes.

Q. After that you lodged in Titchfield-street, No. 42? - A. Yes.

Q. Did you there see Mr. Harding? - A. Yes, about six or seven months after the time I was speaking of, he came to my lodgings in Titchfield-street, he asked me and said, do you think in your own mind, you could learn to engrave on copper: I then told him I did not know, but I thought I might; upon which he said, if you will get some one to instruct you, I will pay for your instruction: upon which I applied to several people, and I was recommended to Mr. Woodthorpe, in Fetter-lane, to whom I went; he told me to call again on the next day, when I went to him, and he would give me an answer; he did afterwards do it.

Q. Did he undertake to instruct you afterwards? - A. He did.

Q. For what sum was he to instruct you? - A. For twenty pounds or guineas, I think guineas.

Q. Who paid that money? - A. Mr. Harding, he furnished me with that money to pay Mr. Woodthorpe.

Q. After you had been with Mr. Woodthorpe a competent time, did he come to you to see how you improved? - A. He asked me if I had practised enough to touch up a plate for him; I then asked him what that plate was; he told me it was a plate of the aces of spades; and he said that the poor old man - the poor old Baronet that did it for him was dead.

Q. Did you endeavour to do it? - A. I told him I could not.

Q. After that did he come to you again? - A. Yes.

Q. How long afterwards was it, a week or a month? - A. It might be a month.

Q. Did he come to you again? - A. He came to me again, and asked me how I came on with Woodthorpe; I told him very well.

Q. Did he then shew you any thing? - A. Yes.

Q. What was it? - A. He came and shewed me a plate of four duty aces of spades.

Q. What did he say he wanted to be done with it? - A. He said he wanted it to be touched up;and then we walked to the other end of the room, and said, had I better touch it up here, or come to his house to do it; I told him to do as he pleased; he then said, come to my house; I went and dined there, it was on a Sunday, and after dinner he shut me into a room, and gave me some gravers, and told me to do the best I could with them.

Q. How did he shut you in the room? - A. He locked the door; I tried to do it, but finding I could not do it, I left off; he came into the room about the dusk of the evening, he said, Leadbetter, what have you done? I told him I had done a little, I did not know whether it would do or no; with that he said, never mind it now, I will try to do it myself.

Q. Do you recollect at all what the number were? - A. To the best of my knowledge it was one, two, six, and seven.

Q. Did you see him afterwards? - A. Yes.

Q. Was it at your lodgings that he came again? - A. Yes, he came to my lodgings.

Q. Did he ask you any further questions? - A. He said, he did not mind telling me what he wanted.

Q. What did he want? - A. He asked me if I could engrave on brass with my own machine; I told him, I could not.

Mr. Dampier. The witness is a stone engraver.

Q. He asked you if you could engrave on brass? - A. I told him I could not, my tools were made of the softest iron I could get.

Q. Did he afterwards ask you of your progress with Mr. Woodthorpe? - A. He came again, and asked me how I came on with Mr. Woodthorpe; I told him as before, very well. He brought me a plate under his coat, and gave me a sheet of aces of spades.

Q. Containing the number of twenty? - A. Yes.

Q. Such a one as this? - A. Yes.

Q. What did he say to you? - A. He told me that he would be glad if I would copy fourteen, fifteen, nineteen, and twenty, and do them as close as possible I could, he was so distressed he did not know what to do; I then told him I would. Finding I was not capable of doing it, I employed a man of the name of Bunning.

Q. Did you communicate to Harding that you had employed Bunning? - A. No, I did not.

Q. Did you give Bunning the plate, and did Bunning do the plate? - A. He did.

Q. Did you give the plate so done by Bunning to Harding? - A. I did.

Q. When you gave it to him, what did he say to it? - A. He said it was not a proper thing to be done; Bunning said that.

Q. Now, when you gave the plate to Harding which Bunning had worked upon, did Harding make any observation upon it? - A. He looked at it, and said it was very neatly done.

Q. What did he do upon that - did he give you any other plate? - A. He came a very short time afterwards, and told me that he liked that plate very well that I had done, and he would be obliged to me to do another, and put the name of Blanchard in; he gave me an exportation ace, a sheet of the same size as one of them; I gave it to Bunning with his directions, and got it done.

Q. Did you give that to Harding? - A. I did.

Q. Some time after that did he come to you again? - A. Yes.

Q. What did he say to you? - A. He asked me if I had done the plates; I told him, yes; he said he would be obliged to me if I would do one or two more, with the name of Harding, duty aces not for exportation; I did two Blanchards, and then he came again for me to do a Harding, because he said he should be found out working on one number.

Q. Did you give that to Bunning? - A. I did.

Q. Was that done by Bunning? - A. Yes.

Q. And afterwards given by you to Harding? - A. Yes.

Q. Did you ever see him again with one of the Blanchard plates? - A. Yes, he came to me again to see if I would take out the palm-branch; the exportation aces are with palm-branches, and the duty aces are with leaves on them; I was to take out the palm-branch, and to put in the leaves; I was to make some alteration that they should not be exactly to pattern; it was taken out, but the alteration was not made, I had not time.

Q. Do you remember the bustle there was about Lee and Hardy? - A. Yes.

Q. About that time Blacklin was prosecuted, and Lee ran away? - A. Yes, he came to me, and said, for God sake, help me to bury the plates; for, said he, they have been searching my house; upon which I did.

Q. Did he give you any directions? - A. He told me to bury them; then he came again, and said, let me have them; he took the plates, and brought them again in the course of a day or two, and I buried them.

Q. Did he tell you what you were to do if you were asked about them? - A. Yes; he said if they came to me, and asked me any thing about it, to to say I knew nothing of any such thing.

Q. Do you remember the time you were apprehended? - A. I think it was the 25th of June.

Q. At that time were there any of these plates at your house? - A. Two.

Q. And you had employed a lad of the name of Bunning to forge others to engrave them? - A. Yes.

Q. Had you ever told that poor lad, Bunning, that they were done for the Commissioners of the Stamps? - A. Yes, I told him they were for Mr. Shephard, that belongs to the Stamp-office.

Q. How many times were you examined yourself after you were taken up? - A. Three times, to the best of my knowledge.

Q. With some little apprehension to your neck, you knew you were in danger? - A. Certainly; I had not a little apprehension, I knew I was in danger if I was not admitted an evidence for the crown.

Q. That is true - pray how many different accounts have you given before you had given this to-day? - A. To the best of my knowledge there was one.

Q. Were there not three? - A. I cannot exactly say there were not three.

Q. Do you not remember, at the conclusion of your last examination, your saying that the account you then gave you would stick by, and that your former accounts were not true? - A. I cannot understand you.

Q. Do not you remember being asked, upon the conclusion of the last account that you gave, whether the account of that day was true, or the account of former examinations - you said, the account I give to-day is true, and the former accounts are not; the former accounts were destroyed because they were false? - A. They were false in parts.

Q. And given before the same Magistrate? - A. Yes.

Q. He asked you whether you could engrave what he wanted? - A. Yes.

Q. Telling you what it was, what answer did you give him? - A. I told him I did not think I was capable, it was entirely out of my line.

Q. In order to induce you to do so, did not he tell you he would give you something, and teach you music also? - A. Yes.

Q. When you told him you must tell your master, he said you must not do that, because the Stamp-office will find it out - he told you that he had great influence at the Stamp-office, there was no harm in what you were doing of, and he could do any thing for you? - A. Yes.

Chester Courant - Tuesday 19 November 1805
EXECUTION
John Harding, for forging the stamp upon the Ace of Spades William Cubitt, groom of the chambers to the Earl of Mansfield, for robbing his master of a gold box, set with diamonds, a portrait of the late Emperor Russia, a present from that Monarch to the late Earl; and Mary Parnell, for forgery upon the Bank of England, were executed this morning, at half-past eight o'clock, at the usual place, in the front of the Old Bailey. Mr. Harding was dressed in black, the woman all in white, white gloves, &c. she was conduced to the scaffold by Mr. Ford, the Ordinary. After Mr. Ford had delivered his pious exhortation to these three unhappy persons, the platform fell, and Mr. Ford, who happened to be standing upon it the time, came to the ground. We are concerned to state, that he was much bruised. He was assisted into Mr. Newman's house immediately. The woman struggled much before she died. Cubitt appeared almost insensible, from the moment he was brought out to the scaffold. The concourse of people that attended the execution was immense. The Sheriffs and City Marshals, Nalder and Holdsworth, were present upon the occasion.— John Burrows, a youth of 17, who was also under sentence of death, has been respited tor 14 days. His unhappy parents left town yesterday, overwhelmed with grief, considering his fate inevitable.
