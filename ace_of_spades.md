EXECUTION
John Harding, for forging the stamp upon the Ace of Spades William Cubitt, groom of the chambers to the Earl of Mansfield, for robbing his master of a gold box, set with diamonds, a portrait of the late Emperor Russia, a present from that Monarch to the late Earl; and Mary Parnell, for forgery upon the Bank of England, were executed this morning, at half-past eight o'clock, at the usual place, in the front of the Old Bailey. Mr. Harding was dressed in black, the woman all in white, white gloves, &c. she was conduced to the scaffold by Mr. Ford, the Ordinary. After Mr. Ford had delivered his pious exhortation to these three unhappy persons, the platform fell, and Mr. Ford, who happened to be standing upon it the time, came to the ground. We are concerned to state, that he was much bruised. He was assisted into Mr. Newman's house immediately. The woman struggled much before she died. Cubitt appeared almost insensible, from the moment he was brought out to the scaffold. The concourse of people that attended the execution was immense. The Sheriffs and City Marshals, Nalder and Holdsworth, were present upon the occasion.— John Burrows, a youth of 17, who was also under sentence of death, has been respited tor 14 days. His unhappy parents left town yesterday, overwhelmed with grief, considering his fate inevitable.

Saint James's Chronicle - Thursday 02 May 1805

_ OLD BAILEY—Monday, April 29.  
*John Blacklin* was indicted for feloniously vending playing cards, having a forged Ace of Spades. It appears that he sold the cards in packs of 51 each; and in another pack he delivered as many forged Aces of Spades. The duty on a pack of cards is 2s. 6d. but the prisoner sold his cards at 14s. per dozen packs. It was argued, that the cards thus disposed of could not be deemed complete packs; but this objection was over-ruled, and the prisoner was found guilty, but was recommended to mercy.

Tuesday, April 30.  
*Maydewall* and *Knype* were indicted for uttering forged stamps on the Ace of Spades, knowing them to be so. The fact of uttering was completely proved ; but the prisoners in their defence declared their ignorance of the forgery, which the Jury gave credit to by a verdict of acquittal.

Morning Herald (London) - Tuesday 20 August 1805
SUICIDE.—An elderly Lady, near 70 years of age, put a period to her existence on Wednefday evening last, near Weybridge, in Surrey. She was the wife of Mr. JOHN SKELTON, Tea-dealer, in Green-street, Grosvenor-square, and had been for some time desponding in her mind; in consequence of which, she had been at various places for the recovery of her health, and had latterly been on a visit to the family of Mr. BENNETT, near Weybridge. On Tuesday morning, after partaking of a hearty breakfafi, she observed to the family, that she would take a short walk, being of opinion it would do her good, and with unusual earnestness bid them " Good bye," but returned shortly, and, tbaking them by the hands, said, " God bids you! God bids you!" Expecting her return, the family waited with the utmost anxiety for the space of two hours ; but not returning, they sent messengers after her. After a considerable search, she was found on the following morning sitting upright in a ditch, with her throat cut from ear to ear, and a pen-knife lying by her side, which she generally carried in her pocket. A Coroner's Inquest was summoned, and the evidence adduced proved these facts, with the addition, that the whole of the day on which the disappeared was spent in a hay-field, where some haymakers were at work, who observed her walking backwards and forwards. The Jury refurned a verdict of *Lunacy*.—The unhappy Lady was very much repsected, for the urbanity and gentleness with which on all occasions she conducted herself, and was the mother of a fine family of children, all of whom are arrived at puberty.

Morning Post - Monday 23 September 1805
OLD BAILEY. — Saturday, Sept. 21. *Richard Harding* was indicted on two counts ; the first charging him with forging, fabricating, and publishing, as true, a stamp on the spade ace ; and second, with selling and uttering the same playing cards, well knowing such stamp to be forged. The case was opened at great length by the Attorney-General.

Mr. Hockley, the printer of the legal spade ace stamps, stated that he had purchased of the prisoner's apprentice, and of him-self, various packs of cards, the aces of spades in each pack being spurious. These purchases were very frequent, and took place in the month of June, 1804. It appeared that the prisoner kept two shops, one in Hereford-street, Oxofrd-street, and the other in North-row, Grosvenor-square, where he sold cards. It was also proved that the prisoner occupied, privately, premises behind the house of Mr. Skelton, Green-street, Grosvenor-square. A body of evidence was then adduced, in order to shew that the prisoner had employed a stone seal engraver, of the name of Leadbeater, to execute aces of spades for him. Having prevailed on Leadbeater to learn the art of engraving on copper, the expence of which he was to pay. Mr. Woodthorpe, a respectable engraver, in Fetter-lane, was applied to, and he took Leadbeater under his tuition. The prisoner frequently called on him, and one day he shewed him an old plate of the spade ace, wnich he wished to be touched up. Leadbeater was unable to do the job, winch was delivered to Bunning, an apprentice, who was to put the name of Blanchard on the plate. Bunning was imposed on, for he was told that the plate was for Mr. Shepherd, at the Stamp Office.

Rivett, Millar, and Carpmeal, searched the premises occupied by the prisoner, at the back of Skelton's house, where they found a quantity of counterfeit stamp aces, and a quantity of plates tor fabricating stamps, which were concealed under ground. In the counterfeit aces, in the word *Dieu*, in the motto, in the letter R. was substituted for the letter F.

Mr. Justice Heath addressed the Jury, and observed there could be no doubt in the case. The Jury found the prisoner guilty— *Death*.

Old Bailey, Sept. 21.
Richard Harding was capitally indicted for forging and counterfeiting certain stamps, or Stamp-office marks, the ace of spades, on playing cards, and vending and uttering the same, knowing them to be forged and counterfeited, contrary to the statute of the 44th of the King.

This was trial of considerable interest, carried on at the prosecution of the Commissioners of Stamp Duties. The prisoner was card-maker, in a most eminent and respectable line of trade, and carried on his business at two different houses, licensed for the purpose, viz. Hereford-Street, Oxford-road, and Green-street, Grosvenor-square. The suspicions against the prisoner were excited in the Commissioners by the very small number of stamps he took out in proportion to the extensive line of business he carried on; consequence of which they employed persons to purchase different quantities of cards at his house, from the examination of which the forgeries were detected.

The prosecution was opened by Mr. Dampier, and the case stated by the Attorney-General; Mr. Garrow and Mr. Knapp were also for the prosecution, and Mr. Alley and Mr. Gurney for the prisoner.

The evidence adduced was nearly of the same nature with that brought forward against the persons who were some Sessions ago convicted of a similar offence. It was proved that the prisoner had the plates in his possession for stamping the card, and that he had been seen working upon them.

The prisoner adduced evidence to disprove any one of the charges, but a number of most respectable tradesmen from his own neighbourhood, who knew him for a series of years, gave him most excellent character.

The Jury, after a short consultation, found a verdict of *Guilty*——DEATH.

OLD BAILEY. Saturday 18 were tried at the Old Bailey, five whom were capitally convicted, viz. R. Harding, for counterfeiting the Ace of Spades, with intent to defraud the revenue. Our Readers must recollect that several persons hare already been tried for Vending playing cards, with forged duty aces, knoWing them to be fraudulent and fabriaceted, and that one Blacklin is now under sentence of death for the same. It appeared in the course of the evidence in this case, that the prisoner, who was some time back a card-maker near Oxford-street, had procured several men to engrave the plates, and to embark in the unlawful practice, by the most deceitful representations, and through their means he had carried on a traffic to a degree exceeding all calculation. He procured and worked off the duty aces, which he sold to other dealers at a rate comparatively nothing with the Government duty, and yet he must have amassed great sums of money.

Bell's Weekly Messenger - Sunday 22 September 1805
On Friday 18 prisoners were tried, one of whom was capitally convicted. ...
Yesterday Richard Harding was capitally indicted for forging, fabricating, uttering, and publishing as true, a stamp the spade ace, with intent to defraud the revenue.

The Attokney General opened the case on the part of the prosecution, in a very long speech, in which he stated to the Jury the outline of the prisoner’s transactions. The first witness called was Mr. Hockley, the printer of the legal spade ace at the Stamp-Office. He had very frequently made purchases of packs of cards of the prisoner, as had also his apprentice, and the stamps on the aces of spades were all forges. These purchases, which were very numerous, took place in the month of June 1804. It appeared by the evidence adduced on the part of the prosecution, that the prisoner kept two shops, where these packs of cards were sold, the one in Hereford-street, Oxford-street, and the other in North-row, near Grosvenor-square. The prisoner’s apprentice deposed, that he saw his master making cards on one occasion, and observed him to paste labels on them, which he gave a gloss to by putting some liquid on them. Witness also proved that the prisoner occupied premises behind the 

house of Mr. Skelton, Green-street, Grosvenor square. A body of evidence was adduced to prove that the prisoner had employed a seal engraver of the name of Leadbeater to execute aces of spades for him. Leadbeater dined with the prisoner two years since, when he asked him if he could engrave on copper. On being answered the negative, the prisoner requested he would find some trusty artist in that branch. Leadbeater recommended a youth of the name of White, who, the prisoner was informed, could be depended on. Four duty aces were given to Leadbeater for White to imitate as closely possible, and if he was asked any questions, was to say they were for a foreigner at Hamburg. White, however, was timid, and all negociations With him was abandoned. In six or seven months after, the prisoner pressed on Leadbeater to learn the art of engraving copper, adding, that he would be at the expence of a master. Mr. Woodthorpe, a respectable engraver in Fetter-lane, waa applied to, and the witness was placed under his tuition. The prisoner's visits to Leadbeater was very frequent, and one day he showed him an old plate of the spade ace, which he wished to be touched up. Witness was unable to do the job, and an apprentice of the name of Bunning was employed, under the impression that the plate was for Mr. Shepherd of the Stamp Office. It was also proved, in evidence, that the prisoner had large dealings with Mr. Skelton for spirits, &c. for which he gave *waste paper*; that is, packs of cards, which Mr. S. sold st a profit. Rivctt, Miliar, and Carpmeal, searched the premises occupied by the prisoner, at tbe back of Mr. Skelton's house. They found a quantity of forged stamps of the spade ace, and also a quantity of forged plates for frabricating the stamps, which were concealed under ground. In the counterfeit aces, in the word"Dieu*", in the motto the letter R. was substituted for the letter E. Mr, Justice Heath addressed the Jury, and observed, there could doubt in the case. The Jury found the prisoner *Guilty*, *Death*. The prisoner is a genteel man, 35 years of age, and he was dressed in black, and full powdered!

General Evening Post - Tuesday 24 September 1805

Old Bailey, Saturday, Sept. 21

Richard Harding was capitally indicted for forging and counterfeiting certain stamps, or Stamp Office marks, of the Ace of Spades, on playing cards, and vending and uttering the same knowng them to be forged and counterfeited, contrary to the statute of the 44th of the King.

This was a trial of cosiderable interest, carried on at the prosecution of the Commissioners of Stamp Duties. The prisoner was a cardmaker, in a most eminent and respectable line of trade, and carried on his busienss at two different houses, licensed for the purpose, viz. in Hereford-street, Oxford-road, and in Green0street, Grosvenor-square. The suspicions against the prisoner were excited in the Commissioners by the very small number of stamps he took out, in proportion to the extensive line of business he carried on; in consequence of which they employed persons to purchase different quantities of cards at his hiouse, from the examination of which the forgeries were detected.

The prosecution was opened by Mr, Dampier, and the case stated by the Attorney General; Mr. Garrow and Mr. Knapp qwere also for the prosecution; and Mr. Alley and Mr. Gurney for the prisoner.

John Hockey, an officer in the Stamp Office, whose peculiar business is to print the Ace of Spades for the card-dury department, deposed that he was sent, on the 14th of May last, by order of the Commissioners of Stamps, to purchase some cards of the prisoner, at his house, in Hereford-street. The prisoner was not at home, but he purchased six packs of a lad, hois servant, named Lepine. On the 16th, he went again, and bought six packs of the prisoner himself, and paid him 21s; he went again on the 24th, and puchased twleve packs, paying 41s.; he went again, on a subsequent day, and order five dozen to be sent to his house, No. 74, Edgeware-road, which were accordingly set, with a receipt for the purchase money; witness was not at home when they were brought. The several parcels were produced, and the witness identified them as purchased and marked by him at the time. Said, he had been thirteen years in his present department at the tamp Office, was well acquainted with the marks there were always impressed on the Ace of Spades; and said, he immediately knew those Aces on the cards he purchased at the prisoner's to be forged, as one in particular had an error in the first word of the motto of the Royal Arms, being spelled *Dier* instead of *Dieu*.

Stephen Lepine deposed, that he was apprenticed with the prisoner 2 years, ending the 8th instant. He has seen the prisoner engaged in making cards and pasting wrappers, and when the cards were made up, witness has frequently seen the prisoner take something out of a bottle, and put it on the stamp of the wrapper, for the purpose, as he thought, of giving it a gloss. He has seen copper plates in the possession of the prisoner, and he remembers having delivered cards, in his master's shop, to Mr. Hockey. He knew nothing more of the plates than having seen then in his possession. He knew a person named Leadbeater, whom he has seen with the prisoner, and who used to bring him plates for cards and bills of parcels. The prisoner carried on his business only in North-row, and Hereford-street, and no where else as the witness knew.

A witness, named Leadbeater, deposed, that he lodges at No. 65, Well-stree, Oxford-road, and is a stone seal engraver. has known the prisoner three years; remembers having dined with the prisoner at his house on a Sunday about two years since; after dinner the prisoner called him aside in another room, shut the door, and asked him if he could engrave on copper; witness said no, but he knew a young man who did, named White. The prisoner paused some time, and then asked if he could be depended upon? Witness answered *he* would endeavour to get done for him anything he wanted. Prisoner said he would call on him in a few days, which he did at the witness's lodgings, in Greek-street, and brought with hime four copies of the *Duty Ace of Spades*, with the name of the seller cut off, and told him to take them to White and get them copied as close as he could, and if White should ask any questions, to say they were for a foreginer at Hamburgh. Witness carried them to White, and asked him if he would copy them; White said he would call and let him know next day: when he did see him, and White said, for God's sake Leadbeater take care what you are about; adding, that he could engrave them, but he must give them into the hands of a Magistrate.— Witness then said, it was a cardmaker of his acquaintance that gave them to him, and afterwards went and told the prisoner what passed, and that White said it was a forgery. The prisoner answered it was no such thing, and desired witness to call on White again and tell him to do them, and any money he might ask he should have : but White said he would have nothing to do with them, but thought the witness knew who they were for. Saw White no more; nothing farther passed for six or seven months ; witness afterwards lodged at 42, Great Titchfield-street, whither the prisoner came to him and asked him if he thought he could do the cards himself; witness said NO, but that he thought he might soon learn with instructions; prisoner desired him to look out for and agree with some proper person to instruct him, and he would pay the expence ; and witness accordingly applied to Mr. Woodthorpe, an engraver in Fetter-lane, who agreed, for twenty guineas to instruct him. The prisoner frequently asked him, while under Mr. Woodthorpe's instruction, how he came on ; and at one time asked him if he could not copy the Ace of Spades, as he was much distressed since the poor old *Baronet*, who used to do them for him the last sixteen years was dead. He afterwards brought the witness copper plate with 24 Aces of Spades and asked him if he could *touch it up* (a term used by the engravers for repairing a plate). Witness said he would try, and on the Sunday following went to dine with the prisoner, who after dinner brought him into a room with the plate, and locked the dour. Witness tried to touch it up, but could not. The prisoner came to him in a quarter of an hour. Witness remembers the numbers this plate were 1, 2, 6, 7. Prisoner came again to his lodgings, and asked him if he could engrave on brass, which he answered in the negative ; he brought a plate with him under his coat, with twenty Aces of Spades upon it, and told the witness to copy 14, 15, 19, 20,  which witness said he would, and employed a young man named Bunning, an apprentice to Mr Woodthorpe, to do it ; gave the plate afterwards to the prisoner, who said it was very neatly done, and came shortly afterwards to have another done, but instead of the name of Harding, to put in that of Blanchard, and gave him an Exportation Ace to copy from; this done he came again, and ordered two more with the name Harding, and the duty on, observing, that if he worked too much on one plate, he should be found out. Witness remembers at the time when Harding and Lee were taken taken. The officers had been to his house, and the prisoner gave him instructions, if he was asked any questions, to say he knew nothing about the business. Witness was apprehended in June, and at that time there were two of the prisoner's plates in his house, which the prisoner had brought to have some more printed.

*Cross-examoned by Mr. Gurney.* Witnes said, he had told Bunning, who engraved those plates, that they were for Mr. Shepherd, Engraver to the Stamp Office: that he himself was taken up three times after his first examination, that he was a little afraid for his neck; acknowledged that the first and second accounts he gave to the Magistrates of the transaction were very different, and neither true, but said that he would abide by the last account he had given, as that was the truth. The others he acknowledged to be false, though all taken before the same Magistrate.

Christopher Bunning supported the testimony of the last witness, so far as concerned him.

Mr. Skelton a grocer, in Green-street, Grosvenour-square, deposed, that the prisoner was originally his shopman; about two years since he took from him a warehouse in his back-yard, of which the prisoner generally kept the key, but sometimes lieft it at his house. He had a copper-plate press in this room, and occupied it in printing Aces of Spades, at which the witness never saw him particularly employed but once, so as to see what he was printing. The prisoner himself frequently came there, sometimes twice a day, and often not for days together : he had frequently seen him at work there, with an apron before him, and flannel jacket on. He dealt with the witness for spirits and groceries, and used to give him other commodities in exchange, called *waste paper*; the commodity so called was playing cards, in perfect packs, made up in white paper, not sealed, charged to the witness 17s. 6d. per dozen packs, and sold again by him at a profit. He sometimes had four, five, or six dozen at a time. This traffic continued for some time before the prisoner had taken the witness's back-premises. It was not the witness who kept the account current, but his wife, who died some time since—(here the witness burst into tears. His late wife was the unfortunate person who some weeks since put an end to her existence at a village some distance from town, under the tortures of mind she experienced on the subject of this business). His house was searched at the time the prisoner was taken, and an acconnt current between them in the handwriting of the prisoner, found there, which the prisoner the day before had brought and given him, and desired him to take care of it, but did not then explain his reasons. The officers searched also the back-house, and found the flannel jacket and other articles, all the prisoner's property. The prisoner also brought him a large roll of papers in blue wrapper, and desired him to put it safe out of the way, and the witness took it to the lodging of his daughter, and placed it in her custody; she did not know what it contained. The officers came there a second time and found some copper plates, by digging in garden, near the privy ; they were placed there, as he supposes, by the prisoner, as he had told them they were. He acknowledged the officers dug for them his direction.

Edward Stone, a servant of the prisoner, said it was part of his business to cut aces of spades to perfect packs, once a month : they were twenty on a sheet ; he never saw any there with less. He fewer within the last six months befere the prisoner was apprehended than in the six months preceding.

John Rivett, a Bow Street Officer, deposed, that he went with Carpmeal and Miller, on the 25th June, to Hereford-street, and apprehended the prisoner, his apprentice, and another servant of his. Nothing particular was found there; went to Leadbeater's, and there found two copperplates of the ace of spades, and some paper, on the top of a rolling press. Went also to Skelton's, and there found, in the room behind the yard, an iron fly press, two rowllers of a rolling-press, a flannel jacket, a. red-ink ball, and a marble slab; on searching the dust hole below, they found the remainder of the rolling-press, and the plates hid under ground in the garden ; in the back room there were three gross of packs of cads made up, but without the aces of spades. On the 9th of July they went again to Leadbeater's, and found the plates, with aces of spades in the privy. In the house of Mr. Shingler they found, in a box with foul linen, a roll of papers containing impressions of the ace of spades.

An Officer of the Stamp Office proved that this parcel contained 3000 impressions of the ace of spades.

The Distributor of Stamps proved that the ace of spaces he delivers out to the card-makers are always twenty on a sheet ; and consequently no aces not so printed have been printed at the Stamp Office.

Here closed the evidence for the prosecution ; the prisoner adduced no evidence to disprove any one of the charges, but a number of most respectable tradesmen from his own neighbourhood, who knew him for a series of years gave him a most excellent character.

The Jury, after a short consultation, found a verdict *Guilty*, *Death*. —Aged 35.

Hampshire Chronicle - Monday 22 December 1806

On Wednesday last a most melancholy circumstance occurred on Southsea Common. Mr. W. A. Limerick, in company with Mr. J. Hyde, Mr. W. Hamilton, and Mr. W. Wilkinson, having agreed to shoot at a mark for a wager, assembled near the bathing machines for the purpose of deciding the bet; when, having fixed the ace of spades to a post, they withdrew to a distance of twelve yards. Limerick, by the consent of the party, was to have the first fire; he accordingly pulled the trigger of his pistol, which hung fire, when he removed, and another of the party came up to fire. Limerick had moved but a very short distance, when he received a ball in his right side, which passed through his body, grasing both his arras. The ball came from the pistol of Mr. Hamilton, which accidentally went off as he was about to fire at the card.— Mr. Limerick immediately dropped his pistol, and, after running about 50 yards, fell down. He was taken to the bathing-house, and from thence to the Crown Inn, where he expired early the next morning. The most perfect friendship existed amongst them; and the unfortunate deceased made oath before his death that it was accidental. A coroner's inquest was held on the body, and a verdict of *accidental death* returned. Mr. Limerick had recently got his appointment as a writer in the East India Company's service, and was waiting to take his passage in the General Stuart East Indiaman,  to India, where his father is, and from whom he has been absent years. He was buried on Saturday morning in the Garrison Chapel. The other gentlemen belonged to the General Stuart.

RICHARD HARDING was indicted for that he, on the 24th of May , feloniously did forge, counterfeit, and resemble, on the spotted side on one of the cards in a certain parcel of playing cards, the impression of a certain mark used and denoted on the spotted side of playing cards, with intention to defraud the duty charged on playing cards .

Second Count. For feloniously vending and selling, on the same day, certain playing cards, with counterfeit impressions of certain marks used and denoted upon playing cards, he at the time knowing the said marks to be counterfeited. And

Thirteen other Counts for like offence, only charging them in a different manner.

(The indictment was read by Mr. Dampier.)

Mr. Attorney General. - Gentlemen, This prosecution, we all understand, is against the prisoner for an offence which he has committed against the stamp laws, and the indictment charges him with having counterfeited the impression of stamps authorised by the Commissioners for the purpose of denoting the duty on playing cards; it charges him likewise of vending and selling cards with these counterfeited impressions, knowing it to be so done.

Gentlemen, The act under which the prisoner is prosecuted makes it a capital offence for either counterfeiting, vending, or selling cards with counterfeited stamps, the person so acting having a guilty knowledge thereof.

Gentlemen, Having stated these circumstances to you, I conceive I must do more, in order to apprise you of the serious and important business in which we are now engaged. The prisoner at the bar is a licensed card-maker, having two licensed shops, the one situated in Hereford-street, Oxford-street, and the other in North-row, Grosvenor-square; I shall shew you that in these two places he carried on the manufacturing and selling of playing cards. There was another place the prisoner had, which was even unknown even to the servants that were employed in either of these manufactories, in which almost all the infamous part was transacted by the prisoner himself alone.

Gentlemen, The extensive manner in which he carried on this business, compared with the small demand he made at the Stamp office for stamps to have legally carried it on, was one of the first circumstances that appeared against the prisoner, and that a fraudulent fabrication were made and vended, to a large extent, in lieu of the legal one, there was not the least doubt. And in consequence of this, and likewise from some other circumstances, it came sufficiently to the knowledge of the persons employed at the Stamp-office that there must be some illegal practice carried on. It was thought expedient to employ one Hockey, who is the printer of the legal ace of spades at the Stamp-office, in order to see if they could detect him in the improper practice he was carrying on, and this employment of Mr. Hockey has led to the discovery for which the prisoner is now brought here. It was in the month of May, I think the 14th, that Mr. Hockey made the first purchase; he called at his house, and asked for six packs of playing cards, Mr. Harding was not at home, but a servant furnished him with the six packs of playing cards; the charge that was made for them was about a guinea, nothing at all under what would be the trade price bought at a regular manufactory; Mr. Hockey having purchased these six packs of cards, he found that they contained all the marks and impressions of forged stamps, and he was satisfied in his own mind that they were undoubtedly forged. He was not contented with making this purchase, he went on the 16th, and purchased six packs more; Mr. Harding then was at home, and served him himself. On the 21st he made another purchase, when the same servant furnished him with six packs more, and on the 24th of May he purchased a dozen packs; the cards in this dozen were furnished him by the prisoner himself. On the 27th, he went again to the shop, and ordered five dozen to be sent to No. 74, Edgware-road; these cards were sent accordingly, and the person that carried them will be called; he will tell you (he was in the habit of giving receipts not in his master's name;) he asked his master in what name he should give the receipt, his master told him to give the receipt in any name he pleased; he was instructed where to carry them, and he gave the receipt in the name of Bates. When he returned he told his master, and his master was very well satisfied with it.

Gentlemen, This circumstance was in order to prevent the easy communication of tracing back these packs of cards; for all these and every one of those different packs of cards which were purchased on those specific days, in the month of May, contained the forged impressions of these counterfeited stamps, and the prosecution against the prisoner was supposed to be complete by these various instances of selling these counterfeited impressions. In consequence of that, it was thought fit to apprehend him, and to make a seizure from which informationmight be collected from the circumstances of the manner in which it was carried on. He was apprehended, and several of his servants were likewise laid hold of at the time; and from this remarkable circumstance it is evident that the prisoner must have become acquainted previously, that there was that suspicion ripened against him, that it was likely that he should be the subject of apprehension; for upon the seizure of the stock there was not one single forged impression found, although down to the twenty-fourth of May he had, wherever the sale had been made, sold cards with these counterfeited impressions; they were all removed before the apprehension and seizure; that unquestionably by some means or other the prisoner must have been apprised thereof. After the apprehension of the prisoner, the persons that assisted him in carrying on this nefarious business, who were taken at the same time, became the subjects of examination, and the connection and acquaintance of the prisoner were discovered; and that a person of the name of Leadbetter was the engraver that was employed by the prisoner, and a person of the name of Skelton was one that had considerable dealings with him; that they were frequently employed in carrying cards to Mr. Skelton, who lived somewhere near Grosvenor-square. I shall shew to you the manner in which the prisoner at the bar first seduced Leadbetter, and the manner in which Leadbetter seduced Bunning - I can hardly say seduced, employed Bunning. That the prisoner at the bar actually paid for Leadbetter's instruction in the art of engraving on copper-plates, he being a stone seal-engraver; and after the prisoner had actually paid for the instruction of Leadbetter, he was anxious to know whether he could execute a plate for him. Leadbetter attempted not only to touch up a plate, but also to engrave others for him; but in consequence of his not being able to do it for him, he was desirous of getting it done for him; he employed a man of the name of Bunning, who was himself an engraver in this line. Leadbetter led him to believe that he was acquainted with a drunken engraver who worked for the Stamp-office, who would lose his business if he did not get some able hand to do them for him. These are the outlines of the case, in which, if the facts are brought home to him, I am sure you will not entertain a doubt of the propriety of the prosecution against the prisoner, Mr. Harding.

Gentlemen, I shall first state to you what it is we have to prove against him; I shall then state what is necessary to prove against the prisoner by the detail already applied to the facts. The first thing to be proved against him is vending these articles, knowing them to be counterfeited - for vending these packs of cards with the counterfeited impressions of the stamps, he knowing them to be counterfeited, rather than the actual counterfeiting of the impressions of that stamp. I shall shew to you that at the early stage of the business evident proof of his having vended these articles in considerable quantities to a person of the name of Hockey, and that Hockey will shew to you, beyond all possibility of a doubt, that he sold these cards with the counterfeited impressions on them; and to establish that fact, that he knew they were counterfeited, I shall here state the manner in which the duty stamps are carried on at the Stamp-office. This will of itself make it next to impossibility that any trader carrying on the business as this man did, could possibly sell or vend cards without knowing they were false. The duty on playing cards is upon the whole two shillings and sixpence; there is a duty of sixpence on the wrapper; and with respect to the ace of spades particularly, the Office makes a plate for every dealer, and upon that plate for every dealer they put the dealer's name. Every dealer, therefore, must know, that in order to get a legal ace of spades, he must have the ace of spades that is furnished by the Stamp-office themselves; he cannot get it from any other quarter. If any dealer is furnished with any other ace of spades, he must know that they were forged; for on looking upon the legal impression of the duty ace, there is charged sixpence upon the top, and sixpence on each side, and then there is the name of Harding, or of the dealer, that is, the card-maker, at the bottom; and any card-maker getting it from any other quarter, must know that he has got a false impression.

Gentlemen, This case will by no means rest here; but I shall shew to you the actual employment of the prisoner, and who it was that made the fabricated plate. I shall shew you by one of his servants that he had a plate in his possession of the ace of spades, and that he saw him polish the impression that is made on the label fabricated stamp, to give it that gloss which the legal stamp does, in order to meet the eye, and to be less liable of detection. You will find from his servants that, for several weeks before the time that he was apprehended, he had taken upon himself entirely the whole management of that part of the business which consisted of making the aces of spades. The legal aces of spades have twenty impressions upon a sheet of paper of a large size at the Stamp-office; they are cut in shape, and put on one side of the cards by the card-maker; they are progressively numbered from one to twenty. The plate that the prisoner procured to be fabricated, only contained four of these impressions, and when you come to examine the particulars of the plate, you will find that some of them are not correct with the original of which they were intended; for I think they have got an R instead of the E in the word Dieu. In this instance it points out, beyond all possibility of a doubt, that it is a forgery.

Gentlemen, You will find that he kept this part of the business to himself for six months before he was apprehended; that he cut these out, and pasted them on the cards; that he delivered the aces of spades, which were to be included in these packs, himself; and I apprehend from this circumstance of Leadbetter being actually employed and engaged by the prisoner to acquire that knowledge by which he was to fabricate the legal stamps, will make it beyond all doubt that he knew they were forged. I have pointed out these other circumstances, independent of the proof of Leadbetter, and particularly independent of the proof which will be given on the part of Skelton, because both Lead-better and Skelton will come before you as men who are more or less implicated in the guilt of the prisoner himself. With respect to Leadbetter, there is no doubt but he must know what these stamps were; and with respect to Skelton, there can be but little doubt, if any, but that he must have known the iniquitous purpose of these stamps. He will tell you that he knew theprisoner many years; that he let him part of his premises in a back yard behind his house, and that in these premises the prisoner carried on this nefarious business; he had often seen him, and often heard him make use of the instrument for forging these stamps. I say I will desire the keeping the case, as much as I can, without the assistance of these accomplices, because I think, without their assistance, there would be very near, if not quite, sufficient to prove the case against the prisoner. At Mr. Skelton's, and at the house of a person of the name of Shinglear, were found not less than two thousand aces that had been made by Harding, the prisoner, he having removed them from his premises the very night before his apprehension to elude every means of indicating the forged business being carried on by him.

Gentlemen, Some of the plates were found in the garden at Skelton's, and two were found in the possession of Leadbetter, to whom they had been returned by Harding, for the purpose of his secreting them. You will find that there is abundant proof against the prisoner at the bar, even if you were to put out the evidence of Skelton, or of Leadbetter, they being persons that were accomplices. You will be directed to give a very anxious attention to their evidence, and to be watchful whether their evidence is confirmed, and if it is confirmed, you may give the same reliance to that as to any other evidence. In this case you will give attention to the whole of it - how far the evidence supports the facts, and how far upon the whole these facts make out the case of guilt against the prisoner. In my mind it seems to be a case in which there will not be a possibility of a doubt, but it will be for you to determine.

Mr. Dampier. Q. After dinner did any thing pass between you? - A. Some little time after dinner he called me on one side and said, I shall be glad to speak to you; and after that I went up stairs with him, and he said, Leadbetter, can you, or do you engrave on copper: I said, no, I could not, it was quite out of my profession; I replied that I knew a young man of the name of White, who was an engraver in that line, and I supposed he would do what he wanted to get done; Mr. Harding paused a little time, and he returned back and said, White you have mentioned, do you think this White can be depended on; or can I, or may I depend on you: To that reply I told him, I would do my endeavour to get what he might want done.

Q. Did he tell you what? - A. No; I told him I had known White from a lad, even from an apprentice.

Q. What Did Mr. Harding say upon that? - A. He said he would call upon me in the course of the next week; then he went away.

Q. How soon afterwards was it that you saw Mr. Harding? - A. About three weeks.

Q. Where was that? - A. He came to my lodgings, which were, at that time, No. 3, Greek-street.

Q. Had he any thing with him when he came? - A. He brought with him four duty aces of spades with the name of Harding cut off.

Q. You can only tell a name was cut off; what did he say to you? - A. He told me to take that to Mr. White and tell him to copy it as close as he could, and if he should ask any questions, to tell him it was for a foreigner at Hambro'; he then went away.

Q. Did you carry these to White? - A. Yes, I did.

Q. Did any conversation pass between you and White? - A. Yes.

Q. Did you tell him what passed between you and White? - A. Yes, I had some difficulty to find him; I met him in Long-acre, and he took me into some shops; I asked him to call at my lodgings, which he did; I asked him to engrave me a plate and to call on me to-morrow; when he came, he said, Leadbetter, for God's sake, do you know what you are doing of? I told him I did not; he then said, he could engrave these aces, but if he did, he must give them into the hands of a Magistrate, for he had asked a question of his friend, who was a card-maker, and he told him that.

Q. How soon afterwards did you see Harding? - A. The next day he came to me.

Q. Now then at that time did you inform Harding of what you have told us, of what White said to you? - A. Yes.

Q. What did Harding say to that? - A. He still persisted it was no such thing; I told him that White told me it was a forgery; he insisted it was no such thing, he said he was a poor fool, and knew no better.

Q. What further did he say? - A. He told me to go to White again, and to tell him that no harm should come to him if he would do it, and more than that, whatever money he wanted or asked he should have, and that he should have the money first.

Q. Did you see White afterwards, to inform him of that? - A. I did.

Q. Would White do them? - A. He told me that he would have nothing to do in it, for he thought that I knew who they were for.

Q. After that, I believe, you never saw White? - A. No.

Q. Did you see Harding soon afterwards? - A. Yes.

Q. Did he come to you, or did you go to him? - A. I think I went and told him what White had said.

Q. What did he say to that? - A. There was nothing more passed after that; he never took any more notice about engraving for six or seven months.

Q. I think you lodged, then, in Greek-street? - A. Yes.

Q. After that you lodged in Titchfield-street, No. 42? - A. Yes.

Q. Did you there see Mr. Harding? - A. Yes, about six or seven months after the time I was speaking of, he came to my lodgings in Titchfield-street, he asked me and said, do you think in your own mind, you could learn to engrave on copper: I then told him I did not know, but I thought I might; upon which he said, if you will get some one to instruct you, I will pay for your instruction: upon which I applied to several people, and I was recommended to Mr. Woodthorpe, in Fetter-lane, to whom I went; he told me to call again on the next day, when I went to him, and he would give me an answer; he did afterwards do it.

Q. Did he undertake to instruct you afterwards? - A. He did.

Q. For what sum was he to instruct you? - A. For twenty pounds or guineas, I think guineas.

Q. Who paid that money? - A. Mr. Harding, he furnished me with that money to pay Mr. Woodthorpe.

Q. After you had been with Mr. Woodthorpe a competent time, did he come to you to see how you improved? - A. He asked me if I had practised enough to touch up a plate for him; I then asked him what that plate was; he told me it was a plate of the aces of spades; and he said that the poor old man - the poor old Baronet that did it for him was dead.

Q. Did you endeavour to do it? - A. I told him I could not.

Q. After that did he come to you again? - A. Yes.

Q. How long afterwards was it, a week or a month? - A. It might be a month.

Q. Did he come to you again? - A. He came to me again, and asked me how I came on with Woodthorpe; I told him very well.

Q. Did he then shew you any thing? - A. Yes.

Q. What was it? - A. He came and shewed me a plate of four duty aces of spades.

Q. What did he say he wanted to be done with it? - A. He said he wanted it to be touched up;and then we walked to the other end of the room, and said, had I better touch it up here, or come to his house to do it; I told him to do as he pleased; he then said, come to my house; I went and dined there, it was on a Sunday, and after dinner he shut me into a room, and gave me some gravers, and told me to do the best I could with them.

Q. How did he shut you in the room? - A. He locked the door; I tried to do it, but finding I could not do it, I left off; he came into the room about the dusk of the evening, he said, Leadbetter, what have you done? I told him I had done a little, I did not know whether it would do or no; with that he said, never mind it now, I will try to do it myself.

Q. Do you recollect at all what the number were? - A. To the best of my knowledge it was one, two, six, and seven.

Q. Did you see him afterwards? - A. Yes.

Q. Was it at your lodgings that he came again? - A. Yes, he came to my lodgings.

Q. Did he ask you any further questions? - A. He said, he did not mind telling me what he wanted.

Q. What did he want? - A. He asked me if I could engrave on brass with my own machine; I told him, I could not.

Mr. Dampier. The witness is a stone engraver.

Q. He asked you if you could engrave on brass? - A. I told him I could not, my tools were made of the softest iron I could get.

Q. Did he afterwards ask you of your progress with Mr. Woodthorpe? - A. He came again, and asked me how I came on with Mr. Woodthorpe; I told him as before, very well. He brought me a plate under his coat, and gave me a sheet of aces of spades.

Q. Containing the number of twenty? - A. Yes.

Q. Such a one as this? - A. Yes.

Q. What did he say to you? - A. He told me that he would be glad if I would copy fourteen, fifteen, nineteen, and twenty, and do them as close as possible I could, he was so distressed he did not know what to do; I then told him I would. Finding I was not capable of doing it, I employed a man of the name of Bunning.

Q. Did you communicate to Harding that you had employed Bunning? - A. No, I did not.

Q. Did you give Bunning the plate, and did Bunning do the plate? - A. He did.

Q. Did you give the plate so done by Bunning to Harding? - A. I did.

Q. When you gave it to him, what did he say to it? - A. He said it was not a proper thing to be done; Bunning said that.

Q. Now, when you gave the plate to Harding which Bunning had worked upon, did Harding make any observation upon it? - A. He looked at it, and said it was very neatly done.

Q. What did he do upon that - did he give you any other plate? - A. He came a very short time afterwards, and told me that he liked that plate very well that I had done, and he would be obliged to me to do another, and put the name of Blanchard in; he gave me an exportation ace, a sheet of the same size as one of them; I gave it to Bunning with his directions, and got it done.

Q. Did you give that to Harding? - A. I did.

Q. Some time after that did he come to you again? - A. Yes.

Q. What did he say to you? - A. He asked me if I had done the plates; I told him, yes; he said he would be obliged to me if I would do one or two more, with the name of Harding, duty aces not for exportation; I did two Blanchards, and then he came again for me to do a Harding, because he said he should be found out working on one number.

Q. Did you give that to Bunning? - A. I did.

Q. Was that done by Bunning? - A. Yes.

Q. And afterwards given by you to Harding? - A. Yes.

Q. Did you ever see him again with one of the Blanchard plates? - A. Yes, he came to me again to see if I would take out the palm-branch; the exportation aces are with palm-branches, and the duty aces are with leaves on them; I was to take out the palm-branch, and to put in the leaves; I was to make some alteration that they should not be exactly to pattern; it was taken out, but the alteration was not made, I had not time.

Q. Do you remember the bustle there was about Lee and Hardy? - A. Yes.

Q. About that time Blacklin was prosecuted, and Lee ran away? - A. Yes, he came to me, and said, for God sake, help me to bury the plates; for, said he, they have been searching my house; upon which I did.

Q. Did he give you any directions? - A. He told me to bury them; then he came again, and said, let me have them; he took the plates, and brought them again in the course of a day or two, and I buried them.

Q. Did he tell you what you were to do if you were asked about them? - A. Yes; he said if they came to me, and asked me any thing about it, to to say I knew nothing of any such thing.

Q. Do you remember the time you were apprehended? - A. I think it was the 25th of June.

Q. At that time were there any of these plates at your house? - A. Two.

Q. Who had brought them there? - A. Mr. Harding.

Q. What were they brought there for? - A. For me to bury them till he wanted them to print off.

Q. Was any paper brought? - A. Yes.

Q. Who was it brought by? - A. Himself.

Q. And these were in your house at the time you were taken into custody? - A. Yes.

Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You were taken up on the 25th of June? - A. I was.

Q. And there were found in your house two forged plates? - A. Yes.

Q. And you had employed a lad of the name of Bunning to forge others to engrave them? - A. Yes.
