## The Introduction to Sir John Barlycorn's Trial

Gentlemen,

If you please bet give so much attention, and you shall presently hear Sir John Barleycorn called to the bar, and all his accusers appears, giving in their bills against him; and also his Friends, which appear in his behalf, and thereby save his life, after he was condemned to die.

## The Trial of Sir John Barleycorn

Cryer

O yes! O yes! O yes! If any man or woman in country, town, or city, have any suits or bills of indictment, against Sir John Barleycorn, let them appear this day, and they shall either hear or be heard.

Vulcan the Blacksmith appears, and gives in his Bill.

Be it known to you all, Gentleman, that this Sir John Barleycorn hath been a sore enemy to me and many of muy fellows. For many a time, when I have been busy at my work, not thinking of any manner of harm to any man, but having a fire-spark in my throat, and one time going to the sign of the Cup and Can for one pennyworth of ale, there I found Sir John; and thinking no hurt to anyone, I set me down to spend my two-pence; but in the end Sir John began to pick a quarrel with me, and then I started up, thinking to go about my business; but then Sir John had got such fast hold of me by the top of my head, that I had no power of myself; and by his strength and power threw me down, broke my head, and bruised other parts of my purse and left me bever a penny; and therefore he doth deserve to die.

Will the Weaver

Now gentlemen, I do beseech you to hear me speak. I am but a poor man, and have a wife, and a charge of children, and am but a poor Weaver by my trade, yet this unkind companion will never let me alone, but is always enticing me up from my work, and will not be quiet till he hath mwe to the alehouse, and when there he always quarrels with me, and abuses me most basely, and sometimes he binds me both hand and foot, and throws me into a ditch, and there stays with me all night, and next morning leaves me, but with never a penny in my pocket; and therefore, if you hang him I shall never grieve.

The Taylor comes in.

And I shall never be sorry if you either hang, drown, or behead him; for I am sure he has been the greatest enemy to me for many years past, for as I never loved him so I never cared for his company, and I always loved Master Wheat better than Sir John Barleycorn, yet one time as I was coming home from my work I espied Sir John and two or three good fellows quarrelling, I skipped among them thinking to make them good friends; for why, thought I, should neighbours fall out; but as soon as Sir John saw me take my neighbour's part, he straitway began to quarrel with me and gave me such a thump on the teeth that I fell backwards, and all bewrayed me, broke both my elbows and my yardwand. nay, worse than that, the very same day me wife met with him, and he like an ill-conditioned knave, abused her, insomuch that she learned of him some of his mischievous tricks, and came home so drunk, that though she could scarcely stand, she beat my back and sides blue. Nay, she has now got the way so perfect that I am perswaded she will never leave it; and therefore by my consent you shall put him to the same death that many of my enemies have been put to, that is to snap off his head.

Mr Wheatley.

Head him, aye hang him too if you please, you shall have my consent, for I am sure he doth deserve it; for I am certain he doth daily and hourly abuse me. I am sure I have been a man that hath oftentimes been highly esteemed both with Lords, Knights and Squires, and none could please him so well as James Wheatley the baker. But now the case is altered, Sir John Barleycorn is the man that is highly esteemed in every place. I am still but plain James Wheatley, and he is now Sir John Barleycorn in every one's mouth, though he has undone many an honest man in England; for the company of Sir John Barleycorn I can prove it to be true, has sorely caused many a man to waste and consume all that ever he had, and more if he can but get it. Nay, he hath caused many a man to sell house and land, and all that ever he had to maintain riot with Sir John Barleycorn. Nay, when men have done all that ever they can, sold all, spent all, and left nothing, yet the fancy they bear to Sir John Barleycorn makes them to rob and steal for money to maintain themselves in his company. Nay robbing and stealing will not serve sometimes but they will kill and slay, murdering one another for money to keep Sir John Barelycorn company till at last the hangman gets part of them. And this Sir John Barleycorn is the great foundation of all this mischief, and therefore he dereves to lose his head.

Old Noll and Old Nick the Judges.

Well, what answer an you make for yourself, Sir John? You hear the complaints made against you, wherein you are strongly accused, both of felony and murder.

Sir John.

I beseech you genetlemen to let me have the benefit of the law to speak for myself; if it shall please you to hear me I hope I shall clear myself.

You know gentlemen, every man is willing to make his case as good as he can, although he himself is in the fault, and as the old proverb goes, Some had better steal a horse than other look over the hedge; and so it is by me in the present case, but as I am not accused by only one of these persons, but by all of them, so I intend to make answer to them all at once.

These men complain that Sir John Barleycorn hath undone them all which is false, as I doubt not but to make appear.

I confess my name is Sir John Barleycorn, but you never new Barleycorn do any harm, but always good, and has relieved as many poor people as any man, and will do so still, if they do not abuse me and my name, as they have, and still do, and take away my good name from me, and instead of calling me Sir John Barleycorn, they nickname me after my friend and neighbour Malt, and so I came to be abused, and basely belied on; fur it is Mr Malt, if anyone, has done us all this wrong, which they say that I have done.

Mr Malt

Who I, brother John? indeed, but only that thou art my brother, and I love thee well, or I should hit thee one slap on thy teeth, but now time will come when you and I shall meet again.

Gentlemen, as for my own part I will put the matter to the bench. But first I pray you consider with yourselves that all tradesmen should live, and although I, Master Malt, so sometimes make a cup of good liquor, and many men come to taste it, yet the fault is neither in me, nor my brother John. No, no, the fault is in such as these which makes this complaint against us, as I shall make appear to you all.

As in the first place, which of you all can say, but Master Malt can make a cup of good liquor, with the help of a good brewer? And when it is made, it must be sold. the fault is not in the drink or the maker; for I pray which of you all can live without it? But when such as these complain of us, find it to be good, when they have such a greedy mind, that they think they shall never have enough for their money; and so Will overcame Wit, and then they begin to quarrel first with each other, and then they abuse me and my brother Sir John, so that in the end we are forced to take them by the topp of the head, and lay them down fast asleep. Then I pray you judge whether we or they are in the fault.

The Judges.

Truly we cannot see that you are much in fault; however, you must give bail.

1624 London broadside entitled A Pleasant new Ballad. To be sung evening and morn, of the bloody murder of Sir John Barleycorn, 
aka
The Pleasant Ballad of John Barleycorn

Yestreen, I heard a pleasant greeting
A pleasant toy and full of joy, two noblemen were meeting
And as they walked for to sport, upon a summer's day,
Then with another nobleman, they went to make affray

Whose names was Sir John Barleycorn, he dwelt down in a dale,
Who had a kinsman lived nearby, they called him Thomas Good Ale,
Another named Richard Beer, was ready at that time,
Another worthy knight was there, called Sir William White Wine.

Some of them fought in a blackjack, some of them in a can,
But the chiefest in the black pot, like a worthy alderman,
Sir Barleycorn fought in a boule, who won the victory,
And made them all to fume and swear, that Barleycorn should die

Some said kill him, some said drown, some to hang him high
For as many as follow Barleycorn, shall surely beggars die
Then with a plough they ploughed him up, and thus they did devise
To bury him quick within the earth, and swore he should not rise.

With harrows strong they combed him, and burst clods on his head
A joyful banquet then was made, when Barleycorn was dead
He rested still within the earth, till rain from skies did fall
Then he grew up in branches green, which sore amazed them all

And so grew up till midsummer, which made them all afeared,
For he sprouted up on high and got a lovely beard
Then he grew up till St James' tide, his countenance was wan,
For he was grown unto his strength and thus became a man

Then with hooks and sickles keen, into the fields they hied
They cut his legs off at the knees, and made him wounds full wide
Thus bloodily they cut him down from the place where he did stand
And like a thief for treachery, they bound him in a band.

And they took him up again, according to his kind
And packed him up in several stakes, to wither in the wind
And with a pitchfork that was sharp, they rent him to the heart,
And like a thief for treason wide, they bound him in a cart.

And tending him with weapons strong, it's to the town they hied
And straight they mowed him in a mow, and there they let him lie
There he lay groaning by the walls, till all his wounds were sore
And at length they took him up again, and cast him on the floor

They hired two with holly clubs, to beat him at once
And thwacked so on Barleycorn that flesh fell from his bones
And then they took him up again, to fulfill women's mind
They dusted him and sifted him, till he was almost blind

And then they knit him in a sack, which grieved him full sore
And steeped him in a fat, Godwot, for three full days and more
Then they took him up again, and laid him for to dry
They cast him in a chamber floor, and swore that he would die

They rubbed him and stirred him, and still they did him turn
The maltman swore that he would die, his body he would burn
They spitefully took him up again, and threw him on a kill,
And dried him there with fire so hot, and there they wrought their will.

hen they brought him to the mill, and there they burst his bones
The miller swore to murder him, betwixt a pair of stones,
Then they took him up again, and served him worse than that
For with hot scalding liquor store, they washed him in a fat

But not content with this Godwot, they did him mickle harm
With threatening words they promised to beat him into barm
And lying in this danger deep, for fear that he should quarrel,
They took him straight out of the fat, and turned him in a barrel

And then they set a trap to him, een though his death begin
They drew out every drop of blood, whilst any drop would run
Some brought jacks upon their backs, some brought bill and bow
And every man his weapon had, Barleycorn to overthrow

When Sir John Goodale he came with mickle might
Then he took their tongues away, their legs or else their sight
And thus Sir John in each respect, so paid them all their hire
That some lay sleeping by the way, some tumbling in the mire

Some lay groaning by the walls, some in the streets downright,
The best of them did scarcely know, what they had done oernight
All you good wives that brew good ale, God turn from you all teen
But is you put too much liquor in, the Devil put out your een.
