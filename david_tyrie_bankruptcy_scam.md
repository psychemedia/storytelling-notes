# A Singular Case of Fraud?

The story starts, perhaps, or at least I have heard it said, with a bankruptcy.

Norfolk Chronicle - Saturday 15 July 1780

On Wednesday last, at Guildhall, came on to be tried before Earl Mansfield, and a special jury, the long depending and remarkable cause between Mess. John and Benjamin Cooper, plaintiffs, and Robert Crowe, Esq; defendant. It was an issue directed the Court of Chancery, to try the validity of a commission of bankrupt issued by the plaintiffs as petitioning creditors against the defendant, and John Parker, Esq. The points in issue were, "Whether the defendant, and the said Mr. Parker, were in trade or partnarlhip;" and it appeared, in the clearest manner, that they were private gentlemen, never concerned in any business, and that the commission was taken out in order to fix their estates with the debts of one David Tyrie, to the amount of 20,000*l.* the pretended partner in this fraudulent commission. In the course of the evidence it came out, that Tyrie, in combination with the supporters of the commission, had procured two sets of false witnesses, one set to get the commission awarded, and the other to procure a verdict against Mr. Crowe, when its validity was tried in the Court of Common Pleas, on the 25th of June, 1779. This last set of hired witnesses, called the FAMILY COMPACT, attracted the particular notice of the Court, from the very extraordinary circumstances that marked it, viz. That Michael Green, one of those family men, and a material witness for the plaintiffs on the trial in the Court of Common Pleas, having sworn himself an Ipswich contractor, who had bought and sold corn, tin, copper, and pigs, for Mr. Crowe and Mr. Parker, was dressed up for the purpose, with suitable apparel, such as boots, &c. &c. and that those boots were bought for him, and specifically charged in a tavern bill, where he and the rest of his gang dined the day of trial, and that this bill was paid by the plaintiff's attorney. It also came out, that another of those hired witnesses wanted shoes to appear in, and a pair of new shoes was bought for him, and paid for in the same manner. The plaintiffs produced but two witnesses to support their case (most of their hired ones having been previously convicted and indicted for perjury at the Old Bailey); the first, on his own testimony and letter, was, by Lord Mansfield, totally set aside, and the other, his cross examination, having in the most clear and express terms proved the fallacy of the commission, his Lordship, without requiring the defendent to go into his case, or to call a single witness, recommended to the jusry to find a verdict for him; and the jury instantly, without going out of Court, found accordingly, against the commission. The verdict was received with the warmest approbation of the Court, and a respectable audience; and by it a conspiracy of singular fraud and villainy was exposed and defeated.

On Wednesday last, at Guildhall, came on to be tried before Earl Mansheld, and a Special Jury, the long-depending and remarkable cause between Mess. John and Benjamin Cooper, Plaintiffs, and Robert Crowe, Esq. Defendant. It was an issue directed by the Court of Chancery, to try the validity of a Commission of Bankruptcy, issued by the Plaintiffs as petitioning Creditors against the Defendant, and John Parker, Esq. The points in issue were, "Whether the Defendant, and the said Mr. Parker, were in trade or partnership;" and it appeared, in the clearest manner, that they were private Gentlemen, never concerned in any business, and that the Commission was taken out in order to fix their estates, with the debts of one David Tyrie, to the amount of 20,000*l.* the pretended partner in this fraudulent Commission.

This last set of hired witnesses, called, "The Family Compact," attracted the particular-notice of the Court, from the very extraordinary circumstances that marked it, viz.

It also came out, that another of those hired witenesses wanted shoes to appear in, and a pair of new shoes was bought for him, and paid for in the same manner. The Plaintiffs produced but two witnesses to support their case, (most of their hired ones having been previously convicted and indicted for perjury at the Old Bailey;) the first on his own testimony and letter, was, by Lord Mansfield, totally set aside; and the other on his cross examination, having, in the most clear and express terms, proved the falacy of the Commission, his Lordship without requiring the Defendant to go into his case, or to call a single witness, recommended to the Jury to give a verdict for him; and the instantly, without going going out ouf Court, accordingly found against the Commission. The versdtict was received with the warmest approbation of the Court, aud a respectable audience; and by it a conspiracy of singular fraud and villainy was exposed and defeated. The Counsel for the Plaintiffs were, Serjeant Davy, Mr, Dunning, and Mr. Baldwin; for the Defendants, the Attorney-General, Mr, Lee, and Mr. Sylvester.

Ipswich Journal - Saturday 30 October 1779

9. The case of Michael Green, who pleaded guilty on Saturday at the Old-Bailey to an Indictment for wilful and corrupt perjury, is of so horrid and singular a nature, that had not the prisoner acquiesced in all the circumstances of it, as stated by Mr. Howarth, it would not have been credible.— The prisoner at the bar, was a member of a club called the *Family Compact*. This club was instituted to carry on the triple scheme of perjury, rapine, and ruin to the most respectable families. The present matter was a cause at issue in the court of Common Pleas, to try whether a gentleman worth 20,000*l.* was a Trader, so as to make him an object of the bankrupt law. The prisoner on that trial swore he had frequently dealt with this gentleman in Ipswich (where he resided\*) and also in London; that he had been employed by him to sell corn at 9d. per quarter commission; and deposed to other facts of trading. The truth now appears to be, that the gentleman never saw this wretch, and never employed him. The counsel said, that he hoped the bench would require of the prisoner more atonement than a bare confession of his guilt; and as he had shewn so far a sense of it as to save the time of the court by his plea, he trusted he would do benefit to society by a discovery of his accomplices. The prisoner said he was suborned by the assignees and a certain banker, of whom he was to receive 500*l.* if the scheme of drawing in the gentleman as a third partner in the bankruptcy had fully succeeded, and all his effects been secured to the assignees. The court restricted judgment until the next sessions, and exorted the prisoner to make an ample discovery of the other members of the *Family Compact*, which he promised to do, and under that consideration his sentence will be mitigated, provided he does not prevaricate or deceive.

\* Michael Green, about 2 years since, took a shop in St. Nicholas, Ipswich, where he told linen-drapery, &c. but resided here only 3 months, in which time he got a knowledge of Mr. Robert Trotman, a gentleman who has been times subpoena'd in the above trial. Whilst here, his character became suspicious, and his landlord wrote into Yorkshire about him; the answer, amongst other particulars, says that he, (Green) paid his addresses to the daughter of a person of property, and in order to deceive her friends, he collected together a number of pretended tenants; the scheme succeeded— the father thought him a man of fortune, and gave him his daughter, with a gentell portion.

Ipswich Journal - Saturday 18 December 1779

Last week at the sessions at the Old Bailey, the counsel for the prosecution of Michael Green, (late of St. Nicholas parish, Ipswich) who pleaded guilty the last sessioms to an indictment for perjury, and sentence was deferred in order that he might make discovery of the real persons who seduced him, informed the court the said Michael Green had at first charged some respectable characters in the city of London; that he had since declared the same to be false, and he had falsely charged other characters equally respectable; that having prevaricated so much, not the least credit could be given any thing he said; that by such means he had aggravated his offence, and moved for judgment accordingly, whereupon the court ordered him to be put in the pillory, and to be imprisoned 12 monthhs in Newgale. *See B 9, Oct. 30.*

Hibernian Journal; or, Chronicle of Liberty - Monday 13 August 1781

The Account given in some of the Morning Papers, of the remarkable Trial that came on last Saturday in the King's-Bench, Guildhall, before Lord Mansfield, and a Special Jury, not being explicit enough to give the Public a perfect Idea of that curious Business, a Correspondent has sent us the following real State of it, *as taken from the Evidence*.—In September, 1778, a Commission of Bankruptcy was issued out against Robert Crowe, John Parker, and David Tyrie, (Names well known at Westminster Hall, and other Courts of Justice) as being joint Traders, and Partners in a Distillery in Compton street, Clerkenwell, and other trading Business, which was afterwards difcovered to be as *fair* in its Nature, as we hope it is uncommon in its Practice.

Shortly after the issuing out of this Commission, Messrs. Crowe and Parker petitioned the Lord Chancellor to supersede it, upon the Ground that they were not Partners with Mr. Tyrie.—The Chancellor, to try the Merits of this Question, directed an Action to be brought between the Bankrupts and Assignees, which was tried before the late Lord Chief Justice De Grey, and a Verdict given for the Assignees; but on this Trial a Manoeuvre was practised, which was never heard of before, and we hope never will again. The Assignees who had sufficient Evidence to support the Commission, in *Letters written by the Bankrupts themselves*, particularly Crowe, yet their Solicitor was prevailed upon by Tyrie to examine one Green and two others by Way of strengthening their Case. It afterwards appeared, that this Evidence was a gross Scene of Perjury, for which Green was indicted, and *pleaded guilty* at the Old Bailey to the Indictment, and was prevailed upon, by a Promise of Pardon, and a large Reward, to charge the Assignees and the Solicitor with having suborned him. The Business thus *cooked*, Messrs. Crowe and Parker petition the Chancellor a second Time for a new Trial, upon the Ground of this Perjury; the Chancellor of Courfe directed an Issue; and the good Evidence in Support of the Commission *being thus artfully contaminated*, a Verdict went for Mr. Crowe, and thereupon the Commission was superseded.

Upon this Messrs. Crowe and Parker bring their separate Actions for Damages against the Assignees (namely, Mr. Halliday, the Banker; Mr. Cooper, the Builder; and Mr. Daniel, their Solicitor); this is the Action that was tried last Saturday, wherein the Designs and Conduct of the Plaintiffs appeared *in their proper Colours*. As to the perjured Evidence on the former Trial, there could not be one thinking Person among the numerous Audience in Court insensible of the *Source* from whence that Scene of Wickedness sprung, with its Views and Motives, which Lord Mansfield well expressed, by calling it *a Plot within a Plot*. It was likewise wrung out on the Cross-examination of Mr. Vowell, *one of the Plaintiff's own Witnesses*, that they had sent a Ship, called the Mary, commanded by a Captain Snelling to Leghorn, from whence she returned to England with the Manufactures of that Country, to the Value of about 1,400*l.* but which the Plaintiffs, industrioufly got insured for 8000*l.* That on the Arrival of the Ship, they run those Goods into Cornwall, and then wanted the Captain to put back to Sea and sink the Ship, which he, through Fear, declined to do. This Witness further swore, he understood that this Scheme was planned *by the Plaintiff Crowe*.

As to the trading of this worthy Company, and that they knew they were liable to the Operation of the Bankrupt Laws, the following Extracts from Letters *read as Evidence*, and written by the Plaintiff Crowe, will give a sufficient Conviction of that, independent of any other Evidence, though a great Deal could be adduced.

Crowe, in one of his Letters, says, "As for thinking of getting any more done at Lloyd's on the Mary, it is ridiculous for Vowell has just been with me, and says that 15 per Cent. had been offered on her, without Effect, by some of the Underwriters on his Policy, to hedge themfelves off, and that Bruce, his Broker in that Business, told him *they began to look on the Whole as an intended take-in*."  
(Signed) ROBERT CROWE.  
*And directed to Tyrie.*

In another Letter directed to Mr. Henry Papps, one of his confidential Secretaries he says, "My dear Friend, I did intend this Night to have fully and minutely answered your three last Letters, but am obliged, from the well-founded Apprehensions, to sleep out of my Lodgings to Night where your Letters are; and as I do not chuse to go for them, or entrust a Servant with such confidential Instruments, I must defer this full and minute Answer to Saturday's Post. The Delay of Snelling stabs me with the most pointed Anxiety; by God his Infanity and Prize-hunting will undo us. I am ruffled in my Spirits. Adieu,

And be assured I am,  
Your's unalterably,  
(Signed)            ROBERT CROWE."

In another Letter he says, "Mr George Papps, by his Deceptions and false Estimates, has robbed us of a heavy Sum in Compton street, *and I think we are mad if we don't get home on his Friends in Lombard-street*.
(Signed)            ROBERT CROWE."  
And dated Paris, 10th of May 1778

In another Letter to Mr. Vowell, he says, "My dear Sir, Fenton will not hear of any Thing but a Bill at two Months; and as he is a cross hatty old Fellow, I recommend taking him off from the Set that is acting against Tyrie as soon as possible. It is not worth the Hazard of a Moment to keep Things of this Sort unsettled, when a Strike might follow from it, at this critical Period *that would involve us in the Loss of Thousands and other fatal Inconveniencies*, besides a *premature Commission*, and in *adverse* Hands, *before the various Matters are digested and prepared for a Guildhall Scrutiny*, would be an Event that no human Wit could get over. If you concur in this Sentiment, please to accept the enclosed Bill which I will send the Fellow to put an End to this Enmity.  
Your's sincerely,
ROBERT CROWE."  
*Commons Coffee-house Paul's Church yard 10 Clock.*

Upon this *the Jury instantly, and without going out of Court* found a Verdict for the Defendants Mess. Halliday Cooper and Daniel. As to Mr. Tyrie whom Messrs. Crowe and Parker *affected* to make a Defendant, they gave a Verdict against him for 5000*l.* which it is imagined he and Messrs. Crowe and Parker will have no great Difficulty in settling, *to each others Satisfaction*.

The Writer of this refers to every one who was in Court for his Veracity and Moderation in his Statement of the Facts; and as to the foregoing Extracts of Letters the Originals are in the Hands of Mr. Reynolds of the Agency; where they and many others to the same Effect, may be seen by anyone willing to take that trouble.

Two Short-hand Writers having taken down the Trial in Court, it is hoped it will be published for a Safeguard and Caution to the Public at large, particularly the commercial World.

Attorney for the Plaintiff, Mr Vernon, jun.

Counsel, the Attorney General, Mess. Lee, Howarth, Sylvefter, and Hunter.

Attorney for the Defendants, Halliday, Cooper, and Daniel, the above Mr. Reynolds.

Counsel, Mess. Dunning, Davenport, Peckham, Baldwin, and Stackpoole.

Thursday 02 (09) August 1781

Saturday came on to be tried before Lord Mansfield and a Special Jury at Guildhall, London, a Cause wherein Robert Crowe was Plaintiff, and Mess. Halliday, Daniel, and Cooper Defendants. The Action was brought for maliciously suing out and prosecuting a Commission of Bankruptcy against the Plaintiff as a joint Trader with Mess. Parker and Tyrie, when it appeared fully in Evidence, that Mess. Crowe, Parker and Tyrie, were jointly concerned in carrying on various Trades and Merchandizes; that they were credited as Co partners by several of the Witnesses, & were indebted in a very confiderable Sum of Money to the Defendants, who had consulted a Barrister on the Case. In the Management of the whole Affair it plainly appeared that the Defendants had acted with great Honour and Propriety, and were well warranted in their several Proceedings to render themselves and many other injured Creditors Justice. After a very candid and full Examination, the Case being impartially left to the Jury, a Verdict was immediately and moft unanimously found for the Defendants, to the entire Satisfaction of the Court, and a very numerous Audience. Attorney for the Plaintiff, Mr. J. Vernon, junior, Lincoln's Inn; Counsel, the Attorney-General, with Mess. Howarth, Lee, Silvester, and Hunter. Attorney for Defendants, Mr. John Reynolds, Adelphi; Counsel, Mess. Dunning, Davenport, Peckham, Baldwin, and Stackpoole.

This was a Cause of very great importance, in which the Principles and Conduct of the Plaintiff were placed in their Proper Colours, and the Character and Honour of the Defendants confirmed by a most respectable Jury. The like Action brought by Parker shared a fimilar Fate.

From later news reports, it appears that in the meantime he became "a lottery-office keeper... at one time set up for a member of parliament, by standing candidate for the borough of Hindon. He was also frequently employed by the borough-hunters, and other electioneering schemes, in which generally contrived to cheat both parties" ([The Scots Magazine -  August 1782](https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/BL/0000545/17820801/002/0001)) and then "procured himself a place in the navy-office at Portsmouth" ([Caledonian Mercury - Saturday 17 August 1782](https://britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000045/17820817/009/0002)).
