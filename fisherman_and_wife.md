# The Fisherman and His Wife

A Grimm tale, widely told. I'm pretty sure I heard Irish storyteller Eddie Lenihan telling it (it can also be found on his *Storytelling 1 & 2* CD collection).

The first time I told it, I settled on the following verse to summon the fish:

*Little fish, little fish,*  
*Who I saved from the dish,*  
*Little fish, little fish,*  
*Please grant me a wish.*

THE FISHERMAN AND HIS WIFE.

There was once a fisherman who lived with his wife in a ditch, close by the sea-side. The fisherman used to go out all day long a-fishing; and one day, as he sat on the shore with his rod, looking at the shining water and watching his line, all-on a sudden his float was dragged away deep under the sea: and in drawing it up he pulled a great fish out of the water. The fish said to him, "Pray let me live: I am nota real fish; I am an enchanted prince, put me in the water again, and let me go." "Oh!" said the man, "you need not make so many words about the matter; I wish to have nothing to do with a fish that can talk; so swim away as soon as you please." "Then he put him back into the water, and the fish darted straight down to the bottom, and left a long streak of blood behind him.

When the fisherman went home to his wife in the ditch, he told her how he had caught a great fish, and how it had told him it was an enchanted prince, and that on hearing it speak he had let it go again. "Did you not ask it for any thing?" said the wife. " No," said the man,  what should I ask for?" "Ah!" said the wife, "we live very wretchedly here in this nasty stinking ditch; do go back, and tell the fish we want a little cottage."

The fisherman did not much like the business: however, he went to the sea, and when he came there the water looked all yellow and green. And he stood at the water's edge, and said,

"O man of the sea!  
Come listen to me.  
For Alice my wife,  
The plague of my life,  
Hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!"

Then the fish came swimming to him, and said, "Well, what does she want?" " Ah!" answered the fisherman, "my wife says that when I had caught you, I ought to have asked you for something before I let you go again; she does not like living any longer in the ditch, and wants a little cottage." "Go home, then," said the fish, "she is in the cottage already." So the man went home, and saw his wife standing at the door of a cottage. "Come in, come in," said she; "is not this much better than the ditch?" And there was a parlour, and a bed-chamber, and a kitchen; and behind the cottage there was alittle garden with all sorts of flowers and: fruits, and a court-yard full of ducks and chickens. "Ah!" said the fisherman, "how happily we shall live!" "We will try to do so at least," said his wife.

Every thing went right for a week or two, and then Dame Alice said, "Husband, there is not room enough in this cottage, the court-yard and garden are a great deal too small; I should like to have a large stone castle to live m; so go to the fish again, and tell him to give us a. castle." "Wife," said the fisherman, "I don't like to go to him again, for perhaps he will be angry; we ought to be content with the cottage." "Nonsense!" said the wife; "he swill do it very willingly; go along, and try."

The fisherman went; but his heart was very heavy: and when he came to the sea, it looked blue and gloomy, though it was quite calm, and he went close to it, and said,

"O man of the sea!  
Come listen to me,  
For Alice my wife,  
The plague of my life,  
Hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!"

"Well, what does she want now?" said the fish. "Ah!" said the man very sorrowfully, my wife wants to live in a stone castle."  "Go home then," said the fish, "she is standing at the door of it already." So away went the fisherman, and found his wife standing before a great castle. "See," said she, "is not this grand?" With that they went into the castle together, and found a great many servants there, and the rooms all richly furnished and full of golden chairs and tables; and behind the castle was a garden, and a wood half a mile long, full of sheep, and goats, and hares, and deer; and in the court-yard were stables and cow-houses. "Well!" said the man, "now will we live contented and happy in this beautiful castle for the rest of our lives." "Perhaps we may," said the wife; "but let us consider and sleep upon it before we make up our minds:" so they went to bed.

The next morning, when Dame Alice awoke, it was broad day-light, and she jogged the fisherman with her elbow, and said, "Get up, husband, and bestir yourself, for we must be king of all the land." "Wife, wife," said the man, "why should we wish to be king? I will not be king." "Then I will," said Alice.

"But, wife," answered the fisherman, "how can you be king? the fish cannot make you a king." "Husband," said she, "say no more about it, but go and try; I will be king!" So the man went away, quite sorrowful to think that his wife should want to be king. The sea looked a dark grey colour, and was covered with foam as he cried out,

"O man of the sea!  
Come listen to me,  
For Alice my wife,  
The plague of my life,  
Hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!"

"Well, what would she have now ?" said the fish. " Alas!" said the man, " my wife wants to be king." "Go home," said the fish; "she is king already."

Then the fisherman went home; and as he came close to the palace, he saw a troop of soldiers, and heard the sound of drums and trumpets; and when he entered in, he saw his wife sitting on a high throne of gold and diamonds, with a golden crown upon her head; and on each side of her stood six beautiful maidens, each a head taller than the other.

"Well, wife," said the fisherman, "are you king?" "Yes," said she, "I am king." And when he had looked at her for a long time, he said, "Ah, wife! what a fine thing it is to be king! now we shall never have any thing more to wish for." "I don't know how that may be," said she; "never is a long time. I am king, 'tis true, but I begin "to be tired of it, and I think I should like to be emperor." "Alas, wife! why should you wish to be emperor?" said the fisherman. "Husband," said she, "go to the fish; I say I will be emperor." "Ah, wife!" replied the fisherman, "the fish cannot make an emperor, and I should not like to ask for such a thing." "I am king," said Alice, and you are my slave, so go directly!" So the fisherman was obliged to go; and he muttered as he went along, "This will come to no good, it is too much to ask, the fish will be tired at last, and then we shall repent of what we have done." He soon arrived at the sea, and the water was quite black and muddy, and a mighty whirlwind blew over it; but he went to the shore and said,

"O man of the sea!  
Come listen to me,  
For Alice my wife,  
The plague of my life,  
Hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!"

"What would she have now?" said the fish, "Ah!" said the fisherman, "she wants to be emperor." "Go home," said the fish; "she is emperor already." Go he went home again; and as he came near he saw his wife sitting on a very lofty throne made of solid gold, with s great crown on her head full two yards high, and on each side of her stood her guards and attendants in a row, each one smaller than the other, from the tallest giant down to a little dwarf no bigger than my finger. And before her stood princes, and dukes, and earls: and the fisherman went up to her and said, "Wife, are you emperor?" "Yes," said she, "I am emperor." "Ah!" said the man as he gazed upon her, "what a fine thing it is to be emperor!" "Husband," said she, "why should we stay at being emperor? I will be pope next." "Oh wife, wife!" said he, "how can you be pope? there is but one pope at a time in Christendom." "Husband," said she, "I will be pope this very day." "But," replied the husband, "the fish cannot make you pope." "What nonsense!" said " she, "if he can make an emperor, he can make a pope; go and try him." So the fisherman went. But when he came to the shore the wind was raging, and the sea was tossed up and down like boiling water, and the ships were in the greatest distress and danced upon the waves most fearfully; in the middle of the sky there was alittle blue, but towards the south it was all red as if a dreadful storm was rising. At this the fisherman was terribly frightened and trembled, so that his knees knocked together: but he went to the shore and said,

"O man of the sea!  
Come listen to me,  
For Alice my wife,  
The plague of my life,  
Hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!"

"What does she want now?" said the fish. "Ah!" said the fisherman, "my wife wants to be pope." "Go home," said the fish, "she is pope already."

Then the fisherman went home; and found his wife sitting on a throne that was two miles high; and she had three great crowns on her head, and around stood all the pomp and power of the church; and on each side were two rows of burning lights, of all sizes, the greatest as large as the highest and biggest tower in the world, and the least no larger than a small rushlight. "Wife," said the fisherman as he looked at all this grandeur, "are you pope?" "Yes," said she, "I am pope." "Well, wife," replied he, "it is a grand thing to be pope; and now you must be content, for you can be nothing greater." "I will consider of that," said the wife. "Then. they went to bed: but Dame Alice could not sleep all night for thinking what she should be next. At last morning came, and the sun rose. "Ha!" thought she as she looked at it through the window, "cannot I prevent the sun rising?" At this she was very angry, and wakened her husband, and said; " Husband, go to the fish and tell him I want to be Lord of the sun and moon." The fisherman was half asleep, but the thought frightened him so much, that he started and fell out of bed. "Alas, wife!" said he, "cannot you be content to be pope?" "No," said she, "I am very uneasy, and cannot bear to see the sun and moon rise without my leave. Go to the fish directly."

Then the man went trembling for fear; and as he was going down to the shore a dreadful storm arose, so that the trees and the rocks shook; and the heavens became black, and the lightning played, and the thunder rolled; and you might have seen in the sea great black waves like mountains with a white crown of foam upon them; and the fisherman said,

"O man of the sea!  
Come listen to me,  
For Alice my wife,  
The plague of my life,  
Hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!"

"What does she want now?" said the fish. "Ah!" said he, "she wants to be lord of sun and moon." "Go home," said the fish, "to your ditch again!" And there they live to this very day.

Notes, p. 221:

> The Fisherman and his Wife, p. 27.—"De Fischer un siine Fru," a story in the Pomeranian Low German dialect, admirably adapted to this species of narrative, and particularly pleasing to an English ear, as bearing a remarkable affinity to his own language, or rather that of the Lowland Scotch. Take the second sentence as a specimen: "Daar satt he eens an de see, bi de angel, un sach in dat blanke water, un he sach immer (ever) na de angel," &c. During the fervour of popular feeling on the downfall of the power of the late Emperor of France, this tale became a great favourite. In the original the last object of the wife's desires is to be as "de lewe Gott" (der liebe Gott, le bon Dieu). We have softened the boldness of the lady's ambition.

Several variants of the tale can be found in the Irish Schools collection ([example 1](https://www.duchas.ie/en/cbes/4428060/4373687/4477316?), [example 2](https://www.duchas.ie/en/cbes/5044750/5036201/5137396), [example 3](https://www.duchas.ie/en/cbes/4428051/4372483/4471409), [example 4](https://www.duchas.ie/en/cbes/4770035/4768271/4815515), [example 5](https://www.duchas.ie/en/cbes/4922386/4876513/5082865)).

A Scottish version also exists on the [Tobar an Dualchais](https://www.tobarandualchais.co.uk/) website, collected from Stanley Robertson, in Aberdeen, in 1979: [*A woman was granted her wishes but ended up where she started as a result of her discontent.*](https://www.tobarandualchais.co.uk/track/65001?l=en):

> Stanley Robertson introduces a story that he calls 'The Owld Wuman that Lived in a Vinegar Bottle', which he learned from his mother.
>
> A bad-tempered old woman lived in a vinegar bottle and hated it. Her husband, a fisherman, caught a big fish, which turned out to be the Old Man of the Sea. In return for his freedom, he promised to grant whatever the man and his wife wanted. The wife demanded a castle, the fishermen called in rhyme for the Old Man of the Sea, and the wish was granted. The wife was only contented for a short time, and kept demanding different dwellings. The Old Man lost patience and she found herself back in the vinegar bottle. She continued treating her husband badly, and he lived unhappily ever after.

This is a tale I'll remember that a fairy tale tried.

The old woman that loved in a vinegar bottle.

In sappoinac time, her loved an old woman and she bared in a vinegar bottle.

And she was most unhappy in her vinegar bottle.

Her mind was a fisherman and they didn't hate her very much.

And aw, she hated biting the vinegar bottle.

She says, "Lama, look at this scabby vinegar bottle.

The neighbors could look in to see it anytime because it's made of glass.

But then they hear her cottons.

A skull in the winter.

No, I'm not happy.

And you go out and do your best and see if you can get something for wassaka."

And she melted some fat in the pan and she was like, "Tartre, oh yes."

She was melting this fat in the pan.

And she said, "Don't come back empty-handed."

And her name was Alice.

So the poor man can see this fashion.

And this is fashion.

"He got you some pickest fess you ever did see.

But does he take this to be fair?"

He says, "Well, Alice will be pleased with this fess.

He takes us.

We hope good to fess his mood."

But does he face she was an enchanted fess?"

And he says, "Oh, didn't it kill me.

I'm near fess.

I'm the old man of the sea.

So I only come up here for the holiday."

He says, "You're the old man of the sea."

She said, "But I can't hang him for the fess."

He says, "Look," he says, "I can grant you only a wish because I'm the old man of the sea.

And if you go home and tell your wife she can have anything she wants and the only time you want anything, just come back.

I'll be grateful, but please put me back to the man."

Be nice off here if you can.

I'll fix the old man as he throws him back into the water.

And simply his wife, very excited, and she was eating it.

"And what I fess."

And he comes down and he says, "All right," he says, "I found the biggest and the bunniest looking fess you ever seen.

But Alice, it I was."

And she says, full of the fame when she takes her thing out of Austin Fess and pulls her dirty seat.

And she was a real coarse wife, the poor man's rather than a woman of the other's.

But he says, "Oh, but he says, "Oh," and she's hacked him with that spine because he never did talk about it.

And she says, "But this was a magic fess and promised me that I can get your wishes."

And she kicks him and she says, "Well, go back," she says, "I'm sick and tired living in a vinegar bottle.

Go back and tell that old man of the sea if he's real."

And I went to bed in a beautiful castle.

I go into the living of vinegar bottle.

And if you've got that, then you could come home."

So, gangster the old man of the sea and he says, "Old man of the sea, come listen to me.

For Alice, my wife, the plague of my life, has sent me to beg a boon of thee."

To the Buddha of France he says, "What do you want?"

And you request your be grande?

In case she wants to make a bid in vinegar bottle, she wants to have a beautiful castle.

He says, "Go home to your wife and when you go home, you'll find you're living in a castle."

He says, "A beautiful castle," said Nunezus.

And his wife presented, "Oh, she's delighted."

She says, "Old man of the sea's given me the castle."

She's got a serb and some horses with all the trimmings.

She presented the castle a little bit a week and she said, "I don't like this castle.

It's too cold and too droughty.

People shouldn't live in big, stolen houses like this.

I don't have a idea.

It's too lonely and cold and droughty.

Tell me when a nice summer cottage is flowing around the booty."

The blue man in the back says, "Old man of the sea come listen to me."

For I ask my wife the plague of my life has sent me the beg of unity.

She says, "What do you want?"

And you request, "We'll be granted."

He says, "Oh, she wants to buy you a little country cottage with flowers."

He says, "Well, go back and you'll find you're writing this place with the flowers."

The games back, you know, the wife delighted for a few minutes.

"Oh, but the next day she's a grandmother."

She says, "Look at this.

Look what I've got.

I'm really mad.

This is not the kind of garden we do.

This cottage is not big enough for two of us.

It's not a good cottage.

I don't like it.

I don't like the smell of that flower.

So I'm not good.

Oh, there was nothing pleased her."

She said, "Tell him I went to go and stay in a trailer."

Like a caravan thing.

She says, "My wife wants to go into one of these great big, long, long trail of things, a caravan style thing, and a big, long one.

The romantic, gypsy style.

She wants to be, looks like a behemoth, though."

So she comes in.

She says, "Oh, no, no, no."

She says, "I can't look like these tinker people."

"Oh, no, I've never meant to be a gypsy.

This is no use.

This is what some of the cottage was.

I don't like cooking over this kind of stove.

Oh, nothing pleased her.

Go back and tell him I went to Paulus."

Bach, he goes again, and he's riding to the old land of the sea.

The old man I see once more says, "Go back, and your wife will get her Paulus."

"Well, tried her isn't it, Paulus?"

And she was tired.

It was too big, too eerie.

Everything was her fault in it.

Well, she had Paulus, she had Chatea, she had cottage, she had tenements, she had masonettes, she had trains, she had up and up possible dwelling places that you could think of, and nothing pleased her.

So finally, she says, "Go to the old man."

She says, "I want something that I like best of all, something that I could really look comfortable in.

I don't want the skin of houses and that kind of houses.

I want something to look very, very comfortable."

So Bach goes to the old man, and he says, "Old man of the sea come listen to me."

"For I lost my wife, the plague of my wife has sent me to beg of lunadie."

And the old man says, "Well, well," he says, "I've never been so sconered with that woman of yours."

She says, "She's an absolute plague."

He says, "Maybe I'd better have a teen hair and neck."

And he says, "This is worse than having her wishes."

He says, "Look, this is her last wish she gets me.

I'm sorry.

I've run into patients.

They get no more than that.

This is your luck.

Go home to your wife and she'll be very happy and contented."

And the man came home, and his wife was living back in her vinegar bottle.

And all she was complaining, and she was cooking this thing I rostened for her.

And the poor man came in, she sculled him with this thing I rostened for her again.

And the poor man lived most unhappily ever after.

I rostened stury up, isn't it?

I anodic stury.

Oh, that's true.

For the rottened, we have rottened up.

Now, I know the international version of it, but this certainly has been taken up well by the travelers.
