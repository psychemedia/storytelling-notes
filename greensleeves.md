GREENSLEEVES

From *A Handefull of Pleasant Delites, &c.*, London, 1684, as reprinted in Park's *Heliconia*, voL ii. p. 23. It is there entitled *A New Courtly Sonet of the Lady Greensleeves. To the new Tune of Greensleeves.*

"The earliest mention of the ballad of *Green Sleeves*, in the Registers of the Stationers' Company, is in September, 1580, when Richard Jones had licensed to him *A New Northern Dittye of the Lady Green Sleeves*."

"*Green Sleeves*, or *Which nobody can deny*, has been a favorite tune from the time of Elizabeth to the present day, and is still frequently to be heard in the streets of London to songs with the old burden, *Which nobody can deny*. It will also be recognized as the air of *Christmas comes but once a year*, and many another merry ditty." Chappell's *Popular Music of the Olden Time*, p. 227.

*Greensleeves* is twice alluded to by Shakespeare in *The Merry Wives of Windsor*; Act ii. Sc. 1; Act v. Sc. 5.

Alas, my love, ye do me wrong  
To cast me oft discurteously,  
And I have loved you so long,  
Delighting in your companie.  
*Greensleeves was all my joy,*
*Greensleeves was my delight.*
*Greensleeves was my heart of gold.*  
*And who but Ladie Greensleeves.*

I have been readie at your hand  
To grant what ever you would crave;  
I have both waged life and land,  
Your love and good will for to have.  
*Greensleeves was all my joy, &c.*

I bought thee kerchers to thy head  
That were wrought fine and gallantly;  
I kept thee both at boord and bed,  
Which cost my purse well favouredly.  
*Greensleeves was all my joy, &c.*

I bought thee peticotes of the best,  
The cloth so fine as fine might be;  
I gave thee jewels for thy chest.  
And all this cost I spent on thee.
*Greensleeves was all my joy, &c.*

Thy smock of silke, both faire and white,  
With gold embrodered gorgeously.  
Thy peticote of sendall right.  
And this I bought thee gladly.
*Greensleeves was all my joy, &c.*

Thy girdle of gold so red,  
With pearles bedecked sumtuously,
The like no other lasses had, —  
And jet thou wouldest not love me.
*Greensleeves was all my joy, &c.*

Thy purse, and eke thy gay guilt knives,  
Thy pineaae, gallant to the eie,—  
No better wore the burgesse wives, —  
And yet thou wouldst not love me.
*Greensleeves was all my joy, &c.*

Thy crimson stockings, all of silk.  
With golde all wrought above the knee  
Thy pumps, as white as was the milk,  
And yet thou wouldst not love me.
*Greensleeves was all my joy, &c.*

Thy gown was of the grassie green,  
Thy sleeves of satten hanging by.  
Which made thee be our harvest queen,  
And yet thou wouldat not love me.  
*Greensleeves was all my joy, &c.*

Thy garters fringed with the golde,  
And silver aglets hanging by.  
Which made thee blithe for to beholde,—  
And yet thou wouldst not love me.
*Greensleeves was all my joy, &c.*

My gayest gelding I thee gave,  
To ride where ever liked thee.  
No ladie ever was so brave,  
And yet thou wouldst not love me.  
*Greensleeves was all my joy, &c.*

My men were clothed all in green,  
And they did ever wait on thee;  
All this was gallant to be seen,  
And yet thou wouldst not love me.
*Greensleeves was all my joy, &c.*

They set thee up, they took thee downe,  
They served thee with humilitie;  
Thy foote might not once touch the ground.  
And yet thou wouldst not love me.
*Greensleeves was all my joy, &c.*

For everie morning, when thou rose,  
I sent thee dainties, orderly,  
To cheare thy stomach from all woes,  
And yet thou wouldst not love me.
*Greensleeves was all my joy, &c.*

Thou couldst desire no earthly thing  
But stil thou hadst it readily;  
Thy musicke still to play and sing,  
And yet thou wouldst not love me.
*Greensleeves was all my joy, &c.*

And who did pay for all this geare,  
That thou didst spend when pleased thee?  
Even I that am rejected here,  
And thoa disdainst to love me.
*Greensleeves was all my joy, &c.*

Wel, I wil pray to God on hie  
That thou my constancie maist see,  
And that yet once before I die  
Thou will vouchsafe to love me.
*Greensleeves was all my joy, &c.*

Greensleeves, now farewel, adue!  
God I pray to prosper thee.  
For I am stil thy lover true;  
Come once againe, and love me!
*Greensleeves was all my joy, &c.*
