Story:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_the_Rhymer

O true Thomas he lay on a Huntly bank  
Beneath an Eilton tree  
O when he saw a lady fair  
Comin ridin oer the lea

O her mantle it was of the forest green  
And her tresses they were so fair  
And from every tass of her horse's mane  
Hung twenty siller bells and mair

O Thomas he doffed off his hat  
He got down upon his knee  
He said - Lady you're the greatest queen  
That ever I did see

O no O no O Thomas - she said  
That name does not belong to me  
For I have come from Elfinland  
I have come to visit thee

And you maun come O Thomas - she said  
You maun come along wi me  
For I am bound for Elfinland  
It is very far away

So they rode and they rode and they merrily merrily rode  
O merrily they rode away  
Until they came to a crystal river  
That lay across their way

What river is this? O Thomas he said  
O please to me do say  
This is a river of tears - she said  
That is spilled on this earth in one day

So they rode and they rode and they merrily merrily rode  
They rode for a night and a day  
Until they came to a red river  
That lay across their way

What river is this? O Thomas he said  
O please to me do say  
This is a river of blood - she said  
That is spilled on this earth in one day

So they rode and they rode and they merrily merrily rode  
O merrily they rode away  
Until they came to a thorny road  
That lay across their way

What road is that? O Thomas he said  
O please to me do tell  
That is a road you must never lead  
For that road it leads to hell

So they rode and they rode and they merrily merrily rode  
Merrily they rode away  
Until they came to a great orchard  
That lay across their way

Lie down, lie down O Thomas - he cried  
O it's hungry that I maun be  
Lie down, lie down O Thomas he cried  
Some fine apples I do see

O touch them not - the Elfin queen said  
Please touch them not I say  
For they are made from the curses  
That fall on this earth in one day

Then reachin up into a tree  
Into a tree so high  
She plucked an apple from a tree  
As they went riding by

O eat you this O Thomas - she said  
As we go riding by  
And it will give to you a tongue  
You shall never tell a lie

So they rode and they rode and they merrily merrily rode  
O they rode for a year and a day  
Until they came to a great valley  
That lay across their way

What place is this? O Thomas he said  
O please to me do say  
O this is Elfinland - she said  
And it's here that you maun stay

So Thomas got a coat of lovely brown  
And some shoes of elfin green  
And for seven long years and a day  
On earth he was never seen

THOMAS THE RHYMER.
IN THREE PARTS.

Few personages are so renowned in tradition as Thomas of Erceldoune, known by the appellation of The Rhymer. Uniting, or supposed to unite, in his person, the powers of poetical composition, and of vaticination, his memory, even after the lapse of five hundred years, is regarded with veneration by his countrymen. To give any thing like a certain history of this remarkable man, would be indeed difficult; but the curious may derive some satisfaction from the particulars here brought together.

It is agreed, on all hands, that the residence, and probably the birth place, of this ancient bard, Wjas Erceldoune, a village situated upon the Leader, two miles above its junction with the Tweed. The ruins of an ancient tower are still pointed out as the Rhymer's castle. The uniform tradition bears, that hissirnamc was Lermont, or

liteAilMoNT; and that the appellation of The Hhymcr M'as conferred on him in consequence of his poetical compositions. There remains, nevertheless, some doubt upon this subject. In a charter, which is subjoined at length *, the son of our poet designs himself "Thomas of Ercildoun, son and heir of Thomas Rymouu of Ercildoun," which seems to imply, that the father did not bear the hereditary name of Learmont; or, at least, was better known and distinguished by the epithet which he had acquired by his personal accomplishments. I must however remark, that, down to a very late period, the practice of distinguishing the parties, even in formal writings, by the epithets which had been bestowed on thena from personal circumstances, instead of the proper sir-

names of their families, was common, and indeed necessary, among the border clans. So early as the end of the thirteenth century, when sirnames were hardly introduced in Scotland, this custom must have been universal. There is, therefore, nothing inconsistent in supposing our poet's name to have been actually Learmont, although, in this charter, he is distinguished by the popular appellation of The Rhymer.
Wc are better able to ascertain the period at which Thomas of Erceldoune lived; being the latter end of the thirteenth century. I am inclined to place his death a little farther back than MrPiNKERTON, who supposes that he was alive in 1300 (hist of Scotish Poets J; which is hardly, I think, consistent with the charter already quoted, by which his son, in 129.9> for himself and his heirs, conveys to the convent of the Trinity of Soltre, the tenement which he possessed by inheritance (hereditarie) in Ercildoun, with all claim which he, or his predecessors, could preteud thereto. From this we may infer that the Rhymer was now dead; since we find his son disposing of the family property. Still, however, the argument of the learned historian will remain unimpeached, as to the time of the poet's birth. For if, as we learn from Barbour, his prophecies were held in reputation * as early as
* The lines alliidcci to are these:
I hope that Tomas's pro])hesie, Of Eiceldoun, shall truly be in him, &c.

247
1306, when Bruce slew the Red Cummin, the sanctity, ami (let me add to Mr Pinkerton's words) the uncertainty, of antiquity, must have already involved his character and writings. In a charter of Peter de Haga de Bemersyde, which unfortunately wants a date, the Rhymer, a near neighbour, and, if we may trust tradition, a friend of the family, appears as a witness. Cartulary of Melrose.

It cannot be doubted, that Thomas of Erceldoune was a remarkable and important person in his own time, since, very shortly after his death, we find him celebrated as a prophet, and as a poet. Whether he himself made any pretensions to the first of these characters, or whether it was gratuitously conferred upon him by the credulity of posterity, it seems difficult to decide. If we may believe Mackenzie, Lea kmont only versified the prophecies delivered by Eliza, an inspired nun, of a convent at Haddington. But of this there seems not to be the most distant proof. On the contrary, all ancient authors, who quote the Rhymer's prophecies, uniformly suppose them to have been emitted by himself. Thus, in Wintown's Chronicle.,
Of this fycht quiluni spak Thomas
Of Eisyldoune, that suyd in Dernc,
Thure suki mt-it stalwaitly, starke, and sterne.
He sayd it in his prophecy j
But how he wyst it was fer/y.
Book eight, chap. 32.

There could have been noferly (marvel), in Wintowk's eyes at least, how Thomas came by his knowledge of future events, had he ever heard of the inspired nun of Haddington; which, it cannot be doubted, would have been a solution of the mystery, much to the taste of the Prior of Lochlevin.

Whatever doubts, however, the learned might have, as to the source of the Rhymer's prophetic skill, the vulgar had no hesitation to ascribe the whole to the intercourse between the bard and the Queen of Fairy. The popular tale bears, that Thomas was carried off, at an early age, to the Fairy Land, where he acquired all the knowledge which made him afterwards so famous. After seven years residence he was permitted to return to the earth, to enlighten and astonish his countrymen by his prophetic powers; still, however, remaining bound to return to his
Henry, the minstrel, who introduces Thomas into the history of Wallace, expresses the same doubt as to the source of his prophetic knowledge.

Thomas Rhymer into the Faile was than  
With the minister, which was a worthy man.
He used oft to that religious pl::ce;
Tlie people deemed of wit he nieikle ran,
And so he told, though that they bless or ban.
Which happened sooth in inany divers case j
I cannot say by wrong or righteousness.
In rule of war whether they tint or wan:
It may be deemed by division of grace, &c.

royal mistress, when she should intimate her pleasure. Accordingly, while Thomas was making merry with his friends in the tower of Erceldoune, a person came running in, and told, with marks of fear and astonishment, that a hart and hind had left the neighbouring forest, and were, composedly and slowly, parading the street of the village. The prophet instantly arose, left his habitation, and followed the wonderful animals to the forest, whence he was never seen to return. According to the popular belief, he still "drees his weird" in Fairy Land, and is one day expected to revisit earth. In the mean while, his rnemory is held in the most profound respect. The Eildon Tree, from beneath the shade of which he delivered his prophecies, now no longer exists; but the spot is marked by a large stone, called Eildon Tree Stone. A neighbouring rivulet takes the name of the Bogle Burn, (Goblin Brook) from the Rhymer's supernatural visitants. The veneration, paid to his dwelling place, even attached itself in some degree to a person, who, within the memory of man, chose to set up his residence in the ruins of Learmo"nt's tower. The name of this man was Murray; a kind of herbalist, who, by dint of some knowledge in simples, the possession of a musical clock, an electrical machine, and a stuffed alligator, added to a supposed communication with Thomas the Rhymer -, lived for many years in very good credit as a wi//;ard.
* See the dissertation on fairies, prefixed to Tamlan:, p. zj<).

It seemed to the editor unpardonable to dismiss a person so important in border tradition as the Rhymer, without some farther notice than a simple commentary upon the following ballad. It is given from a copy obtained from a lady, residing not far from Ercddoune, corrected and enlarged by one in Mrs Brown's MS. The former copy, however, as might be expected, is far more minute as to local description. To this old tale the editor has ventured to add a second part, consisting of a kind of Cento, from the printed prophecies vulgarly ascribed to the Rhymer; and a third part, entirely modern, founded upon the tradition of his having returned, with the hart and hind, to the Land of Faery. To make his peace with the more severe antiquaries, the editor has prefixed to the second part some remarks on Learmont's prophecies.

PART FIRST.
ANCIENT NEVER BEFORE PUBLISHED.
True Thomas lay on Huntlie bank:  
A ferlie he spied wi' his ee;  
And there he saw a lady bright.  
Come riding down by the Eildon Tree.  
Her shirt was o' the grass green silk.  
Her mantle o' the velvet tyne;  
At ilka tett of her horse's mane,  
Hang fifty siller bells and ni

True Thomas, he pull'd aff his cap.  
And louted low down to his knee  
"All hail, thou mighty Queen of Heav'n?  
For thy peer on earth I never did see."
"O no, O no, Thomas," she said;
"That name does not belang to me;  
I am but the Queen of fair Elfland,  
That am hither come to visit thee.  
"Harp and carp, Thomas," she said;  
"Harp and carp along wi' me:  
And if ye dare to kiss my lips.  
Sure of your bodie I will be."  
"Betide me weal, betide me woe.  
That weird shall never danton me."  
Syne he has kissed her rosy lips.  
All underneath the Eildon Tree.  
"Now, ye maun go wi' me," she said;  
"True Thomas, ye maun go wi' me:  
And yc maun serve me seven years.  
Thro' weal or woe as may chance to be."

She mounted on her milk-white steed;  
She's ta'en true Thomas up behind;  
And aye, whene'er her bridle rung.  
The steed flew swifter than the wind.  
O they rade on, and further on;  
The steed gaed swifter than the wind;  
Untill they reached a desart wide.  
And livina: land was left behind.  
"Light down, light down, now, true Thomas,  
And lean your head upon my knee:  
Abide and rest a little space,  
And I will shew you ferlies three.  
"O see ye not yon narrow road.  
So thick beset wi' thorns and briers?  
That is the path of righteousness,  
Tho' after it but few enquires.  
"And see not ye that braid braid road.  
That lies across that lily levcn?  
That is tlie path of w ickedness,  
Tho' some call it the road to heaven.  

254
"And see not ye that bonny road.  
That winds about the fernie brae?  
That is the road to fair Elfland,  
Where thou and 1 this night maun gae.  
"But, Thomas, ye maun hold your tongue.  
Whatever ye may hear or see;  
For, if you speak word in Elflyn land,  
Ye'll ne'er get back to your ain countrie."-  
O they rade on, and farther on.  
And they waded thro' rivers aboon the knee;  
And they saw neither sun nor moon.
But they heard the roaring of the sea.  
It was mirk mirk night,  
and there was nae stern light,  
And they waded thro' red blude to the knee;  
For a' the blude that's shed on earth,  
Rins thro' the springs o' that countrie.  
Syne they came on to a garden green.  
And she pu'd an apple frae a tree  
"Take this for thy wages, true Thomas;  
It will give the tongue that can never lie."

—"My tongue is mine ain," true Thomas said;  
"A gudely gift ye wad gie to me I  
I neither dought to buy nor sell.  
At fair or tryst where I may be.  
"I dought neither speak to prince or peer.  
Nor ask of grace from fair ladye."  
"Now hold thy peace!" the lady said,  
"For, as I say, so must it be."  
He has gotten a cloth of the even cloth.  
And a pair of shoes of velvet green;  
And, till seven years were gane and past.  
True Thomas on earth was never seen.

NOTE

THOMAS THE RHYMER.
PART FIRST.
She pu'd an apple frae a tree. P. 254, Verse 5.
The traditional commentary upon this ballad informs us, that the apple was the produce of the fatal Tree of Knowledge, and that the garden was the terrestrial paradise. The repugnance of Thomas to be debarred the use of falsehood, when he should find it convenient, has a comic effect.
