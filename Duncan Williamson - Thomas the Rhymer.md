https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_the_Rhymer

O true Thomas he lay on a Huntly bank  
Beneath an Eilton tree  
O when he saw a lady fair  
Comin ridin oer the lea

O her mantle it was of the forest green  
And her tresses they were so fair  
And from every tass of her horse's mane  
Hung twenty siller bells and mair

O Thomas he doffed off his hat  
He got down upon his knee  
He said - Lady you're the greatest queen  
That ever I did see

O no O no O Thomas - she said  
That name does not belong to me  
For I have come from Elfinland  
I have come to visit thee

And you maun come O Thomas - she said  
You maun come along wi me  
For I am bound for Elfinland  
It is very far away

So they rode and they rode and they merrily merrily rode  
O merrily they rode away  
Until they came to a crystal river  
That lay across their way

What river is this? O Thomas he said  
O please to me do say  
This is a river of tears - she said  
That is spilled on this earth in one day

So they rode and they rode and they merrily merrily rode  
They rode for a night and a day  
Until they came to a red river  
That lay across their way

What river is this? O Thomas he said  
O please to me do say  
This is a river of blood - she said  
That is spilled on this earth in one day

So they rode and they rode and they merrily merrily rode  
O merrily they rode away  
Until they came to a thorny road  
That lay across their way

What road is that? O Thomas he said  
O please to me do tell  
That is a road you must never lead  
For that road it leads to hell

So they rode and they rode and they merrily merrily rode  
Merrily they rode away  
Until they came to a great orchard  
That lay across their way

Lie down, lie down O Thomas - he cried  
O it's hungry that I maun be  
Lie down, lie down O Thomas he cried  
Some fine apples I do see

O touch them not - the Elfin queen said  
Please touch them not I say  
For they are made from the curses  
That fall on this earth in one day

Then reachin up into a tree  
Into a tree so high  
She plucked an apple from a tree  
As they went riding by

O eat you this O Thomas - she said  
As we go riding by  
And it will give to you a tongue  
You shall never tell a lie

So they rode and they rode and they merrily merrily rode  
O they rode for a year and a day  
Until they came to a great valley  
That lay across their way

What place is this? O Thomas he said  
O please to me do say  
O this is Elfinland - she said  
And it's here that you maun stay

So Thomas got a coat of lovely brown  
And some shoes of elfin green  
And for seven long years and a day  
On earth he was never seen
