?? Start with the girl?? Or the boy (need a tale to bring him in? Default is the Wolf... ?? a link to Little Red Riding Hood?)


ONCE upon a time, there was a great lord, a Count, who everyone called "the Wolf". He had such a wicked heart, that it was whispered he used to harness his peasants to the plough, and whip them as they tilled his land in their bare naked feet.

But his wife, the Countess? Well, she was as tender to the poor and miserable as he was cruel.

Every time she heard of another of her husband's misdees, she would secretly go to repair the harm he had done; and her name was blessed throughout the whole country-side. She was welcomed, as much as he was avoided. She was loved, as much as he was hated.

II

One day, as the Wolf was out hunting in the forest, he came across a cottage. Outside, a young girl was playing.

"What is your name ? " he asked her.

And she told him. "Renelde, sir".

" You must be tired of living in such a run down place all by yourself ? " he said.

" I am accustomed to it, my lord, and I am not alone. My grandmother looks after me."

" That may be so ; but come to the castle, and you will be my wife's maid."

But before she could respond, her grandmother had come to the door of the cottage, and shouted at the Wolf: " get away from here, you know you're not welcome. You just leave her alone". And he rode away.

Several years later, the Wolf again passed by.

Renelde was by now turning into a pretty young woman, and as she gathering eggs from the hens that were pecking around the small yard, the Wolf asked her: " What is your name ?"

And she told him.

" You must be tired of living in such a run down place ? " he said.

" I am accustomed to it, my lord, but I am happy here, with my grandmother."

" That may be so ; but come to the castle, and you shall be my wife's lady-in-waiting."

But Renelde knew the stories, and she knew better than to go up to the castle.

A few months had passed by when the Wolf next returned. Renelde, now a beautiful young woman, was sitting outside the cottage, spinning hemp.

" You are Renelde," he said. "Come up to the castle, and I shall send send away my wife and marry you."

But many years before, as Renelde's mother lay dying, the Countess had been kind to her, and helped to take away some of her pain. So even if the Wolf really had wished to marry Renelde, she would always have refused.

III

It may only have been weeks that had passed by before Burchard appeared again, but they had been happy weeks. And this time, she was spinning flax, not hemp.

" What are you spinning ? " asked the Wolf, in a rough voice.

" My wedding shift, my lord."

" You are going to be married, then ? "

" Yes, my lord, by your leave."

For at that time, if there was no father in the house, the permission to marry must come from the lord.

" I will give you leave on one condition. The churchyard is filled with nettles that grow over all the tombs  ? Go and gather them, and spin them into two fine shifts. One shall be your bridal shift, and the other shall be my shroud. For you shall be married the day that I am laid in my grave.' And the Count turned away with a mocking laugh.

Renelde trembled. Never had she heard of any one spinning nettles. And the Count? Well, he was a strong man, a ma who seemed to be made of iron, and who oftend boasted that he would live to be a hundred.

She went back into the cottage, sobbing, crying. Through her tears, she blurted out what the Wolf had demanded she should do.

Renelde's grandmother said: "It is many years since I have heard of anyong spinning nettles... but it used to be done once, and so I am sure it can be done again. "

And sat next to her, an old, old woman, older than the hills, who had known the girl's grandmother's grandmother, and her grandmother before her. She would often visit Renelde's grandmother, sitting in the shadows, or later in the day, in the flickering candlelight, as if she were waiting, nodding her head and rarely saying a word. But how she spoke:

" He is foolish to make such a bargain."

That evening, Renelde's young man came to visit, as he did every evening. When Renelde told him what Burchard had said, he was angry, and asked what he should do: " Would you like me to watch for the Wolf, and split his skull with a blow from my axe ? "

"No," replied Renelde, " there must be no blood shed over my bridal gown. And I have told you how good the Countess was to my mother."

IV

And so Renelde went to pick the nettles from the Churchyard, as the Count had said she must; and to her great surprise the nettles, when crushed and prepared, they gave a good thread: soft, and light, and firm.

And before very long she had spun enough thread to make cloth for the first shift, the shift for her own wedding.

And she wove it and she cut out the pattern, and she hoped that it would be enough.

Just as she had finished sewing it, the Wolf passed by again:

" Well," said he, " how are you getting on? "

" Very well, sir" she replied, and showed him her wedding shift. It was made of the finest, and of the whitest, cloth that the Count had ever seen.

Now he had thought such a thing would be impossible, and he grew pale at the sight of it. But he was a proud man, and he replied gruffly, " Very good. Now begin the other."

Just as he had started to ride away, he stopped again, and turned, and said: " send your young man up to me at the castle; he should also do something for me...".

That evening, when Renelde's young man came to visit, as he did every evening, Renelde told him what the Count, what the Wolf, had said.

And so he went up to the Castle.

And when he got there, he was summoned in before the Count.

I will not bore you with the details, but the Count's thinking was this: if he could send the young man away, there would be no wedding. And if there was to be no wedding, there would be no reason for Renelde to make his funeral shift. And so he sent the boy on a quest, to find something for him that could not possibly exist. And that the boy shiould leave NOW, there was no time to waster, the sooner he left, the sooner he would be back — (ha! or never...) — and the Count would send a message to Renelde to say her young man had gone away.

"Now be about your task before you forget it", he said, and the young man was sent on his way.

The following day, Renelde was sent the news. But what could she do? If the Count had thought it would stop her from working on his funeral shift, it had the opposite effect.

She set to work event harder and faster than she had before. In the castle, a cold shiver passed over the Count. As the saying goes, it felt alnmost as if someone was walking over his grave.

He tried to eat his lunch, but he had no appetite ; he tried to warm himself by the fire, but it was as if it burned with a cold, cold flame.

All that day he got worse; he went to bed shaking with fever. But he did not sleep; and in the morning, he could not manage to rise.

This sudden illness, which at every instant became worse, started to torture him as if it were waking nightmare.

No doubt Renelde's spinning-wheel had soemthing to do with this? It was almost as if his body were preparing to dress itself in the shroud she was spinning.

So he called to his soldiers, and sent them to break the wheel to stop her spinning.

So the soldiers when to the cottage in the forest, and they broke the wheel into a thousand pieces.

But the next day, the wheel was mended, and Renelde sat down to spin again. As her young man was on his quest, so was she on hers — to finish the second shift.

Again the Count sent his guards, this time to tie her hands should be tied, and not lose sight of her for one instant.

But the guards fell asleep, the bonds undid themselves, and the Renelde spun on.

A third time the guards were sent. This time, they seized her, tied her arms and legs together, and a stone to her neck and flung her into the river, its waters swollen by the late rains.  But the ropes untied themselves, and Renelde floated up to the surface, and though she could not swim, she was somehow carried to the land.

As Renelde spun on, he Count had every nettle rooted up for three leagues round. But scarcely had they been torn from the soil when they sowed themselves afresh, and grew even as you were looking at them.

They sprung up even in the well-trodden floor of the cottage, and as fast as they were uprooted the distaff gathered to itself a supply of nettles, crushed, prepared, and ready for spinning.

And every day the Count grew worse, and watched his end approaching.

VI

Moved by pity for her husband, the Countess at last found out the cause of his illness. But even as she entreated him to allow himself to be cured, the Count, in his pride, refused to go back on his demand.

So the Countess resolved to go without his knowledge to pray for mercy from Renelde; in the name of Renelde's dead mother, she beseeched her to stop spinning.

But Renelde was determined: "He said I cannot marry until I have finished his funeral shift,"

"But neither can you marry until your young man returns... So please, stop your spinning until then, at least. For my husband's sake. For my sake."

So Renelde stopped her spinning. And waited for one month, for two, for six, for a year. The Wolf begain to recover his health, happy with thought that Renelde's young man would never return, satisfied that he would not have to retract his demand.

One day, at the marker, Renelde saw the Count. She clasped her hands as if in prayer, and cried :

" My lord, have mercy ! Tell me where he went..."

But the Wolf turned away his head and passed on.

Renelde might have humbled his pride had she gone back to her spinning-wheel again; but she did nothing of the sort.

When she came back home she looked at the silent spinning wheel in the corner, and cried for three days and three nights, and nothing her grandmother could say, or do, made things any better.

VII 

Another year went by.

But then the Count fell ill again; and the Countess supposed that Renelde, weary of waiting, had begun her spinning anew ; but when she came to the cottage to see, she found the wheel silent.

However, the Count grew worse and worse till he was given up by the doctors. The passing bell was rung, and he lay expecting Death to come for him. But Death was not so near as the doctors thought, and still he lingered.

He seemed in a desperate condition, but he got neither better nor worse. He could neither live nor die ; he suffered horribly, and called loudly on Death to put an end to his pains.

In this extremity he remembered what he had told the little spinner long ago. If Death was so slow in coming, it was because he was not ready to follow him, having no shroud for his burial.

He sent to fetch Renelde, placed her by his bedside, and ordered her at once to go on spinning his shroud.

But she reminded him of the promise she had made to his wife...

And as carried her sorrow, he lingered on the edge of life and death...

Once there was a house, a happy house.


 weeping house. The dog wept in the yard outside. The birds wept on the gutters.

Inside the master, the owner of the house sat at his table sobbing, and upstairs a young man sat at the end of his bed. His hand clenched into a fist. He cried for some bad luck he could no longer remember.

One day a young woman walked up the drive. Her hair was clogged with twigs and leave. Her clothes no more than greasy rags.She was barefoot. The dog didn't growl. He kept whining in his muddy puddle. She was taken in to see the master. She said to the old man, "I've heard of this place from the people in the village. I've heard if any young woman can make the young man in this house smile, she can marry him. I want to try. And if I fail, I don't know what I'll do."

The master said, "You aren't the first. Many women have come here, fine women who wanted for nothing except a gentleman for a husband. They took my son outside into the sunlight. They sang to him. They tickled him. They tried and failed. You have as much right to try as all the others. I wish you luck."
 
A sobbing servant led her upstairs. There sat the young man at the end of his bed, his hand clenched into a... A servant had put a bucket between his feet to catch his tears. There were grooves on his cheeks
from all the tears he'd cried. She sat beside him, "Why do you cry? You want for nothing. You have a roof over your head. You have food, servants, to wash and cook and clean for you. Me, all I have are these rags. My father, my mother are dead."

She said, "Listen to me, and I will tell you a story. Perhaps it will stop one little tear."
(bell dings)

Once upon a time, there lived a young woman called Anwen. She lived with her mother in a cottage.

They were so poor they had to share a bed. Even though they were poor, they always made sure there was smoke coming out the chimney and hens scratching in the yard outside.

One night, as she slept, and when dreamt, she should search until she found the leaves that hung but never grew. Next morning she told her mother of her dream. And her mother said, "If you set your heart on traveling, "I can't stop you, but listen to me. Sometimes the world is not the way it seems. If you see something you don't understand, wait. Watch before you speak." Anwen kissed her mother, and she said, "Oh, following the road wherever it took her."

Evening came, the sky went red, in front of the red sky, a hill. At the bottom of the hill, a cottage. At the top of the hill, a tree, with seven brawny branches, and hanging from each branch,
she saw one little leaf.

An old woman came out of the cottage, "Night is coming, and I'm sorry to tell you, the roads round here at night are not safe "for one such as you, come in."

Anwen went in, it was a strange home. Half the room was cozy and comfortable, the other half was a filthy stinking pigsty. In the pigsty there was a wild boar. When it saw Anwen, it squealed. It strained at its chain. It scuffed at the ground.

The old woman had a daughter, a young woman so gaunt that suddenly Anwen felt chubby beside her. The old woman, bag of bones, do something right for once. Go and get some water from the well. Her daughter, she went outside and she came back dragging a cauldron that slopped water onto the flagstones.

Her mother, "Anwen, I'm sure you're tired after your journey. Please sit down, eat, drink."

So Anwen sat, she ate and drank, and they talked about this, and they talked about that. And as they talked, Anwen was careful. She said nothing about the leaves that hung but never grew. She remembered her mother's advice. She said she was poor and she was searching for her fortune.

"I don't know about a fortune", said the old woman, "but I do need a bit of help around my cottage. My stupid daughter couldn't bring some water from the well without spilling it. So Anwen, if you can sweep the floor, keep the fire alight and feed the boar each night, I'll give you whatever food I can spare.

And in a few months when the boar is big and fat, We'll have a feast. What do you say?"

Anwen said she was grateful. She said she was glad to stay. The days turned into weeks. The weeks turned into- Hours. Every day she swept the fire. She, as she swept the floor, she kept the fire alight. She fed the boar each night. And every day, three times a day, the old woman gave her a plate piled high with good things to eat. And she insisted Anwen cleared the plate before she stood.

For the first time in her life, Anwen found there was flesh on her bones, instead of just skin. But a strange thing, if ever Bag of Bones, the daughter of this house, asked for another morsel, another mouthful, her mother would pick up a ladle and bounce it off her daughter's back.

It was hard for Anwen to eat when bag of bones was across the room watching her, following every fork full.
Each night, Anwen would gaze out of the window at the tree with its bony branches, with its little leaves.
but she never spoke of them.

One time, mother and daughter were outside in the yard and when was feeding the boar and she spoke her thoughts aloud for the first time. "Whole months have passed by and I'm no closer to finding out
if those are the leaves I dreamt of. What should I do?"

To her astonishment, the boar answered her.

"You have spoken to me, now I can speak. I'd given up hope that ever you would do so. Listen to me, those are the leaves you dreamt of. I was sent to find them too, although, I... I don't remember why. I was a young man then. I searched until I came to this place. I saw the leaves. I asked the old woman if I could pick them from the tree. She is a witch. She spelled me. She spelled me into a bore. Now she's fattening me up. Soon she'll slit my throat, cook me and eat me. And once she's eaten me, guess who she'll spell next.
Already she's fattening you up. Unless you want to be a sow squealing in this sty you must steal those leaves you must flee from this place."

Later when mother and daughter were fast asleep upstairs and when crapped out the cottage up the hill she pulled every leaf from its bony branch she made her way down the hill she was about to run away when she remembered the boar she went into the cottage she took the first magic leaf. And with it, she struck the boar. The leaf in her hand vanished. The boar became a young man. She had broken the spell. Anwen gasped, but before she could say anything, the young man rushed to the door. "Hurry", he said.

But Anwen hesitated. She took the poker and the broom and she put them both on a chair. She took the second magic leaf.

She struck poker, broom and chair.

"Poker, you will say, 'I am poking the fire'."

So the poker said, "I am poking the fire."

Broom, you will say, "I'm sweeping the floor."

"I am sweeping the floor.

"Chair, you will say, "I'm coming now."

"I am coming now."

Then she and the young man fled.

Next morning, the witch woke up. The cottage seemed so quiet. So she shouted down the stairs, "Anwen dear, what are you doing?"

The poker. "I'm poking the fire."

So the witch rolled over, she fell back to sleep. And all through the hours she was sleeping, Anwen and the young man were running. Eventually the witch woke up. "Anwen, what are you doing now?"

The broom: "I'm sweeping the floor."

The witch rolled over, she fell back to sleep. In a few more hours, she woke up. "Anwen, come here".

The chair said: "I'm coming now".

The witch waited. She waited and waited, no footsteps on the stairs. She looked out of the window. "Bag of Bones, the tree is bare: Anwen, she discovered our secrets. She's stolen the leaves. She's freed the young man. They're in the forest. They must be in the forest. That's where I would go if I was fleeing from this place. Off you go, my daughter, and bring me back whatever you find".

And so Bag o' Bones pulled on her clothes, and she was gone out of the hut as swift as thought. And when the young man were running, and now they could hear the sound of pursuit, just a few turns behind her on the track.

Anwen reached into her pocket, she said, "Whoever it is, we can't outrun her, so we will hide. I will throw this leaf on the ground, step on it. We will change our shapes. yYou become a pond, I will be a duck."

Round the corner of the track came Bag of Bones. The footsteps, the footprints ended.

"Little duck. Did you see a young woman? A young man pass by this way."

The duck said nothing. It disappeared beneath the surface of the water.

The witch's daughter? She went home. There was the witch.

"Well?"

"I didn't find anything. I went in the forest. I followed their footprints. They led me to a pond and on the pond I saw a sweet little duck." The footprints ended by a pond, and on the pond there was a duck.

"That was them! One feather from that duck and I'd have had both of them in a blink. Off you go my daughter, and this time bring me what you find."

Off went bag of bones, out into the forest again, and when herder approaching she took out the next magic leaf.

"We will try the same trick. This time you be a bush, I will be a bee."

"Little bee, little bee, did you see a young woman? A young man pass by this way?"

The bee said nothing. It disappeared into the pink folds of a rose.

"Little bee, little bee," the bee said, "nothing."

Bag of Bones: "pfft".

She returned to the cottage.

"Well, have you brought me what you found?"

"I didn't find anything.

I went in the forest, I followed their footprints. They led me to a bush, and on the bush there was a rose, strange to say out of season. And in the rose I saw a sweet little bee.

"A rose?" said the witch. "In the rose, there was a bee. That was them! One petal from that rose, and I'd have had both of them in a blink. Off you go, and this time, bring me what you..."

Off went Bag of Bones into the forest. Anwen heard her approaching. Anwen took out her leaf, she said,
"This time you be a tree, I will be an apple."

"Little apple, little apple swinging on your stalk. Did you see a young woman, a young man pass by this way?"

The apple said nothing. It just wriggled in the wind.

Bag of Bones went back.

"Have you brought me what you found?"

"I didn't find nothing. I went in the forest. I followed their footprints. I couldn't find a pond or a duck or a bush or a bee. All I could see was a tree. And on the tree, a red cheeked, a cheeky little apple."

"You stupid girl. If you wanna do something, you gotta do it yourself. Get out of the way". And off went the witch, running even swifter than thought.

Anwen and the young man came out of the forest, there was nowhere for them to hide. They could hear someone approaching. They came to a crossroads. Anwen reached into her pocket, two leaves left. One she kept for herself, the other she gave to the young man.

She said, "You go that way, I'll go this way. See you here in a week. If you go home, don't let anyone kiss you. You are still under an enchantment. If you are kissed, you will forget me and all that has just happened."

The young man ran his way. Anwen ran her way.

As she ran, she heard a little sound. She looked behind her and there was the witch stretching out her gray spidery hand for Anwen's hair. And when through the leaf behind her it fluttered through the air, it landed in the grass between the two of them. The witch was running even swifter than thought. She could not turn her foot and so she stepped on the leaf and turned into a sow. And that was the end of the witch.

By whatever magic is is that manages to lead us home, the young man man followed his path, and felt as if to recognise hillsides and valleys he had known in his youth. As the paths became more familiar, he started to walk faster, and faster and then he started to run.

By the time he reached the old house where he had grown up in as a child, the house where he had played in the garden and partied on the terrace, the old family dog heard the familiar footsteps, and smelled his familiar smell. The dog was so excited to smell its master. It rushed across, it lifted itself up, put its paws on the young man's chest and licked the young man's face. His father looked out the window. There was his son. He ran outside, he embraced his child.

He said, "Thank God, thank God you've returned. You've been gone so long. You hadn't written. I was so afraid that something dreadful had happened to you. Tell me, where have you been?"

But the young man had stopped in his tracks, Looking confused.

"I'm sorry",  he said. "Who are you? Where am I? Who am I?"

As for Anwen, she returned home, where she'd lived with her grandmother. As she approached it, she saw no smoke coming out the chimney, no hens scratching in the yard outside.

She pushed open the door and saw her grandmother in the bed, cold and still.

Old woman, older than the hills, who had know the girl's grandmother's grandmother, and her grandmother before her, dressing the body.

"She could wait for you no longer."

The girl nodded.. "And my wait is over too.." She went to dresser, took out two shifts. One finished, one not. In the corner was a spinning wheel, covered in dust and cobwebs. He girl sewed up shift, completing it.

In the distance, a solitary bell started to ring, sounding out the death of a the local lord. The girl placed one shift by the door. "I will see he gets it", said the old, old woman, as old as the hills. The girl  took the other.

After a week, Anwen returned to the crossroads, no one came to meet her. She took the wandering. She had no family, no money. She had to sleep under hedges, in sheds and outhouses, until her hair was clogged with twigs and leaves, until her clothes were no more than greasy rags, until she'd worn away her shoes. At last she came to a village where an old man took pity on her, gave her tea to drink, to eat.

He said, "I have had an idea. Outside the village there is a house, we used to call it the happy house, but now we know it as the weeping house. It's said if any young woman can make the young man in that house smile, she can marry him. You should go there and try your luck."

The girl's story ended.

The young man sitting at the end of his bed. He wasn't crying. He was smiling. He looked at his clenched fist. He opened his hands and...
