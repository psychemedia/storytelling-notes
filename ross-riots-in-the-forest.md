Riots in the Forest of Dean

"Monmouth, Friday Morning.

"There is at present a strong popular excitement in the Forest of Dean. A great portion of the Forest was enclosed and planted with oak, under an Act passed in 48th of George III., which plantations are now in a thriving state. The act provides that 11,000 acres are always to be kept inclosed as a nursery for timber: and that the nursery can only be legally opened by order of the Lords of the Treasury,  and that only when the young timber shall be safe for the browsing of the cattle sheep, and swine. An erroneous opinion, however, prevails among the foresters, that the inclosures should' be thrown open at the expiration of 21 years, and as the Act was passed in 1808 several of the enclosures are of a longer standing, and great dissatisfaction has been for some time felt at their continuance, and about a fortnight since a portion of the embankment was secretly destroyed. A large reward was offered for the discovery of the offenders, without effect, and hand bills were circulated, cautioning against the recurrence of similar outrages. On Wednesday morning a body of men, about eighty commenced levelling the embankments. In the course of the day their numbers increased to 500. On Thursday they continued the work of devastation, and their numbers increased to 2,000, parties being sent out in all directions to compel the colliers and other workmen to come and assist in opening the enclosures. Several miles of fences were levelled in these two days. The men worked regularly with suitable implements. Thev offered no injury to persons or private property, anil were particularly careful of the young timber. There was no military force in the neighbourhood beyond a body of about 50 men, consisting of the staff of the Monmouth Militia and a recruiting party. This small body marched towards the forest on Friday morning. There is no political feeling mixed up with the question of supposed local rights. There are reformers and anti reformers both amongst the foresters, and amongst those who were using their best endeavours to check their proceedings. The accounts from Merthyr continue favourable. The men have returned to their work. Mr. Crawshay's family have returned home—a strong indication of the restoration of order. The number killed, as gathered from the best information, is stated at seventeen or eighteen, including those who have died of their wounds."

Extract of a letter from Pontypool, Monmouthshire received in Shrewsbury yesterday by a tradesman, to whom are indebted tor the information it conveys:—

"Pontypool, Tuesday Morning, Two o'Clock.

"An old man has just come running in, sweating and breathless, to say that the rioters were at Nantyglo, nine miles from here. He had escaped from them. If they catch any that refuse to join them they cut off iheir ears. They are now two miles from here at Abersychan and much mischief is expected. They have threatened to pull down an iron master's house; and this town is all up in arms expecting the worst. It is said there are more than six thousand on their way here. The mob have taken several cannon, made a temporary battery, mounted tor regular siege; and built walls across the roads as high as a house. They are gathered from all quarters for a struggle."

There may be some little exaggeration, arising from personal fear, in the above letter. His Majesty's Ministers have given directions to the troops and soldiers in the vicinity, to march to the spot; and have no doubt the affair will soon be ended. What can misguided combinations of workmen expect, but misery, poverty, and death, as the result of combinations–*Shreswbury Chronocle.*

DISTURBANCES IN ENGLAND.—Some disturbances have broken out amongst the miners of the Forest of Dean, similar to those of the mining districts of Monmouthshire and South Wales.

Bristol Mercury - Saturday 27 April 1822

TO DO

CAUSE OF THE DISTURBANCES IN THE GREAT MINING DISTRICTS. The Country has now, unfortunately in more parts than one, an opportunity of practically proving the justice of the recent opinion, so authoritatively pronounced by Lord Londonderry, as to the advantages of low wages, as well as of the truth of his assertion, that "all classes were in a stale of prosperity, excepting the agricultural." The state to which his Lordship and his colleagues have reduced the Countrv, compels the manufacturer to reduce the prices of labour; for, if he sells the product of his manufacture at all, he must sell it at low prices, and to do this he must manufacture cheaply; consequently labour (the cost of which forms so material a part of the value of manufactured articles) must be had at low prices. Lord Londonderry's maxim in favour of low wages could not have come more ungraciously out ofthe mouth of any living being; for be has been, above all others of the present day, the man who, by laying immense burdens on the Country, has rendered it n~irossmilE for the labourer to subsist an LOW wages. The fact is, the taxes, seen and unseen, direct and indirect (the latter, be it ever remembered, vastly more onerous than the former), take so much from every man's labour and income in this country, as either to cripple his means, or wholly to deprive him of the ability to live in any sort of comfort or ease without enormous wages, or a great income from some source or other. Under these circumstances, the Iron-Masters (for, although the argument bears aliko on other manufacturers, the dreadful situation of the great Mining Districts of the kingdonpref'erablv claims our more immediate attention), finding that they rnust either sell their iron, when made, at a price lower than ever before known, or not at all, have (since the months of June or July last) made, or attempted to make, some two, and others three, distinct reductions in the wages of their workmen; and, great as must be the amount of these reductions, we are not aware that it is at all disproportionate to the necessities of their case; on the contrary, if the price of iron should not rise, of which permanently there is very little room to hope. it is well understood that still other reductions in the expense of making iron must take place, or the works cannot be carried on but at a loss, and consequently cannot be expected long to be carried on at all, at least to any thing like their present extent. Here then exists an absolute necessity for low-priced labour * and feeling this, not only fiom the exercise of their common sense, but from exprimental suffering (for we have heard, from authority which we have no reason to doubt, that great losses were en- dured by several very respectable Iron-Masters last year; and it is known too well, that absolute stoppages of others in the central Mining Districts have actually taken place) the Iron-Masters generally have endeavoured to reduce the wages of their workmen accordingly; and what has been the consequence, the deplorable state of Staffordshire, Shropshire, Monmouthshire, and South Wales, forcibly proclaims in a language which goes at once to the heart and to the understanding of every one. For these consequences, where they are the result solely of low. wages, the masters are not answerable. It is the work of necessity on their part; and, in a natural and healthy' state of the country, moderately low wages may be desirable; because the extent of the sale of the manu- factured article, next to its goodness. depends upon its cheapness; but it may be, and it certainly is, that m n inry he oppressed by such a rate of wages as alone the manu- facturer can afford to pay, or that it is the interest of the manufacture itself should be given ;-but then this is solely caused by the effect of measures emanating from a bad administration of public affairs. Where Government takes a great proportion of the proceeds of labour and of the income of property to its own use, it follows that by so mnuck the less remains for the use of the individuals who compose the aggregate of the society so nzis-governed. Thus to apply this indubitable principle in political economy to the present unhappy case of the labouring 1)ool in this country, it was admitted by a very acute disciple of the Pitt school of politics, but who from woful experience came at length to doubt the in- fallibility'of its principles; and who was himself at the time in Parliament5 that considerably more than one half of the wages of every poor man's labour went in taxes; and the accuracy of this statement has not only never been disproved, but is capable of defying disproof. There is no doubt it is so. It is not because the tax-gatherer and the titheman do not call periodically at the door of the labourer for assessed taxes, and for a tenth part of the produce of the earth, that he therefore does not pay taxes, ansl tithes, and poor-rates too; though he may be even discharged from the poor-rate by the hiumane considera- tion of' the magistrates. The poorest labourer pays all these burdens in the increased price of the provisions and necessaries of life; not an article of food goes into his mouth, not a particle of raiment clothes his back, huat he pays so much the more for them all than he would if there were no taxcz, no tithes, no poor-rates; and therefore he contributes in reality wed in fact to all these public 4ur- dens, and enormously tooas Mu. QPston has demonstrated; for, as the Duke of Bedford said at tub late Cambridge County Meeting, with truth unquestionable, * 27-re was scarcely (/ thaignblt whac was under the gripe of the exrcib .s Izanl oi:the ta-r-oilector ; even th very light of heaven was doubly tared; irst in the manufacture (of i/e glass, ansd tIen in the assessed taxes. The poor mian, whlo creeps into his hovel, is taxed for tI/e candle, the miserable candle, that tights Iissi to his pallet. Thns it is," as the Noble Duke added, "that taxutiens takes hold of every thing ;' and thus it is that faxation, by taking hold of the poor man's scanty means, renders low wages totally unequal to the decent support of himself and family. These are truths which in the present state of things it behaves no one to be ignorant of; but above all men, that Which their workcnuc at 1sresenlt iCCL, it behoves the Iron- Masters to know. The alarming situation of the Mining Districts arises not mainly out of the fault either of the master or the man, h t out of thc present dreadfully over- bu~rdened state of the country, which will not permit on the one hand the l'Ibourer to exist on low wages, and which at the sate time will not admit of Lhe mnatter selljing the produce of his works at such price as will enable bhi to afford h/igh wases. It fbliows then, necessarilv, that it is the real interest of the Iron-Master to promote such retrenchment and reform as will relieve the country of a large proportion of its public I nirdns; and the master-key to all these is such a ?eflurm in thAe Reps'ces62tatiea of' i;e Peotle in the Commons 1e use of Parlianient as will .estore Parliaments to their shorter term of duiotibn in letter. times, and extend the elective franchise so as to make the exercise of it more like what it was in the happier days of our forefathers, and a more equitable resemblanice of that which the Constitution intended, and which it is the inalienable right of Britons to enjoy. For taxation without representation is not only, what Lord Chathamn called it, "TYRANNY," but it will also in the end be found to be the Most MISTAKEN AND MISCHIEVOUS POLICY. The Mining Districts of Staffordshire and Shropshire are reported to be, in some respects, even in a worse situation than those of Moninouthihire and Sbuth Wales; and in the Forest of Dean disturbances are skid to have broken out. Oar London Papers did not arrive last night: Lord John Russell brought on his motion on Parliamentary Reform on Thursday evening; we have not learnt, though we can easily anticipate, its fate.

Monmouthshire Merlin - Saturday 01 January 1831

FOREST OF DEAN. To the Editor of the Monmouthshire Merlin.

Sir,— Whilst the greatest part of the kingdom are now labouring under great degrees of excitement, I have to exult in being a resident in the most peaceable part of the king's dominions; for altho' the inhabitants are Foresters (a term of terror to some timid persons who are not acquainted with their real character), we have not had a single instance of incendiarism, disloyalty, rebellion, or riot, in any town, village, or hamlet between the rivers Severn and Wye, whilst our neighbours on every side have had repeated acts of diabolical pursuits. Although there are many thousands of the labouring classes suffering great and severe privations from the general distress, there still is not to be found in any class (and I am in the habit of visiting all classes daily) an instance of strife-stirring persuasion; they generally and universally hold the unpardonable incendiaries in the greatest abhorrence. It is true they have lost many valuable local privileges through their apathy, but they possess too much of the real British character to run into rashness and riot, under the mistaken notion of bettering their condition. Indeed their peaceable demeanour, and truly praiseworthy decorum, at this period of general excitement, entitles them justly to public congratulation; and I will assert, Mr. Editor, without the fear of contradiction (for I travel at all hours), that although the Forest of Dean appears to the eye of the stranger a wild and dreary place, still the most timid may travel either by night or day, from Sabrina to Vaga, or from East to West of this immense track of land, without the fear of robbery, riot, or molestation, and with much greater safety than any of the streets of London, Bristol, or their suburbs. A case of highway robbery is not known among us, and the few, very few cases of burglary that have happened have been committed by strangers and adepts in the felonious calling; but should we be visited by any of the Swingites, depend upon it, Mr. Editor, the Foresters will give a long pull, a strong pull, and a pull altogether, to stop the unprincipled marauder and the vile disturber of public tranquillity. But, thank God, sir, we want no military visitors, no yeomanry police, no special constables. We are, Mr. Editor, poor, poor, very poor but we are also quiet, quiet, very quiet.

I am, Mr. Editor, your most obedient servant, Forest of Dean, Dec. 29, 1830. ACORNPATCH

EXCERPT FROM MONMOUTHSHIRE MERLIN (original scan missing?)

TO DO chatgpt

We shall commence by taking a review of the claim out of which their late tumultuous proceedings have originated. It appears that from time immemorial certain inhabitants of the Forest have exercised a right of common of pasture, and of herbage, through certain districts. By an act of the 20th of Charles II, c. 3, after reciting that the wood and timber of the forest, which of late years was of very great quantity and value, within the Forest of Dean, was become totally destroyed (except as therein is mentioned), whereby there was an appearance of scarcity of timber there, as in all other parts of the kingdom, so that some course was necessary to be speedily taken to restore and preserve the growth of timber for the future support of His Majesty's navy and the maintenance of shipping for the trade of the nation,—it was enacted that 11,000 acres, statute measure, at 16½ feet to the perch, of the said Forest should be enclosed, and remain so enclosed, until the Lord Treasurer, the Commissioners of the Treasury, or the Chancellor of the Exchequer should be satisfied that the trees growing on the said 11,000 acres were become past danger of the browsing of deer, cattle, or other prejudice, and should think fit to lay open the same, or any part thereof, consisting of 500 acres or more; and that in such case it should be lawful for His Majesty, in lieu of so much of the said 11,000 acres as should be laid open, to enclose the like quantity out of any other part of the forest wastes. A clause in the same act makes void any estate or interest in the forest lands which might be thereafter obtained by any person from the Crown. Another clause gives to the owners and occupiers of forest lands, as a compensation in lieu of the right of common and of herbage, taken from them by the before-mentioned enclosures, the privilege of cutting down and selling for their own use any timber growing upon their several lands; and also the privilege of improving, enclosing, fencing, and building on said lands—keeping dogs—and of hunting and killing beasts of chase and other game. The 11th section saves the liberties and privileges of all persons in and through the said forest at such times as the same should not be enclosed, and provides how the right of pannage and of common pasture should thereafter be enjoyed. An act of the 48th Geo. III, c. 72, confirms the before-mentioned statute of Charles II. in all its essential particulars, and directs how persons wilfully destroying any of the fences or enclosures shall be punished. The third offence is made felony, and subjected to seven years’ transportation, fine, or imprisonment, at the discretion of the judge before whom the offender may be tried.



before whom the offender may be tried.

In pursuance of the foregoing acts of Parliament, we under-
stand that 11,000 acres have been regularly enclosed. Some
evil genius lately suggested to the foresters that the enclosures
were not legal, and that they would be justified in destroying
them. The credulous foresters gave ear to the tempter, and
immediately proceeded to act on his suggestion. On the night
of Saturday, the 21st of May, part of the fence of an enclo-
sure, called Oaken Hill, was thrown down, and the gates of
that and other enclosures entirely demolished. A reward of
20 guineas having been offered by Mr. Machen for the disco-
very of the offenders, an old collier, named James, went, we
are told, to that gentleman and claimed the reward by declar-
ing that he and his three sons had done the mischief. Similar
nightly acts of destruction were continued until Wednesday
morning last, when several hundreds of the foresters assem-
bled at an early hour, with the avowed purpose of levelling
all the fences throughout the forest. The magistrates, hear-
ing of their intentions, went out to meet them before they
had commenced their illegal proceedings, and having in vain
endeavoured to dissuade them from their purpose, read the riot
act. There being no military on the spot, the foresters laugh-
ed at the proceeding, and began the work of ruin, in which
they laboured with as much zeal and ardour as if their lives
depended upon its speedy execution. This lawless system
was continued during the whole of Wednesday and until
Thursday night, by which time several miles of the enclosures
were prostrated. On Wednesday one of the magistrates went
to Merthyr for some soldiers. He returned by the mail on
Thursday, with Major Mackworth, but none of the military
could, it seems, be spared from Merthyr. Between 6 and 7
o'clock yesterday morning, the staff of the Militia, and a
recruiting party of Marines stationed in Monmouth, together
with the pensioners residing in the town and neighbourhood
(the whole group not exceeding 34 in number), marched well
armed for the scene of action. Expectation is on the tip-toe
to learn the result of their expedition, but no tidings have ar-
rived. The foresters as yet have confined themselves to the de-
struction of the fences: their language up to this time being—
"Do not molest us in our object, and we will not molest you.
Bring the soldiers against us, and we will repel force with force
—spill our blood, and yours shall be spilt."

We do not hesitate to declare that the man who has taken
so much pains to delude these simple and naturally unoffend-
ing creatures is no better than a demon—one of those Afrites
we read of in Eastern story, whose delight consists in scourg-
ing and afflicting the human race. We invite the poor de-
luded men to come to us for advice. If any of their just
rights are withheld, we pledge ourselves to leave no stone un-
turned to obtain for them what they are entitled to. The be-
nefit of our legal experience, and of our abilities, such as
they are, shall be gratuitously at their service. Let them not
listen to the seductive promises of wretches whose sole object
it is to make tools of them for their own purposes, and who,
to gain what they seek, would be the first to consign their
dupes to the dungeon and the scaffold!

[Image 2 text]

FRIDAY, 10 o'CLOCK.—We have just had a long conver-
sation with a gentleman from the Forest, who has instructed us in
some particulars that may not be uninteresting to our readers.
The soldiers who left Monmouth this morning had established
a sort of garrison in the market-house of Coleford. They had
not attempted to take any hostile proceedings against the le-
vellers, but warrants had been issued for the apprehension of
the ringleaders, and it was expected they would surrender
without opposition. The man, named Warren James, to
whom we have before alluded, is the chief instigator and di-
rector of the proceedings. The story goes, that through some
nobleman in London, he has discovered an old charter or act
of Parliament, giving certain rights to the foresters, of which
they can never be deprived. One of the foresters told our in-
formant on Tuesday that it "was a document of undoubted
authenticity, having been signed by seven English kings,
among whom was his late Majesty George IV., who affixed
his signature to it just before he died." The same man ac-
quainted our informant of what was intended to be done on
the Wednesday morning, when the work of destruction com-
menced; and the whole came to pass exactly as he had pre-
dicted. James and a large party of his companions assem-
bled at Whitemead Park, declaring their intention to level
the fences. Mr. Machen and several other gentlemen went
out to remonstrate with them, explaining the acts of Par-
liament under which the enclosures had taken place, and
inquiring to know by what act or acts of Parliament they pro-
fessed to make out their claim. James said he would go
and fetch the acts on which the rights of himself and
associates were founded. He accordingly disappeared for a
few minutes, and, returning with a face of the most impertur-
bable gravity, produced, as the vouchers of his privileges, an
enormous pick-axe. Finding that they could do nothing with
the mob, and not having sufficient force, civil or military, to
restrain their proceedings, the magistrates went away, on
which James sent for a constable, and in his presence super-
intended the work of destruction, observing that he had sent
for him to keep the peace. James is one of those men who,
by some means or other, has got a smattering of legal terms
and phrases, from the general use of which, and of a great
degree of natural shrewdness, he has obtained the nickname
of "The counsellor." His fate will most assuredly prove
"a little knowledge is a dangerous thing." It will be seen
by our former statement that the enclosure of the forest was
directed for national purposes. Without the oak nursery we
can have no timber—without the timber no ships—and with-
out ships, alas for Great Britain, the gem of the sea! By the
statute of Charles II., the rights of the foresters to pannage
and pasturage in the whole forest are admitted, and privileges
are reserved in compensation for those of which by the
enclosure they would be deprived. This arrangement ap-
pears to have been fair and equitable.

Certainly, I'll transcribe the text from all three images, including the continuation of the column across the images.

[Image 1]

Nearly two centuries have passed since it was entered into,
and no opposition has, up to this time, been raised against it.
We wish not to take the part of the strong against the weak—
of the rich against the poor—of the government against the
people; but we are convinced that on this occasion the fores-
ters are in the wrong, and we tell them so because we are their
real friends. We know, as we said before, that they are na-
turally inoffensive. Let them open their eyes, let them use
the common sense with which they are endowed, and they
will see at once how grievously they have been misled. If
James had been in possession of any legal authority for his
proceedings, why did he not produce it to Mr. Machen? A
pick-axe wielded by a strong arm is not an emblem of equity
or justice, but of force and violence. Let the levellers look at
the mischief they have done. Thousands of young thriving
trees, the pride and earnest of future protection to the soil
from which they sprung, will be destroyed, without any
corresponding advantage to the authors of the mischief. The
parts enclosed are almost overgrown with briars and weeds,
and for some time will afford little, if any, herbage to the
cattle. Before the foresters can derive any benefit from the
pasturage, the fences will be restored; and the only reward
for the labour of those who may escape unpunished will be the
miserable reflection that they have added to the burdens and
diminished the resources of their impoverished country.

(From a Correspondent of the Globe.)
MONMOUTH, Sunday Morning.
The small force collected in this town on Friday morning
returned last night from Colford, without having made any
attempt to stop the levellers in their work of destruction,
which was pursued with renewed avidity the whole of Friday
and Saturday, and the entire of the enclosures are now open;

[Image 2]

or where the walling or embankment is not completely down,
gaps or breaches of about 100 yards are made at intervals of
the same length; on Friday there was the greatest display of
strength, and at least 3,000 men were engaged in gangs, varying
in number from 50 to 300, throughout every portion of the fo-
rest. It would almost exceed belief, that in the open day such a
number should assemble, their persons and residences in num-
berless instances known to the magistrates, gentry, and keepers,
and that no force has been assembled to resist outrage so fla-
grant; nearly 50 miles of substantial mounds and walling have
been levelled in the short space of four days, and upwards of
10,000 acres of fine young timber, of about 20 years' growth,
laid open. There is some movement in this business which
demands prompt and strict investigation. The writer of this
conversed with two men who were pressed on Thursday, and
compelled to assist in throwing down the banks, and it is
evident from their report, that the great majority of the
foresters believe that Warren James, their openly avowed
leader, whose name is affixed to the handbill calling the meet-
ing to lay open the enclosures, and who is the O'Connell of
the forest, is but the agent of some one or more noblemen
in town, who are determined "to see the foresters right-
ed." It would not be prudent or just to use the names of
the parties mentioned, for perhaps it is a licence taken by the
leaders of the rioters without authority. A sister of James's,
it is said, lives with a nobleman, who the foresters expect will
be in the forests shortly again, and James has been twice to
town to have interviews on this business; one fact is evident,
that the poor men are acting under the impression that they
are committing no illegal act, and that no resistance will be
offered them, and the events of the past week prove their
view in the latter instance to be correct. There is another
singular feature in this business worthy attention: the differ-
ent parties were accompanied by carts containing provisions,
and hogsheads of cider were distributed to the men in the
progress of the work. The only instance of outrage beyond

[Image 3]

the primary object of the foresters is the pulling down the
garden walls of Mr. Goold, accompanied with a promise of
serving his house in the same manner, and occasional
threats of personal violence to any persons who they judge
are put as spies to their conduct. Whether these dis-
turbances are to end here, time only will develop;
some of the more violent are for proceeding to other
acts of violence; the railways which intersect the fo-
rest in every direction, and the turnpike gates, are ru-
moured to be the next objects of attack, but the leaders
appear to consider that the work for which they assembled
was finished last night. The only shadow of a question of
right appears to be, that the act provides that only 11,000
acres, together with a small quantity of about 500 or 600
acres previously enclosed, shall be kept as a nursery for tim-
ber; now the foresters declare that considerably more have
been enclosed. Their assertion that the timber is of sufficient
stature not to require protection is untrue; the most experi-
enced woodwards, totally unconnected with the Crown lands,
agree that the embankments should be kept up from seven to
ten years yet to come. Be this as it may, the uninterrupted pro-
gress of the foresters during the last week cannot but have an
injurious effect on the bad spirits on the Monmouthshire and
Welch hills, and the events of the coming week are looked
forward to with considerable anxiety.

Nottingham Review - Friday 17 June 1831

TO DO
RIOTS IN THE FOREST DEAN Monmouth, Friday.— The inhabitants of this town and neighbourhood had scarcely recovered from the anxiety necessarily attendant the re suit of the tumult at Merthyr, w hen their attention was draw n to another popular display of feeling Parkend, in the forest of Dean, distant seven miles from this town. A great portion of this extensive forest was, by the Geo. 111. cap. 72, inclosed and planted with oak, and which plantations are now in a thriving state of luxuriance; this act provides that eleven thousand acres are always to be kept inclosed as a nursery for the timber. An opinion generally prevails amongst the foresters that these inclosures should have been thrown open at the expiration of twenty-one years, and as the act was passed in there are several inclosures which have been fenced for a longer period; but a reference to the act must have convinced these poor men of their error, for a section therein provides that the fences can only be legally opened by order of the Lords of the Treasury, and that at a period when the young timber shall be safe from the browsing of the cattle, sheep, and swine, which the inhabitants are in the custom of driving tack. There have been several meetings of the foresters respecting these inclosures, and about fortnight since a portion of embankment was secretly destroyed at Oaken-hill; this caused a large reward to be offered for the discovery of the offenders, without effect, and as it was generally un. derstood that some manifestation of feeling was to be displayed this week, precautionary hand bills, signed by Edward Maehen, Esq., a gentleman much respected, and who holds an official situation in the forest, were circulated ; but, regardless of the consequences, on Wednesday morning, a body of men, at first about 80, but whose numbers were increased in the course of the day to 400 or 500, commenced the opening of the inclosures by levelling the embankments. On Thursday, this work of devastation w-as renewed and, it is said, before the close of yesterday near were industriously engaged in the work. The men are provided with tools; they offer no violence to the persons properties of the neighbourhood, and not injure the young timber. There are many contradictory reports of the extent of damage, and it would not prudent to state an opinion founded on rumour; but it is certain that several miles in length of fences w ere destroyed in these two days. The collieries were stopped yesterday, and parties were sent out in all directions to compel the foresters, who prudently abstained from this illegal work, to lend a helping hand until every enclosure in the forest was opened. We have no force in this immediate neighborhood, to resist this singular yet daring violation of the law', beyond a body of about fifty men, which assembled this morning, consisting of the Monmouth Militia Staff, marine recruiting party, and pensioners, who marched at six o’clock for Colford, where it is reported they are to be met a similar force from Gloucester from the known determined character of the foresters, and their acquaintance with the intricacies of the forest, much alarm is manifested for the safety of this handful of men. In this case, well as at Merthyr, no general political feeling is mixed up with the question of supposed local right or grivance. Reformers and anti reformers are alike mixed up with the rioters, and men who a few weeks since were the most widely opposed in the political feeling of a contested election, arc now united in the suppression of these disturbances.” Monmouth, Sunday Morning. —The small force collected in this town on Friday morning, returned last night from Colford, without having made any attempt to stop the levellers their w'drk of destruction, which was pursued with re newed avidity the whole of Friday and Saturday, and the entire of the enclosures are now open ; for where the walling or embankment is not completely down, gaps or breaches of about yards are made at intervals of the same length ; Friday there was the greatest display of strength, and at least three thousand men were engaged in gangs, varying in number from fifty to three hundred, throughout every portion of the forest. It would almost exceed belief, that in the open day such a number should assemble, their persons and residences in numberless instances known to the ma gistrates, gentry, and keepers, and that no force has been assembled to resist outrage so flagrant; nearly fifty miles of substantial mounds and walling have been levelled in the short space of four days, and upwards of ten thousand acres of fine young timber, of about twenty years’growth, laid open. There is some movement in this business which demands prompt and strict investigation. The writer of this conversed with two men who were pressed on Thursday, and compelled to assist in throwing down the banks, and it is evident from their report, that the great majority of the foresters believe that Warren James, their openly avowed leader, whose name is affixed to the hand-bill calling the meeting to lay open the inclosures, and w ho is the O’Connell of the forest, is but the agent of some one or more noblemen in town, who are determined see the foresters righted.” It would not be prudent or just to use the names of the parties mentioned, for perhaps it is a license taken by the leaders of the rioters without authority. A sister of James’s, it is said, lives with a nobleman, who the foresters expect will be in the forests shortly again, and James has been twice town to have interviews on this business; one fact is evident, that the poor men are acting under the impression that they are committing no illegal act, and that no resistance will be offered them, and the events of the past week prove their view in the latter instance to be correct. There is another singular feature in this business worthy attention : the different parties were accompanied carts containing provisions, and hogsheads of cyder were distributed to the men in the progress of the work. The only instance of outrage beyond the primary object of the foresters, is the pulling down the garden walls of Mr. Goold, accompanied with a promise of serving his house in the same manner, and occasional threats of personal violence any persons whom they judge are put as spies to their conduct. Whether these disturbances are to end here, time only will develope; some of the more violent are for proceeding to other aets of violence; the railways which intersect the forest in every direction, and the turnpike-gates are rumoured to be the next objects of attack, but the leaders appear to consider that the w'ork for which they assembled was finished last night. The only shadow of a question of right appears to be, that the act provides that only eleven thousand acres, together with a small Quantity of about 500 or 600 acres previously enclosed, shall be kept as a nursery for timber; now the foresters declare that considerably more have been enclosed. Their assertion that the timber is of sufficient stature not to re-, quire protection is untrue ; the most experienced woodwards, totally unconnected with the Crown lands, agree that the embankments should be kept up from seven to ten years yet to come. Be this as it may, the uninterrupted progress of the foresters during the last week cannot but have an injurious effect on the had spirits the Monmouthshire and Welch hills, and the events of the coming week arc looked forward to with consideiable anxiety. Since writing the above, the militia staff, Stc., have just received orders to be in readiness to-morrow morning, at five o’clock —their number will be increased several volunteers.

TUMULTUOUS ASSEMBLA GE'S IN TIlE FORESST o)JI' nib' 1jv, 4iN) n)i.STR'UC'IO.N 01 7kII' G (JJ'EN- 11IEAl7'1N('lO0SUIES. - [F'lOAr THIE MONMOUTIIS17RE MIERLIU.] It has seldom, perhaps never, fallen to the lot of any provincial journalist to have to record, at the saine time, two instances of aldarming riotill his owiVnI in cfidi ate neighlho nh hod. Sicll, how ever, is now our painful duty. Trliee or four months ago we iiserted a letter, unIder the signature of Acorn patch,' in which, Liter ex- p1lillinig thlie coo ition of the people in the Forest of Dean, the witer emphatically says-' We are pour, poor, very poor ; hut We ale quiet, quiet, very quiet.' The character thus gi en of the foresters was at that period must stilctly true. Although suit. ing the greatest distress and privations-although contiiuaily excited to acts of tumult and disorder by Swiuigites and Cobietites without number, they remalned firm in tltheir allegiance to the liing anil to the laws, and never for a niooient fell away from that feeling of patriotism, whose still smnall voice is ever wlhisperiiig in the ears of an honest marl, that it is better to endure eveiy kind of misery anid hardship ins unstained loyalty, than to light the tiiich of discord, and be the cause of blioodsbed arid desolation in the land of his bi th. We feel persuaded that the foresters have always hitherto acted upon this principle, anid tUt but for a delusion, into which they have been led by the artifices of de- signing men, we should not now have to relate occurrences, which seem for the first time to throw a shade upon their peace- ableness and patriotism. We shall commserce by taking a review of the claim out of :vwhich their late tumultuous proceedings have originated. It ap- pears that from time immemorial certain inhabitants of the Forest have exercised a right of common, of pasture, and of pannage thr ougsh certain districts. By an Act of the 20th. of Charles I., e. 3, after reciting that the woiod and timber (of the Crown, which of late years was of very great quantity and value within the Fo- rest of Dean, was become totally destroyed (except as therein is mentioned), whereby there was an apparent scarcity of timber tthere. as In all ather parts of the kingdom, so that some course lwas necessary to be speedily taken to restore and preserve the growth of timber for the future support of his Majesty's navy and the maintenance of shipping for the trade of the nation-it was enacted that 11,000 acres, statute measure, at 1t;4 feet to the perch, ot the sai iI (orest, should he enclosed, arid remain so enclosed until the Jord Treasurer, the Commissioners ot the Treasury, or the Chancellor of the Exchequer shiould lie satisfied that the trees - rowing on the said 11,000 acres were become past danger of the browsing of deer, cattle, or other prejudice, and shoulld think fit to lay iipen the same, or any part thereof, consistiligof five ; uiiiredl acres or ioire; ali i that ill sucI i case it shi(il d be lawful for his Majesty, in lieu of so much of the said e-leven thousauid acres as should be laid open, to inclose the like quantity out of any other part of the forest wastes. A clause ill the same Act makes void any estate or interest in the f forest lanils which might be thereafter obtained hiy ianty person e frion the Crown. Another clause gives to the owners and iccu- piers of foirest liaduls as a comrpensationi in lieu of the right of common and of herhage, taken froim theii by the befoiiie mentioned e eiiclosu es, the privilege of cutting doiwn aniii selling for their tiOWIn USe' any t ii)e ' growing UmponI their several lanids ; all d also e the pu iviloge of improving, enclosing, fencing, aid building oui tile said lands-of keeping dogs-and of huntilng and killing beasts a of chase and other gamle. The lItrk section saves the liberties and privileges of all persons in and through the said forest at 5 sulcl times as the same should not be encloseil, ndI provides hI o(w the right of panruige anid of common pasture should there- after lie enjoyed. An Act of the 48th Gen. Ill., c. 72L, confirms the lief oe-mlentioned statute of Charles If. in all its essential particiliars, and directs hlow persons, wilfully destroying any of (tie fences or erIliSUres, shalt be puiiished. The third offence is imade felony, and subjected to seven years' transportation, fine, e or irprisonmnent, at the discretion of the Judge before whom the e offeiidern may be tried. T on pursuanceofthe foregoingActs of Parliament, we understand . that 11,000 acres have been regularly inclosed. Some evil genius lately suggested to the foresters that the inclosures were not legal, d id that they would be justified in destroying them. The creduo- d ous foresters gave ear to the tempter, and immediately proceeded S to act on his suggestion. On the night of Saturday, the 21st of M May, part of tile fence of an hiclosure, called Oaken Hill, swas thrown down, and the gates of that and other iuclosures g entirely demolished. A reward of fifty guineas having been e offered by Mr. Maclien for the discovery of the offenders, aii old f' collier, naied James, went, we are told, to that geritltiiiaii soil 9 clahnied the reward, by declaring that hle and his three sons lied 1n done the mischief. Similar nightly acts of destruction were con- Untinueed until Wednesday morning last, when several hundreds of athe fiiresters assembledi at an eailly hour, with the avowed purpose of levelling all the fences tlirouglonct thefornest. [lie Magistrates, d hearing of their intentiins, went out to meet them before they a had commenced thlieir illegal proceedings, and having in vain enleavoured to dissuade them from their purpose, read 5 the Iflot Act. There being no military on the spot, the foresters . iiugied at the proceeding, and began the work of ruin, in. which it they laboured with as much zeal and ardour as if their lives de- :- pexdcd upon its speedy execution. This levelling system was con- b tinued during the wvhole of Wednesday, and until Thursday night, Y by which time several miles of the inclosures were prostrated. On Wednesday one of tire Magistrates wvent to Merthyr fo'r some sol- e dieis. He returned by the mail on Thursday with Major Mack- if worth, but nolle of the military could, it seens, be spared front 0 Merthyr. Between six arnd seven o'clock yesterday morning, the If Staff of the Militia and a reeruiing party of Marines, stationed in It Monmouth, together with the pensioners residing in the town. and e neighbourhood (the whole group not exceedEng 34 ill number) Ce incaredl well-armned for the scene of action, Expectation Is on 3, the tip-toe to learn the result of their expedition, but no tidings haive arrived.

They had not at- t- tempted to take any hostile proceedings against the lhvellers, hut 1O warrants had been issued for the apprehension of the ringleaders, 'd and it was expected they would surrender without opposition. The se man named Warren James, to whom we have before alluded, is Iv the chief instigator and director of the proceedings. The story igoes, that through some Noblemais in London, lie has discovered 'd an old charter or Act of Parliament, giving certain rigists to the it foresters, of wvhich they carn never be deprived. One of the r- foresters told our informsant ornTuesdaythat it ' was a document of 'r1 undoubted authenticity, has'ing been signed by seven English [irgs, - amongst whoin was his late Majesty George the Fourth, who af- zo fixed hiss sigrnature to it just before lie died.' The same mant ac- ail qouaiited our informant of what was intended to be done on the te Wednesday morning, when the work of destruction commencedh .d aniltile wvhole camLe topass exactly as tile hlidpreulicted Jamies arid or a large party et his companionls assembled at Whiteinead Park, de- y clairing their intention to level tile fences. Mr. Machen and several r theri gentlemen went out to remonstrate with them, explaining the m Acts or Parliament under which the enclosures had taken place' and ~s reqouilu rg to kinoiv by what Act or Acts of Parliament they plroferssed me to make out their claim. James said lie would go and fetch the it Acts (in which the rights of lhisself aid comradqs were founded. d He accordingly disappeared for a few minutes, and returning withl ly a face of the most lumperturbable gravity, produced, as thevoucher of his privilegeg,.all enoi-mous pick-axe. F'inding that they could do nothing ,with thle mob', and not having sufficient force, civil or miolitary, to restrain their proceedings, the Magistrates went away ; onl which James sent for a constable, illid inl his presence stiperin-p tended the work of destruction, observing that hie hadl sent for him to keep the peace. JamCs is onle of those mlen Who, by somne means I or other, has got at smattering of legal terms & phrases, from the ge- jieral itse of whiche, anid of at great degree oif natural shrewdness, hie hais obtainied te lieciki~Arnieof "I'iheCouns~ellor.''

The d~eath of the late King, artd thle consequent dissolution of the Parliament, atiti breaking up oif the Wefliilgton Admuinistration, prevented any furtiter proIceedin0g. It is said that since that time, the foresters have memorializted thle present Commissioners of Woods and Forests on tile subject, hut without success. At the time they were in negociationi with tile late Ministry, a large subscription was alade atonog thecm, f01' the purpose of obtaining an Act for the opening of the enloctsures ; aitd it is certaill that this fund'has been sllbscribedl to by all tite poorer classes In the neigihbourhood of thle Forest.

Monmouthshire Merlin - Saturday 18 June 1831

TO DO
FOREST OF DEAN. ARRIVAL OF THE MILITARY-DISPERSION GF THE LEVELLERS AND APPREHENSION OF THE RINGLEADERS. Our account of the proceedings in the Forest of Dean last week was necessarily concluded at a very interesting crisis, like an act in some dramatic entertainment, where the curtain drops upon a scene of great excitement, leaving the imagination upon the fret, until the time arrives for its further development. We must confess that we were not prepared for so favourable an issue as we have now to record. Up to Saturday evening the Foresters continued their work of devastation, and spoke in the most reso- lute manner of their determination to proceed in the task.they had imposed upon themselves, and if any obstruction were offered, to repel force by force. These threats, happily for themselves, were not carried into execution. The arrival in Coleford, on on Sunday, of a squadron of the 3d Dragoons, with their loaded pistols and carabines—their naked swords glittering in the sun-thelf limbs of Herculean mould-and their dashing military appearance, struck terror into the hearts of the bravest. These troops were reinforced on Monday morning by a large de- tachment of the 11th regiment of foot. On Sunday evening the Duke of Beaufort and the Marquis of Worcester arrived at Troy, and on the following morning proceeded to Coleford, where they were met by Sir Thomas Crawley Boevey, the High Sheriff of Gloucestershire, and a large party of Magistrates. At 11 o'clock a detachment of Dragoons, 50 of the Infantry, under the com- mand of Major Mackworth, a large body of keepers, two of the London police establishment, accompanied by a body of Magis- trates and Gentlemen, amongst the foremost of whom was the Marquis of Worcester, moved off for the Forest, and scoured the country in the direction of Parkend and Bream. In this entire district, which presented such a busy scene last week, scarcely a human being was to be seen. This force returned to Coleford at five o'clock, having captured seven prisoners, who were identified as having been employed in tearing down the fences. About this time an alarm reached the Magistrates that the Foresters had assembled in considerable force on the Ruardean-hill, and were engaged in destroying the remaining embankments. A troop of Dragoons was immediately dispatched to that quarter, but their very appearance in the distance frightened the levellers, and be- fore the Dragoons reached the work of destruction not a man was to be seen as the night was now drawing on, the troop returned to Coleford with one prisoner, having previously sent in two others. The greatest exertions were of course made to apprehend James, the instigator and fomenter of the whole proceedings.— His house was searched on Monday, but the bird had flown and his wife stated that he had not been home since the preceding Friday. On Wednesday morning a report came to Coleford that he had concealed himself in a place called Hang-lnt-a very ominous name for one who had been guilty of felony with- out benefit of clergy. The constable who had the warrant for his apprehension, proceeded to the spot with a party of the mili- tary, and gave a signal usual among the colliers, to which James replied; and believing himself to be in friendly hands, suffered the party to draw him up from the pit, when he was immediately taken into custody. On his examination before the magistrates he was very dogged and sullen, and no information could be elicited from him. He was therefore committed to Gloucester Gaol to take his trial at the next assizes. A man named Birt, who, with two or three of his sons, had been very active in de- molishing the inclosures, was alsq> committed at the same time. The rest of the prisoners taken oft Monday were admitted to bail. To shew that James wilfully misled the poor Foresters, who acted according to his suggestions, we need only state, that in his house was found an opinion of Sir Edward Sugden, at direct variance with what he had been promulgating amongst his simple countrymen as the law of the land. About 100 miles of the fences have been either destroyed or damaged, and the esti- mated expense of repairing them is £ 5000. The work of resto- ration has already commenced. One hundred men have been constantly employed for that purpose since Wednesday, and each of the keepers is allowed two persons to assist him in clearing the inclosures. On Thursday, a man named Harris, alias Welshman, alias Poise-foot, another leveller of notoriety, was apprehended by Watkins the constable, and two of the forest keepers. When discovered and summoned to surrender, he brandished a large knife, and swore that he would be the death of any man who might venture to approach him. The constable and keepers im- mediately rushed upon and disarmed him. While they were conducting him before the magistrates he contrived, without being perceived, to draw from his pocket a pistol, which he placed close to the ear of the constable and snapped. The pistol fortunately missed fire, otherwise Watkins must have been a dead man for, on being taken from him it was found loaded up to the muzzle. For this attempt at assassination the ruffian has been committed to take his trial at the next Gloucester assizes. A general impression has gomf forth; that Mr. Machen, with a previous knowledge of the intentions of the Foresters to destroy the inclosures, took no steps to prevent them from accomplishing their object; that in the first instance there were but 40 or 50 levellers employed and that with a few constables he might have stifled the mischief in its birth. This is altogether a false notion. We are informed by a gentleman who was present on the morning when the demolition commenced, that Mr. Machen had provided himself with 50 men, upon whose zeal and fidelity he could rely, and wbo were anxious to attempt the dispersion of the levellers, but the numbers of the latter were so much superior that Mr. Machen would not allow them to interfere. The gen- tleman in question confidently assures us, that in the very outset of the business there were at least 80 men at work-that from 100 to 120 more stood looking on—and that the tops of the neighbouring hills were crowded with people, who were hasten- ing to the scene of action. Any attempt to disperse the rioters under such circumstances would have been an act of great im- prudence, to say the least of it. We shall take this opportunity also of correcting the very mean opinion that has been entertained of the small corps, con- sisting of the militia staff, the marine recruiting party, and the pen- sioners, which left Monmouth for Coleford yesterday se'nnight. -On leaving Monmouth, and on their arrival in Coleford, they were sneered at and ridiculed. So fat, however, were they from deserving the contempt with which they were treated, that Major Mackworth, after putting them through their evolutions, undertook before the magistrates assembled at Coleford, with their assistance alone, to stop the proceedings of the levellers.- The answer of the magistrates deserves to be recorded in letters of gold. "We do not doubt your ability, but bloodshed will be the consequence. Our object is not to murder the peasantry, bat to shew them such a force as will convince all but fools and idiots that resistance will be in vain." The conduct of these men during their stay in Coleford was so exemplary, that they left that town with the respect and gratitude of the inhabitants, and the following testimonial from the magistrates :— The Magistrates assembled at Coleford cannot allow Captain Mitchell and Captain Kane, with the men under their command, to return home without begging these officers to accept of their best thanks for the ready manner in which they complied with the wishes of the Magistrates to attend at Coleford in aid of the civil power, and for the active and attentive manner in which they have performed the duty imposed upon them and they re- quest the officers will be so good as to explain to the non-com- missioned officers and men.under their command, how highly the Magistrates approve of iheirconduct. (Signed) BEAUFORT. MAYNARD COLCHESTER. WORCESTER. CHARLES CRAWLEY. GEORGE ROOKE. EDWARD MACHEN." P. S. DUCAREL. We understand that a proposal was yesterday made to the magistrates, on the part of the levellers who were not assembled on Wednesday se'nnight when the riot act was read, and who did not make themselves conspicuous by pressing others into the illegal service, that they may be absolved from the penalties they have incurred on giving one week's work, in reparation of the mischief committed. By this offer the Foresters have shewn that they are sensible of their error and on account of the delusion that has been practised upon them, we do hope the proposal will not be rejected. In mercy to their wives and poor helpless children, let the rules of justice be a little relaxed. Their con- duct in general has been peaceable and orderly, and the punish- ment of the ringleaders, who have been already taken, will con- vince them for the future, that every violation of the laws must end in sorrow and repentance. For our own parts we have not been indifferent to the interests of these poor people. We have employed the greater part of the past week in hunting for and perusing documents on the subject of the rights and privileges they lay claim to. In our next we shall publish for their benefit the result of our researches.

TO DO

FOREST OF DEAN (From tlie Monmoulhahire Merlin) »o Sittiirday eventnif the lortittrs cunlinued ihrir work of devasibtion, ar.d in the most resolute manner of their determination to proceed in the task they had imposed upon themselves, and if any obstruction were offered, to repel force by force. These threats, happily for themselves, were not carried into execution. The arrival in Coleford, on Sunday, squadron of the Third Dragoons, with their loaded pistols and carabines—their naked swords glittering in the sun their limbs Herculean mould —and their dashing military appearance, struck terror into the hearts of the bravest. These troops were reinforced on Monday morning by a large detachment of the 11th regiment of Foot. On Sunday evening the Duke of Beaufort and the Marquis of Worcester arrived at Troy, and on the following morning proceeded Coleford, where they were met by Sir T. C. Boevey, the High Sheriff of Gloucestershire, and a large party of magistrates. At eleven o'clock a detachment of Dragoons, of the infantry, under the command of Major Mackworth, a large body of keepers, two the London police estahlishment, accompanied body of magistrates and gentlemen, amongst the foremost of whom was the Marquis Worcester, moved off for the forest, and scoured the country in the direction of Parkcnd and Bream. In this entire district, which presented such a busy scene last week, scarcely a human being was to seen. This force returned Coleford at five o’clock, having captured seven prisoners, who were identified having been employed in tearing down the fences. About this time an alarm reached the magis. traies that the foresters had assembled in considerable force on the Ruardtan.hill, and were engaged in destroying the remaining embankments. A troop of Dragoons was immediately despatched that quarter, but their very appearance in the distance frightened the levellers, and before the Dragoons reached the work of destruction not a man was to be seen. James, the instigator of the whole proceedings, was apprehended Wednesday. On his examination before the magistrates he was very dogged and sullen. was therefore committed Gloucester gaol take his trial at the next assizes. A man named Birr, who, with two or three of his sous, had been very active in demolishing the inclosures, was also committed at the same time. The rest of the prisoners taken on Monday were admitted hail. About 100 miles of the fences have been either destroyed or damaged, and the estimated expense of repairing them is 50001. The work restoration has already commenced. On Thursday a man named Harris, alias Welshman, alias Poise-foot, another leveller of notoriety, was appreheudtd Watkins, the constable, and two of the forest keepers. When discovered and summoned surrender, be brandished large knife, and swore that he would be the death of any man who might venture to approach him. The constable and ketpers immediately rushed upon and disarmed him. While they were conducting him before the magistrates, he contrived, without being perceived, to draw from his pocket pistol, which placed close to the ear of the constable and snapped. The pistol fortunately missed lire, otherwise Waikins must have been a dead man ; for, on being taken from him, it was found loaded up to the muzzle. For this attempt at assassination the ruffian has been committed take his trial at the next Gloucester assizes. A general impression has gone forth that Mr. Ma. chen, with previous knowledge of the intentions of the foresters to destroy the iuclosures. took no steps to prevent them from accomplishing their object ; that in the first instance there were but forty or fifty levellers employed ; and that with a few constables might have stilled the mischief in its birth. This is altogether a false notion. We are informed by a gentleman who was present on the morning when the demolition commenced, that Mr. hud provided himself with men, upon whose zeal and fidelity he could rely, and were anxious attempt the dispersion the levellers, but the numbers of the latter were much superiur that Mr. Machen would nut allow them to inteifere. The geutleman in question confidently assures us, that in the very outset of the business there were at least men at work—that from 100 to 120 more stood looking on—and that the tops of the neighbouring hills were crowded with people, were hastening to the scene of action. Any attempt disperse the rioters under such circumstances would have been an act of great imprudence, say the least of it. understand that proposal was yesterday made to the magistrates, on the part of the levellers were not assembled on Wednesday se'nnight when the riot act was read, and who did not make themselves conspicuous by pressing others into the illegal service, that they may he absolved from the penalties they have incurred on giving one week’s work, in reparation of the mischief committed.

Evans and Ruffy's Farmer's Journal - Monday 20 June 1831

FOREST OF DEAN. The Government inclosures of this Forest were thrown down about a fortnight since, by a large body of the foresters, who appear to have acted under the impression that the right of commonage reverted to them at the end of 21 years. On Sunday evening two troops of the 3rd Dragoon Guards arrived in Colford from Dorchester, who were joined on Monday morning by the militia staff, pensioners, &c., from this town, amounting to 70 men. The Duke of Beaufort, Lord Lieutenant of the county, the Marquis of Worcester, and several Magistrates, had also assembled; and many gentlemen resident in this town and its vicinity volunteered their services in aid of the authorities. At 11 o'clock a detachment of dragoons, 50 of the infantry, under the command of Major Mackworth, a large body of keepers, two of the London police establishment, accompanied by a body of Magistrates and gentlemen, moved off for the forest, and scowered the country in the direction of Parkend and Bream; in this entire district, which presented such a busy scene last week, scarcely a human being was to be seen. This force returned to Colford at five o'clock, having captured seven prisoners, who were identified as having been employed in tearing down the fences. About this time an alarm reached the Magistrates that the foresters had assembled in considerable force on the Ruardean-hill, and were engaged in destroying the remaining embankments. A troop of dragoons was immediately dispatched to this quarter, but their very appearance in the distance frightened the levellers, and before the dragoons reached the work of destruction, not a man was to be seen. As night was now drawing on, the troop returned to Colford with one prisoner, having previously sent in two others. The 10 prisoners taken, with the exception of two, are young lads scarcely arrived to manhood; after a brief examination before the Magistrates, they were confined in the room above the market house, and a strong guard placed over them.

The little town of Colford was literally filled with strangers, and there appeared the best feeling among these visiters to aid the Magistrates. A strong reaction in the minds of the foresters had already taken place: they are now painfully convinced they have been the dupes of a few bad men, and it is extremely probable, if these leaders have not escaped, the foresters themselves will be active in their apprehension. A sort of offer of compromise was made yesterday, to make a general surrender if bail would be accepted; but this was refused by the Magistrates.

That these leaders have used the names of persona of distinction, to give colour to their proceedings, is clearly ascertained; but it is to be hoped, for their honour, that it will be as clearly proved that they have been used without authority. From a most careful examination of the whole of this unfortunate affair, it would seem, by artifices so improbable as scarcely to be credible, that one man (Warren James,) has effected a combination so complete amidst the foresters, that 4,000 or 5,000 men could be collected by a war-whoop (for literally this was the signal for assemblieg), and had them, when assembled, so completely under control, that his *ipac dixat* for the commission of any act of violence would have been the foresters' warrant for its execution.

The amount of damage is variously estimated; the extent of fencing destroyed is supposed to exceed 60 miles, and its reparation to cost £15,000; and this daniage, leaving out of the question the effect of example in a neighbourhood abounding with newly enclosed lands, and the quantum of suffering which will be inflicted on the agents in this business, might have been prevented by foresight, in providing a small force to suppress the evil at its first development; and there was sufficient time for this, for three days' notice was fairly given, and that to persons officially connected with the forest, of the intention of the levellers.

The accounts from the Monmouthshirc hills are still favourable: the men are at their employ; there have been no assemblages to disturb the peace, and the imagination of the agitators is now almost exhausted in the invention of descriptive accounts of scenes which never existed but in the chimera of a vitiated brain.

FOREST OF DEAN. ARRIVAL OF THE MILITARY-DISPERSION OF THE LEVELLERS AND APPREHENSION OF THE RINGLEADERS. Our account of the proceedings in the Forest of Dean last week was necessarily concluded at a very interesting crisis, like an act in some dramatic entertainment, where the curtain drops upon a scene of great excitement, leaving the imagination upon the fret, until the time arrives for its further development.

TO DO

GLOUCEESTER ASSIZES; (before Mr. Justice PATTESON.)

FOREST OF DEAN RIOTS.

Warren James, a man of extremely respectable appearance, was indicted for the capital offence of remaining with rioters for one hour after the reading of the proclamation contained in the Riot Act.

Mr. JERVIS, Mr. CAMPBELL, Mr. ALEXANDER, and Mr. TALBOT cohducted the prosecution; Mr. C. PHILLIPS and Mr. PHILLPOTTS the defence.

Mr. JERVIS stated that this was a capital offence, and that to make out the case three things must be pro.7ed--hrst, that there was a riot; 2dly, that proclamation t wae ; and 3dly, that the prisoner and others, to the numb'ei . 6f .2 or more, remained together for an hour after such proclamation. It would appear that, by an Act of Parliament, passed is the year 1808, his Majesty was empowered to enclose 11,000 H s cres In the Forest of Dean, and that, when the Commissioners of the Treastr - ry - Were - of opinion that the timber in such enclosures was suffiiently strong net to be injored by cattle, they had the power of throwing down the enclosures, for the benefit of those who had the rights of common. In the month of May the prisoner, who was a free miner, had sent a letter on the behalf of the free mi'llers to the Surveyor-General of the Forest, asking that the indosures should be opened, and consequences insusd as 'detailed by the following witnesses: — Edward Machin, Esq. said, I am a Magistrate ; I am Surveyor-general df the forest of Dean. In consequence of seeing a notice I published another notice or caution, which was generally distributed and circulated. I sent one to the prisoner. I received a letter purporting to come from the prisoner. I saw him on Sunday the sth of June; I said to him "Hew can you think of misleading persons in the way you are doing, you will bring yourself and others into changer; What cab yea Mean by it. He replied—"We are all right, the forest was given up to us in Parliament last year." I replied, "This is so absurd that if you allow yourselves to be drawn on it will be your own fault." The prisoner a:d, "I have the Act of Parliament at home." On the Wednesday following I went to the prisoner's house; I saw him; he was accompanied by about 12 or 14 persons. I asked him how he could continue to mislead the people. I said to him," You tell one person you have an Act, and another,that you have a Charter—lf you have any documents why do you not produce them?" He said, "I have a Charter, and will fetch it." He went to his house for a minute or two, and then returned with a pick-axe on his shoulder; he went towards the Park-hill enclosure, other persons following him. My brother, Mr. Henry Davis, followed theM ; they took up a position on rising ground; we met our special constables at the enclosure, and small parties joined these who were with the prisoner, and they huzzaed as each party joined. The prisoner and party increased to about 200, about 80 of them having spades, pick-axes, and mattocks, which they flourished about. I put myself between the mob aid the enclosure, and forbad them touching the bank. I commanded them in the King's name to disperse. They paid no attention. There were "eighty at work destroying the enclosures. Thinking I was net strong enough, with the woodman, to'slisperse or apprehend them, I took the last volume of "Barn," and read the Riot Act to them. Before I read it, I commanded silence with a land voice ,several times. The persons cried out, "Well done my lads." This was at about half-past seven o'clock in the morning. Al r. Ducarel, a Magistrate, arrived, and I requested him to read the Riot Act again, and he did so. I left them at about a quarter past eight pulling down the tanks. The prisoner was still with them. I returned about ten, and the mob was then about 300 or4oo. I saw the prisoner again in the course of the day, but I do not recollect the particular times. Much damage had been done, and a mile of fencing pulled down. I did not consider it safe to attempt to apprehend any of them, because our constablea were unarmed. I was not alarmed, and did not consider myself in any personal danger as long as they were allowed to pull down the fences. I considered the property in danger.

Cross-examined by Mr. C. PHILLIPS.—The prisoner has always been a peaceable, well conducted man. I received no personal violence of any kind. The special constables were about 40.

The notices stated were read.

Evidence was given that the prisoner continued with the mob nearly the whole of the day.

The prisoner. in his defence, said that he had left the rioters several times in the course of the day.

Mr. Justice PATTESON summed up the evidence.

Verdict—*Guilty*.

Mr. Justice PATTESON informed the prisoner that his life would be spared, but that he must not expect to escape with a very slight punishment, as outrages of this kind must be put a stop to.

There were other charges against the prisoner for rioting on the three following days, but on these Mr. JERVIS declined offering any evidence.
