DISTURBANCES IN MONMOUTHSHIRE.

(From the Gloucester Journal of Monday.)

On Friday last, the 26th instant, a Meeting of the Magistrates and Deputy Lieutenants was held at Usk, which his Grace the Duke of Beaufort, Lord Lieutenant, presided, for the purpose of taking into consideration the disturbed state of the county. The 1st Resolution states, that, "comparing the low prices of provisions with the present average rate of wages paid to the colliers, they are in a much better stale than the labouring classes in general; and that, in the present depressed state of the iron trade, no advance in their wages appears practicable." The remaining Resolutions relate to the measures to be enforced for the maintenance of the peace, and for bringing the refractory to sense of their duty to their employers and families.

A Special Sessions of the County Magistrates was also held at Pontypool, on Friday se'nnight, which, though convened at a very short notice, was numerously attended. A reward of 50 *l.*. was ordered to be offered for the conviction of persons going about in disguise, in women's clothes and with blacked faces, by night, exercising any species of threat or intimidation; a Proclamation was also ordered for preventing or suppressing mendicity; and other energetic and necessary measures for preserving and restoring the peace of the county were adopted.

The preceding night (Thursday) violent attack had been made on a house at Tredegar, in which were some men who still continued at work; as they repelled the violence by fire-arms, one or more of the assailants were wounded, which, it is expected, will lead to their being discovered and taken. Early on Saturday morning a large party of colKers assembled Gelly Haw Colliery, stopping by force and chaining together nineteen waggons laden with coals for the Tredegar Works. Intelligence of this outrage, and complaint having been made to J. H. Moggridge, Esq. the neighbouring Magistrate, he instantly repaired to the spot, accompanied by Capt. Lewis's troop of Yeomanry Cavalry, who were at the time breakfasting at Woodfield. Every endeavour to dissuade the misguided workmen from their illegal purpose, and every warning of danger and friendly exhortation proving vain, the Riot Act was read, and the consequences of remaining together after the expiration of an hour or of any previous breach of the peace, fully explained. In less than 20 minutes, however, a general attack was made on the waggons in the rear, and the coals were thrown out; upon which, hoping still to avoid the painful alternative of ordering the cavalry to charge, the Magistrate seized one of the ringleaders; but, after some resistance, he was rescued, and the cavalry were then ordered to clear the ground, which was effected in few minutes, with equal celerity and humanity, not a single individual being even wounded. The waggons were then forwarded under guard of the cavalry, and, together with 55 others, making in the whole 74 waggons, were conveyed, notwithstanding repeated attempts to break up the roads in advance, to within three miles of the Tredegar Works, where they were met by a detachment of the Scots Greys, under Capt. Wyndham, accompanied by the Vicar of Abergavenny.

Deserting Farms.—The desertion of farms by their occupiers, after a thorough clearance of the property, is beginning to be very alarming in part of Monmouthshire. It is an absolute fact that two Magistrates, residing in that county, travelled eighteen miles on Saturday se'nnighl to give possession to the landlord of a deserted farm, and in order to complete the business, they must travel as many more! The same Magistrates had the mortification to learn as they went along, that several other tenants in that part of the county had already done the same thing!

Bristol Mercury - Saturday 27 April 1822

CAUSE OF THE DISTURBANCES IN THE GREAT MINING DISTRICTS.

The Country has now, unfortunately in more parts than one, an opportunity of practically proving the justice of the recent opinion, so authoritatively pronounced by Lord Londonderry, as to the *advantages of low wages*, as well as of the truth of his assertion, that *"all classes were in a stale of prosperity, excepting the agricultural."* The state to which his Lordship and his colleagues have reduced the Countrv, compels the manufacturer to reduce the prices of labour; for, if he sells the product of his manufacture at all, he must sell it at low prices, and to do this he must manufacture cheaply; consequently labour (the cost of which forms so material a part of the value of manufactured articles) must be had at low prices.

Lord Londonderry's maxim in favour of low wages could not have come more ungraciously out ofthe mouth of any living being; for *he* has been, above all others of the present day, the man who, by laying immense burdens on the Country, has rendered it IMPOSSIBLE *for the labourer to subsist an LOW wages*. The fact is, the taxes, *seen* and *unseen*, *direct* and *indirect* (the latter, be it ever remembered, vastly more onerous than the former), take so much from every man's labour and income in this country, as either to cripple his means, or wholly to deprive him of the ability to live in any sort of comfort or ease without enormous wages, or a great income from some source or other. Under these circumstances, the Iron-Masters (for, although the argument bears alike on other manufacturers, the dreadful situation of the great Mining Districts of the kingdom preferablv claims our more immediate attention), finding that they must either sell their iron, when made, at a price lower than ever before known, or not at all, have (since the months of June or July last) made, or attempted to make, some two, and others three, distinct reductions in the wages of their workmen; and, great as must be the amount of these reductions, we are not aware that it is at all disproportionate to the necessities of their case; on the contrary, if the price of iron should not rise, of which permanently there is very little room to hope, it is well understood that still other reductions in the expense of making iron must take place, or the works cannot be carried on but at a loss, and consequently cannot be expected long to be carried on at all, at least to any thing like their present extent. Here then exists an absolute necessity for *low-priced labour*; and feeling this, not only from the exercise of their common sense, but from experimental suffering (for we have heard, from authority which we have no reason to doubt, that great losses were endured by several very respectable Iron-Masters last year; and it is known too well, that absolute stoppages of others in the central Mining Districts have actually taken place) the Iron-Masters generally have endeavoured to reduce the wages of their workmen accordingly; and what has been the consequence, the deplorable state of Staffordshire, Shropshire, Monmouthshire, and South Wales, forcibly proclaims in a language which goes at once to the heart and to the understanding of every one.

For these consequences, *where they are the result solely of low wages*, the masters are not answerable. It is the work of necessity on their part; and, in a natural and healthy state of the country, moderately low wages may be desirable; because the extent of the sale of the manufactured article, next to its goodness, depends upon its cheapness; but it may be, and it certainly is, that man may he oppressed by such a rate of wages as alone the manufacturer can afford to pay, or that it is the interest of the manufacture itself should be given;—but then this is solely caused by the effect of measures emanating from a bad administration of public affairs.

Where Government takes a great proportion of the proceeds of labour and of the income of property to its own use, it follows that by *so much* the *less* remains for the use of the individuals who compose the aggregate of the society so *mis*-governed. Thus to apply this indubitable principle in political economy to the present unhappy case of the labouring poor in this country, it was admitted by a very acute disciple of the Pitt school of politics, but who from woful experience came at length to doubt the infallibility of its principles; and who was himself at the time in Parliament, that considerably more than one half of the wages of every poor man's labour went in taxes; and the accuracy of this statement has not only never been disproved, but is capable of defying disproof. There is no doubt it is so. It is not because the tax-gatherer and the titheman do not call periodically at the door of the labourer for assessed taxes, and for a tenth part of the produce of the earth, that he therefore does not pay taxes, and tithes, and poor-rates too; though he may be even discharged from the poor-rate by the humane consideration of the magistrates. The poorest labourer pays all these burdens in the increased price of the provisions and necessaries of life; not an article of food goes into his mouth, not a particle of raiment clothes his back, but he pays so much the more for them all than he would if there were no taxes, no tithes, no poor-rates; and therefore he contributes in reality and in fact to all these public burdens, and enormously too, as Mr. Preston has demonstrated; for, as the Duke of Bedford said at the late Cambridge County Meeting, with truth unquestionable, *There was scarcely a thing but what was under the gripe of the excise-man or the tax collector; even the very light of heaven was doubly taxed; first in the manufacture of the glass, and then in the assessed taxes. The poor man, who creeps into his hovel, is taxed for the candle, the miserable candle, that lights him to his pallet. Thus it is,"* as the Noble Duke added, *"that taxation takes hold of every thing;"* and thus it is that taxation, by taking hold of the poor man's scanty means, renders low wages totally unequal to the decent support of himself and family.

These are truths which in the present state of things it behoves no one to be ignorant of; but above all men, *that Which their workmen at present FEEL*, it behoves the Iron-Masters to *know*. The alarming situation of the Mining Districts arises not mainly out of the fault either of the master or the man, but out of the present dreadfully over-burdened state of the country, which will not permit on the one hand the labourer to exist on *low* wages, and which at the same time will not admit of the master selling the produce of his works at such price as will enable him to afford *high* wages. It follows then, necessarilv, that it is the real interest of the Iron-Master to promote such retrenchment and reform as will relieve the country of a large proportion of its public burdns; and the master-key to all these is such a *Reform in the Representation of the People in the Commons House of Parliament* as will restore Parliaments to their shorter term of duration in better times, and extend the elective franchise so as to make the exercise of it more like what it was in the happier days of our forefathers, and a more equitable resemblance of that which the Constitution intended, and which it is the inalienable right of Britons to enjoy. For taxation without representation is not only, what Lord Chathamn called it, "TYRANNY," but it will also in the end be found to be the Most MISTAKEN AND MISCHIEVOUS POLICY.

The Mining Districts of Staffordshire and Shropshire are reported to be, in some respects, even in a worse situation than those of Monmouthihire and South Wales; and in the Forest of Dean disturbances are said to have broken out.

Monmouthshire Merlin - Saturday 26 June 1830

*To the Editor of the Monmouthshire Merlin.*

SIR,— You have lately adverted to a Bill brought into Parliament bv Lord Lowther, in order to revise and correct the laws of the Forest of Dean, which were framed nearly a century ago.— That this Bill is much needed for the convenience of all parties within its operation, I think the following facts, which occurred on Wednesday se'nnight, produce an ample illustration:—

A dispute having arisen between two parties claiming the same property or right of working under the Forest Laws, one of them felt it right to apprehend eight of the workmen employed by the other and under his construction of these nondescript laws, to cause them to be sent to Little Dean Gaol handcuffed, where they lay until the following morning. The other disputant then made his appearance, when the same magistrates, who, the previous night, felt it impossible even to admit the men to bail, discharged the whole without any recognizance whatever, although the depositions on which the men were imprisoned were *fully allowed by their employer*.

Now I do not mean to censure the conduct of the magistrates who thus conducted themselves, for I am convinced they acted under the best impulses on both occasions, but, I decidedly demur to the continuance of laws in so important a place as the Forest of Dean is now become, which are open at different times to constructions and results, as opposed as night and day. If laws are not intelligible and clearly defined, instead of producing the rational object of their creation they produce the precise converse effect— *exparte* construction and consequent bickering and litigation. I shall be glad therefore to see this Bill in full work for the removal of these discrepancies, because there can be no doubt that thereby the unanimity and prosperity of the Foresters will be essentially promoted.

I have no doubt the magistrates, in their ultimate decision on this occasion, construed a complex and vague set of bye-laws, under the influences of that broad and liberal spirit which quadrates at once with the best axioms of the constitution, and the dictates of humanity. I am, Sir, your's, &c. 17th June, 1830. W. B.

Monmouthshire Merlin - Saturday 01 January 1831

FOREST OF DEAN. To the Editor of the Monmouthshire Merlin.

Sir,— Whilst the greatest part of the kingdom are now labouring under great degrees of excitement, I have to exult in being a resident in the most peaceable part of the king's dominions; for altho' the inhabitants are Foresters (a term of terror to some timid persons who are not acquainted with their real character), we have not had a single instance of incendiarism, disloyalty, rebellion, or riot, in any town, village, or hamlet between the rivers Severn and Wye, whilst our neighbours on every side have had repeated acts of diabolical pursuits. Although there are many thousands of the labouring classes suffering great and severe privations from the general distress, there still is not to be found in any class (and I am in the habit of visiting all classes daily) an instance of strife-stirring persuasion; they generally and universally hold the unpardonable incendiaries in the greatest abhorrence. It is true they have lost many valuable local privileges through their apathy, but they possess too much of the real British character to run into rashness and riot, under the mistaken notion of bettering their condition. Indeed their peaceable demeanour, and truly praiseworthy decorum, at this period of general excitement, entitles them justly to public congratulation; and I will assert, Mr. Editor, without the fear of contradiction (for I travel at all hours), that although the Forest of Dean appears to the eye of the stranger a wild and dreary place, still the most timid may travel either by night or day, from Sabrina to Vaga, or from East to West of this immense track of land, without the fear of robbery, riot, or molestation, and with much greater safety than any of the streets of London, Bristol, or their suburbs. A case of highway robbery is not known among us, and the few, very few cases of burglary that have happened have been committed by strangers and adepts in the felonious calling; but should we be visited by any of the Swingites, depend upon it, Mr. Editor, the Foresters will give a long pull, a strong pull, and a pull altogether, to stop the unprincipled marauder and the vile disturber of public tranquillity. But, thank God, sir, we want no military visitors, no yeomanry police, no special constables. We are, Mr. Editor, poor, poor, very poor but we are also quiet, quiet, very quiet.

I am, Mr. Editor, your most obedient servant, Forest of Dean, Dec. 29, 1830. ACORNPATCH

Riots in the Forest of Dean

"Monmouth, Friday Morning.

"There is at present a strong popular excitement in the Forest of Dean. A great portion of the Forest was enclosed and planted with oak, under an Act passed in 48th of George III., which plantations are now in a thriving state. The act provides that 11,000 acres are always to be kept inclosed as a nursery for timber: and that the nursery can only be legally opened by order of the Lords of the Treasury,  and that only when the young timber shall be safe for the browsing of the cattle, sheep, and swine. An erroneous opinion, however, prevails among the foresters, that the inclosures should' be thrown open at the expiration of 21 years, and as the Act was passed in 1808 several of the enclosures are of a longer standing, and great dissatisfaction has been for some time felt at their continuance, and about a fortnight since a portion of the embankment was secretly destroyed. A large reward was offered for the discovery of the offenders, without effect, and hand bills were circulated, cautioning against the recurrence of similar outrages. On Wednesday morning a body of men, about eighty commenced levelling the embankments. In the course of the day their numbers increased to 500. On Thursday they continued the work of devastation, and their numbers increased to 2,000, parties being sent out in all directions to compel the colliers and other workmen to come and assist in opening the enclosures. Several miles of fences were levelled in these two days. The men worked regularly with suitable implements. Thev offered no injury to persons or private property, and were particularly careful of the young timber. There was no military force in the neighbourhood beyond a body of about 50 men, consisting of the staff of the Monmouth Militia and a recruiting party. This small body marched towards the forest on Friday morning. There is no political feeling mixed up with the question of supposed local rights. There are reformers and anti reformers both amongst the foresters, and amongst those who were using their best endeavours to check their proceedings. The accounts from Merthyr continue favourable. The men have returned to their work. Mr. Crawshay's family have returned home–a strong indication of the restoration of order. The number killed, as gathered from the best information, is stated at seventeen or eighteen, including those who have died of their wounds."

Extract of a letter from Pontypool, Monmouthshire received in Shrewsbury yesterday by a tradesman, to whom are indebted tor the information it conveys:–

"Pontypool, Tuesday Morning, Two o'Clock.

"An old man has just come running in, sweating and breathless, to say that the rioters were at Nantyglo, nine miles from here. He had escaped from them. If they catch any that refuse to join them they cut off iheir ears. They are now two miles from here at Abersychan and much mischief is expected. They have threatened to pull down an iron master's house; and this town is all up in arms expecting the worst. It is said there are more than six thousand on their way here. The mob have taken several cannon, made a temporary battery, mounted tor regular siege; and built walls across the roads as high as a house. They are gathered from all quarters for a struggle."

There may be some little exaggeration, arising from personal fear, in the above letter. His Majesty's Ministers have given directions to the troops and soldiers in the vicinity, to march to the spot; and have no doubt the affair will soon be ended. What can misguided combinations of workmen expect, but misery, poverty, and death, as the result of such combinations?–*Shreswbury Chronicle.*

https://britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000928/18310716/027/0004
Monmouthshire Merlin - Saturday 16 July 1831

To the Editor of the Monmouthshire Merlin. SIR,—The "Rights" of the Dean Forest miners to work the coal mines were given them by King Edward the First, on their return from the siege and capture of Berwick, and about the same period in which he granted similar rights to the inhabitants of the Mendip Hills and the High Peak of Derby.

"The Dean Forest Rights" are "That any person born in the hundred of St. Briavel's, who works a year and a day in the mines, becomes a free miner, and has a right to ask the gaveller to set him out a work on the spot he chooses, provided it is not before occupied."

"That the King may send a sixth man to work for his benefit after the mine is opened, for doing which timber is to be allotted from the Forest."

In practice, the right of the King's miner has been compromised for a small payment in money, and the railway acts prohibit the miners, who receive the timber, from using the railways, which has led to a discontinuance of the claim, and which would have been fully requited by the repeal of the Coast Tax on passing the Railway Act, and without any loss to the revenue.

Where the shafts and levels for opening the mines are not deep, long, and expensive, the working miners generally execute them with their own funds but when they are deep as a 100 yards or more, and are expensive, strangers of capital usually buy the gales of the miners and if they did not, they would be useless for want of means to open them. The working of the mines is regulated by rules ordained in the Mine-law Court, which are printed.

In consequence of the great distresses of the Forest in 1795 and in 1801, very similar to those prevailing now in Ireland, many persons, and they were strangers only, promoted the railroads at an immense expense, with the view of finding employment for the miners, and considerable benefit has arisen from them. The price of coal at Hereford, Ross, Gloucester, Cheltenham, and up the canals to Oxford and Reading, has been reduced a third but the non-repeal of the Coast Tax on the Severn, as was expected before for twenty years, and other designed injuries to the trade, have rendered both the railways and deep coal mines very injurious to their promoters, and in consequence the payments to the workmen have been much less than a good trade on the Severn would have afforded to the amount of many thousands a year.

Of these railways, that to Monmouth was pressed with great earnestness (and Mr. Cockshoot, the engineer, who was sent for to review it, said that he had never seen half as much trouble taken with any thing), and was laid out and approved by the government as a continuance of the Lydney Road up Dark Hill, straight through Milk Wall Farm into Coleford town, and in the present course of the rail-road, from Staunton Lane on the backs of the houses, and to their great inconveniencé along the whole length of Coleford town into Monmouth, from which it would have been continued to Abergavenny, and there have met the Brecon Canal, the Blaenavon, Merthyr, and Pontypool Railways, and have rendered this rail-road the course of transit for all the merchandise which now goes down the Severn by Lydney circuitously into the countries connected with those great establishments, and would have supplied full work and employment for twice the ancient number of Forest coal carriers to Monmouth. This, however, has been prevented the railway is not continued from Dark Hill to Coleford, nor into Monmputh town, where little coal fit to burn is brought on the rail-road, when the very best coal might have been brought from the pits in Dark Hill, purchased on purpose.

The poor Coleford carriers have lost the employment which formerly procured food for a hundred souls. The pasture land about Coleford, on which the horses were kept, is greatly reduced in price, and the improvement of the hundred of Skenfrith from Rockfield, upwards of five pounds an acre, and an abundant supply of fuel for the poor at a cheap rate, are entirely lost, as is also the greatest improvement which the towns of Coleford and Monmouth could possibly have received, as the daily communication through Lydney to the Bristol, the Berkeley, and the Stroud Canals, would have established an intercourse with Gloucester, Cheltenham, and the whole interior of the kingdom, and have brought the whole inhabitancy of the Forest to Coleford and Monmouth shops and markets.

I have heard it frequently and gravely asserted, and I fully believe it, that the loss to Monmouth town by the non-completion of the rail-road, as first proposed, will in thirty-six years added to the eighteen years which have passed, amount to more than will buy the freehold of the whole town and it certainly has produced a loss in the rail-road shares of one half at their present price below par.

How far you, sir, may be able to set the completion of this measure in motion I cannot say, but it is a melancholy thing for the public, as well as to the inhabitants of Coleford, to see so obvious a benefit destroyed.

I trouble you with this note in consequence of your frequent allusions to the Forest Rights, and to state some of the causes of the melancholy events which have lately happened,—for hunger will break through stone walls. I am, sir, your humble servant, AN INJURED MINER. Coleford, 8th July, 1831.

:class: dropdown

https://britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0001316/18310615/001/0001
Evening Mail - Wednesday 15 June 1831

(From the *Monmouthshore Merlin*.)

We shall commence by taking a review of the claim out of which their late tumultuous proceedings have originated. It appears that from time immemorial certain inhabitants of the Forest have exercised a right of common of pasture, and of pannage, through certain districts. By an act of the 20th of Charles II, c. 3, after reciting that the wood and timber of the forest, which of late years was of very great quantity and value, within the Forest of Dean, was become totally destroyed (except as therein is mentioned), whereby there was an apparant scarcity of timber there, as in all other parts of the kingdom, so that some course was necessary to be speedily taken to restore and preserve the growth of timber for the future support of His Majesty's navy and the maintenance of shipping for the trade of the nation,—it was enacted that 11,000 acres, statute measure, at 16½ feet to the perch, of the said Forest should be enclosed, and remain so enclosed, until the Lord Treasurer, the Commissioners of the Treasury, or the Chancellor of the Exchequer should be satisfied that the trees growing on the said 11,000 acres were become past danger of the browsing of deer, cattle, or other prejudice, and should think fit to lay open the same, or any part thereof, consisting of 500 acres or more; and that in such case it should be lawful for His Majesty, in lieu of so much of the said 11,000 acres as should be laid open, to enclose the like quantity out of any other part of the forest wastes. A clause in the same act makes void any estate or interest in the forest lands which might be thereafter obtained by any person from the Crown. Another clause gives to the owners and occupiers of forest lands, as a compensation in lieu of the right of common and of herbage, taken from them by the before-mentioned enclosures, the privilege of cutting down and selling for their own use any timber growing upon their several lands; and also the privilege of improving, enclosing, fencing, and building on said lands—of keeping dogs—and of hunting and killing beasts of chase and other game. The 11th section saves the liberties and privileges of all persons in and through the said forest at such times as the same should not be enclosed, and provides how the right of pannage and of common pasture should thereafter be enjoyed. An act of the 48th Geo. III, c. 72, confirms the before-mentioned statute of Charles II. in all its essential particulars, and directs how persons wilfully destroying any of the fences or enclosures shall be punished. The third offence is made felony, and subjected to seven years' transportation, fine, or imprisonment, at the discretion of the judge before whom the offender may be tried.

In pursuance of the foregoing acts of Parliament, we understand that 11,000 acres have been regularly enclosed. Some evil genius lately suggested to the foresters that the enclosures were not legal, and that they would be justified in destroying them. The credulous foresters gave ear to the tempter, and immediately proceeded to act on his suggestion. On the night of Saturday, the 21st of May, part of the fence of an enclosure, called Oaken Hill, was thrown down, and the gates of that and other enclosures entirely demolished. A reward of 50 guineas having been offered by Mr. Machen for the discovery of the offenders, an old collier, named James, went, we are told, to that gentleman and claimed the reward by declaring that he and his three sons had done the mischief. Similar nightly acts of destruction were continued until Wednesday morning last, when several hundreds of the foresters assembled at an early hour, with the avowed purpose of levelling all the fences throughout the forest. The magistrates, hearing of their intentions, went out to meet them before they had commenced their illegal proceedings, and having in vain endeavoured to dissuade them from their purpose, read the riot act. There being no military on the spot, the foresters laughed at the proceeding, and began the work of ruin, in which they laboured with as much zeal and ardour as if their lives depended upon its speedy execution. This lawless system was continued during the whole of Wednesday and until Thursday night, by which time several miles of the enclosures were prostrated. On Wednesday one of the magistrates went to Merthyr for some soldiers. He returned by the mail on Thursday, with Major Mackworth, but none of the military could, it seems, be spared from Merthyr. Between 6 and 7 o'clock yesterday morning, the staff of the Militia, and a recruiting party of Marines stationed in Monmouth, together with the pensioners residing in the town and neighbourhood (the whole group not exceeding 34 in number), marched well armed for the scene of action.  Expectation is on the tip-toe to learn the result of their expedition, but no tidings have arrived. The foresters as yet have confined themselves to the destruction of the fences: their language up to this time being— "Do not molest us in our object, and we will not molest you. Bring the soldiers against us, and we will repel force with force—spill our blood, and yours shall be spilt."

We do not hesitate to declare that the man who has taken so much pains to delude these simple and naturally unoffending creatures is no better than a demon—one of those Afrites we read of in Eastern story, whose delight consists in scourging and afflicting the human race. We invite the poor deluded men to come to us for advice. If any of their just rights are withheld, we pledge ourselves to leave no stone unturned to obtain for them what they are entitled to. The benefit of our legal experience, and of our abilities, such as they are, shall be gratuitously at their service. Let them not listen to the seductive promises of wretches whose sole object it is to make tools of them for their own purposes, and who, to gain what they seek, would be the first to consign their dupes to the dungeon and the scaffold!

FRIDAY, 10 o'CLOCK.—We have just had a long conversation with a gentleman from the Forest, who has instructed us in some particulars that may not be uninteresting to our readers. The soldiers who left Monmouth this morning had established a sort of garrison in the market-house of Coleford. They had not attempted to take any hostile proceedings against the levellers, but warrants had been issued for the apprehension of the ringleaders, and it was expected they would surrender without opposition. The man, named Warren James, to whom we have before alluded, is the chief instigator and director of the proceedings. The story goes, that through some nobleman in London, he has discovered an old charter or act of Parliament, giving certain rights to the foresters, of which they can never be deprived. One of the foresters told our informant on Tuesday that it "was a document of undoubted authenticity, having been signed by seven English kings, among whom was his late Majesty George IV., who affixed his signature to it just before he died." The same man acquainted our informant of what was intended to be done on the Wednesday morning, when the work of destruction commenced; and the whole came to pass exactly as he had predicted. James and a large party of his companions assembled at Whitemead Park, declaring their intention to level the fences. Mr. Machen and several other gentlemen went out to remonstrate with them, explaining the acts of Parliament under which the enclosures had taken place, and inquiring to know by what act or *acts* of Parliament they professed to make out their claim. James said he would go and fetch the acts on which the rights of himself and associates were founded. He accordingly disappeared for a few minutes, and, returning with a face of the most imperturbable gravity, produced, as the vouchers of his privileges, an enormous pick-*axe*. Finding that they could do nothing with the mob, and not having sufficient force, civil or military, to restrain their proceedings, the magistrates went away, on which James sent for a constable, and in his presence superintended the work of destruction, observing that he had sent for him to keep the peace. James is one of those men who, by some means or other, has got a smattering of legal terms and phrases, from the general use of which, and of a great degree of natural shrewdness, he has obtained the nickname of "The counsellor." His fate will most assuredly prove "a little knowledge is a dangerous thing." It will be seen by our former statement that the enclosure of the forest was directed for national purposes. Without the oak nursery we can have no timber—without the timber no ships—and without ships, alas for Great Britain, the gem of the sea! By the statute of Charles II., the rights of the foresters to pannage and pasturage in the whole forest are admitted, and privileges are reserved in compensation for those of which by the enclosure they would be deprived. This arrangement appears to have been fair and equitable.

Nearly two centuries have passed since it was entered into, and no opposition has, up to this time, been raised against it. We wish not to take the part of the strong against the weak—of the rich against the poor—of the government against the people; but we are convinced that on this occasion the foresters are in the wrong, and we tell them so because we are their real friends. We know, as we said before, that they are naturally inoffensive. Let them open their eyes, let them use the common sense with which they are endowed, and they will see at once how grievously they have been misled. If James had been in possession of any legal authority for his proceedings, why did he not produce it to Mr. Machen? A pick-axe wielded by a strong arm is not an emblem of equity or justice, but of force and violence. Let the levellers look at
the mischief they have done. Thousands of young thriving trees, the pride and earnest of future protection to the soil from which they sprung, will be destroyed, without any corresponding advantage to the authors of the mischief. The parts enclosed are almost overgrown with briars and weeds, and for some time will afford little, if any, herbage to the cattle. Before the foresters can derive any benefit from the
pasturage, the fences will be restored; and the only reward for the labour of those who may escape unpunished will be the miserable reflection that they have added to the burdens and diminished the resources of their impoverished country.

(From a Correspondent of the *Globe*.)  
MONMOUTH, Sunday Morning.

The small force collected in this town on Friday morning returned last night from Colford, without having made any attempt to stop the levellers in their work of destruction, which was pursued with renewed avidity the whole of Friday and Saturday, and the entire of the enclosures are now open; or where the walling or embankment is not completely down, gaps or breaches of about 100 yards are made at intervals of
the same length; on Friday there was the greatest display of strength, and at least 3,000 men were engaged in gangs, varying in number from 50 to 300, throughout every portion of the forest. It would almost exceed belief, that in the open day such a number should assemble, their persons and residences in numberless instances known to the magistrates, gentry, and keepers, and that no force has been assembled to resist outrage so flagrant; nearly 50 miles of substantial mounds and walling have been levelled in the short space of four days, and upwards of 10,000 acres of fine young timber, of about 20 years' growth, laid open. There is some movement in this business which demands prompt and strict investigation. The writer of this conversed with two men who were pressed on Thursday, and compelled to assist in throwing down the banks, and it is evident from their report, that the great majority of the foresters believe that Warren James, their openly avowed leader, whose name is affixed to the handbill calling the meeting to lay open the enclosures, and who is the O'Connell of the forest, is but the agent of some one or more noblemen
in town, who are determined "to see the foresters righted." It would not be prudent or just to use the names of the parties mentioned, for perhaps it is a licence taken by the leaders of the rioters without authority. A sister of James's, it is said, lives with a nobleman, who the foresters expect will be in the forests shortly again, and James has been twice to town to have interviews on this business; one fact is evident, that the poor men are acting under the impression that they are committing no illegal act, and that no resistance will be offered them, and the events of the past week prove their view in the latter instance to be correct. There is another singular feature in this business worthy attention: the different parties were accompanied by carts containing provisions, and hogsheads of cider were distributed to the men in the progress of the work. The only instance of outrage beyond the primary object of the foresters is the pulling down the garden walls of Mr. Goold, accompanied with a promise of serving his house in the same manner, and occasional threats of personal violence to any persons who they judge are put as spies to their conduct. Whether these disturbances are to end here, time only will develop; some of the more violent are for proceeding to other acts of violence; the railways which intersect the forest in every direction, and the turnpike gates, are rumoured to be the next objects of attack, but the leaders appear to consider that the work for which they assembled was finished last night. The only shadow of a question of right appears to be, that the act provides that only 11,000 acres, together with a small quantity of about 500 or 600 acres previously enclosed, shall be kept as a nursery for timber; now the foresters declare that considerably more have been enclosed. Their assertion that the timber is of sufficient stature not to require protection is untrue; the most experienced woodwards, totally unconnected with the Crown lands, agree that the embankments should be kept up from seven to ten years yet to come. Be this as it may, the uninterrupted progress of the foresters during the last week cannot but have an injurious effect on the bad spirits on the Monmouthshire and Welch hills, and the events of the coming week are looked forward to with considerable anxiety.

Since writing the above, the militia staff, &c., have just received orders to be in readiness to-morrow morning at 5 o'clock. Their number will be increased by several volunteers.

Here is the text extracted from the 19th century newspaper scan:

APPREHENSION OF PENDERRIN.—A letter from Merthyr, dated Wednesday night, says—"Lewis, the huntsman," the most desperate of the Merthyr rioters, was apprehended on the 7th, in a wood, in the parish of Penderrin, Breconshire, where he had concealed himself. Information was immediately sent, by express, from M. Morgan, Esq., a Breconshire magistrate, to J. B. Bruce, Esq., at Penydarran, who immediately despatched a post-chaise to bring him to Merthyr. As the escort had to pass over the hills where some of the yeomanry had been disarmed, and through the Hirwain Iron Works, at night, Mr. Franklin, with the same gallantry which he has displayed through the whole of these riots, volunteered to go with a party of 12 of his troop, to escort the prisoner. Mr. Nicholl, of Merthyr-mawr (who had only arrived that evening from London), Mr. Lloyd Watkins, of Penneyre, Colonel Bush, and Mr. W. Crawshay, also accompanied the escort, and this sanguinary ruffian was brought in safety to the guard-house. Evan Thomas, Esq., of Sully (who has in the most handsome manner volunteered his services in assisting the magistrates of the hundred) sat with J. B. Bruce, Esq., and the Rev. George Thomas, and were occupied eight hours in getting through the examination of this prisoner alone. We are told there is no doubt of his full committal.—*Cambrian.*

Nottingham Review - Friday 17 June 1831

TO DO
RIOTS IN THE FOREST DEAN Monmouth, Friday.— The inhabitants of this town and neighbourhood had scarcely recovered from the anxiety necessarily attendant the result of the tumult at Merthyr, when their attention was draw n to another popular display of feeling Parkend, in the forest of Dean, distant seven miles from this town. A great portion of this extensive forest was, by the Geo. 111. cap. 72, inclosed and planted with oak, and which plantations are now in a thriving state of luxuriance; this act provides that eleven thousand acres are always to be kept inclosed as a nursery for the timber. An opinion generally prevails amongst the foresters that these inclosures should have been thrown open at the expiration of twenty-one years, and as the act was passed in there are several inclosures which have been fenced for a longer period; but a reference to the act must have convinced these poor men of their error, for a section therein provides that the fences can only be legally opened by order of the Lords of the Treasury, and that at a period when the young timber shall be safe from the browsing of the cattle, sheep, and swine, which the inhabitants are in the custom of driving tack. There have been several meetings of the foresters respecting these inclosures, and about fortnight since a portion of embankment was secretly destroyed at Oaken-hill; this caused a large reward to be offered for the discovery of the offenders, without effect, and as it was generally un. derstood that some manifestation of feeling was to be displayed this week, precautionary hand bills, signed by Edward Maehen, Esq., a gentleman much respected, and who holds an official situation in the forest, were circulated; but, regardless of the consequences, on Wednesday morning, a body of men, at first about 80, but whose numbers were increased in the course of the day to 400 or 500, commenced the opening of the inclosures by levelling the embankments. On Thursday, this work of devastation w-as renewed and, it is said, before the close of yesterday near were industriously engaged in the work. The men are provided with tools; they offer no violence to the persons properties of the neighbourhood, and not injure the young timber. There are many contradictory reports of the extent of damage, and it would not prudent to state an opinion founded on rumour; but it is certain that several miles in length of fences w ere destroyed in these two days. The collieries were stopped yesterday, and parties were sent out in all directions to compel the foresters, who prudently abstained from this illegal work, to lend a helping hand until every enclosure in the forest was opened. We have no force in this immediate neighborhood, to resist this singular yet daring violation of the law', beyond a body of about fifty men, which assembled this morning, consisting of the Monmouth Militia Staff, marine recruiting party, and pensioners, who marched at six o'clock for Colford, where it is reported they are to be met a similar force from Gloucester from the known determined character of the foresters, and their acquaintance with the intricacies of the forest, much alarm is manifested for the safety of this handful of men. In this case, well as at Merthyr, no general political feeling is mixed up with the question of supposed local right or grivance. Reformers and anti reformers are alike mixed up with the rioters, and men who a few weeks since were the most widely opposed in the political feeling of a contested election, arc now united in the suppression of these disturbances."

Morning Chronicle - Tuesday 14 June 1831

TUMULTUOUS ASSEMBLAGES IN THE FOREST OF DEAN, AND DESTRUCTION OF THE GOVERNMENT INCLOSURES.

[FROM THE MONMOUTHSHIRE MERLIN.]

It has seldom, perhaps never, fallen to the lot of any provincial journalist to have to record, at the same time, two instances of alarming riot ill his own immediate neighboourhood. Such, however, is now our painful duty. Three or four months ago we inserted a letter, unIder the signature of "Acornpatch," in which, after explaining the condition of the people in the Forest of Dean, the writer emphatically says—'We are poor, poor, very poor; but We ale quiet, quiet, very quiet.' The character thus given of the foresters was at that period most strictly true. Although suffering the greatest distress and privations—although contiiually excited to acts of tumult and disorder by Swingites and Cobbetites without number, they remained firm in their allegiance to the King and to the laws, and never for a moment fell away from that feeling of patriotism, whose still smnall voice is ever whispering in the ears of an honest man, that it is better to endure every kind of misery and hardship in unstained loyalty, than to light the torch of discord, and be the cause of blioodsbed and desolation in the land of his birth. We feel persuaded that the foresters have always hitherto acted upon this principle, and that but for a delusion, into which they have been led by the artifices of designing men, we should not now have to relate occurrences, which seem for the first time to throw a shade upon their peaceableness and patriotism.

We shall commence by taking a review of the claim out of which their late tumultuous proceedings have originated. It appears that from time immemorial certain inhabitants of the Forest have exercised a right of common, of pasture, and of pannage through certain districts. By an Act of the 20th. of Charles II., c. 3, after reciting that the wood and timber (of the Crown, which of late years was of very great quantity and value within the Fo- rest of Dean, was become totally destroyed (except as therein is mentioned), whereby there was an apparent scarcity of timber there, as in all ather parts of the kingdom, so that some course was necessary to be speedily taken to restore and preserve the growth of timber for the future support of his Majesty's navy and the maintenance of shipping for the trade of the nation—it was enacted that 11,000 acres, statute measure, at 16 1/2 feet to the perch, of the said Forest, should he enclosed, and remain so enclosed until the Lord Treasurer, the Commissioners of the Treasury, or the Chancellor of the Exchequer shiould be satisfied that the trees growing on the said 11,000 acres were become past danger of the browsing of deer, cattle, or other prejudice, and shoulld think fit to lay open the same, or any part thereof, consisting of five hundred acres or more; and that in such case it should be lawful for his Majesty, in lieu of so much of the said eleven thousand acres as should be laid open, to inclose the like quantity out of any other part of the forest wastes. A clause in the same Act makes void any estate or interest in the forest lands which might be thereafter obtained by any person from the Crown. Another clause gives to the owners and occupiers of forest lands as a compensation in lieu of the right of common and of herbage, taken from them by the before mentioned enclosures, the privilege of cutting down and selling for their own use any timber growing upon their several lands; and also the privilege of improving, enclosing, fencing, and building on the said lands—of keeping dogs—and of hunting and killing beasts of chase and other game. The 11th section saves the liberties and privileges of all persons in and through the said forest at such times as the same should not be enclosed, and provides how the right of pannage and of common pasture should thereafter be enjoyed. An Act of the 48th Gen. III., c. 72, confirms the before-mentioned statute of Charles II. in all its essential particulars, and directs how persons, wilfully destroying any of the fences or enclosures, shall be punished. The third offence is made felony, and subjected to seven years' transportation, fine, or imprisonmnent, at the discretion of the Judge before whom the offenders may be tried.

TO DO

In pursuance of the foregoing Acts of Parliament, we understand . that 11,000 acres have been regularly inclosed. Some evil genius lately suggested to the foresters that the inclosures were not legal, d id that they would be justified in destroying them. The credulous foresters gave ear to the tempter, and immediately proceeded S to act on his suggestion. On the night of Saturday, the 21st of M May, part of the fence of an enclosure, called Oaken Hill, was thrown down, and the gates of that and other iuclosures entirely demolished. A reward of fifty guineas having been offered by Mr. Maclien for the discovery of the offenders, aii old f' collier, named James, went, we are told, to that geritltiiiaii soil 9 clahnied the reward, by declaring that he and his three sons had done the mischief. Similar nightly acts of destruction were continued until Wednesday morning last, when several hundreds of the foresters assembled at an early hour, with the avowed purpose of levelling all the fences throughout the forest. Te Magistrates, hearing of their intentions, went out to meet them before they had commenced their illegal proceedings, and having in vain endeavoured to dissuade them from their purpose, read the Riot Act. There being no military on the spot, the foresters . iiugied at the proceeding, and began the work of ruin, in which it ??? they laboured with as much zeal and ardour as if their lives depended upon its speedy execution. This levelling system was continued during the whole of Wednesday, and until Thursday night, by which time several miles of the inclosures were prostrated. On Wednesday one of the Magistrates went to Merthyr for some soldiers. He returned by the mail on Thursday with Major Mack- if worth, but nolle of the military could, it seens, be spared from Merthyr. Between six arnd seven o'clock yesterday morning, the Staff of the Militia and a reeruiing party of Marines, stationed in Monmouth, together with the pensioners residing in the town. and e neighbourhood (the whole group not exceeding 34 in number) Ce incaredl well-armned for the scene of action, Expectation Is on 3, the tip-toe to learn the result of their expedition, but no tidings have arrived. The foresters as yet have confined themselves to the destructioni of the fences, their language up to this time being—"Do not mrlest us in our object, and we will not molest you. ir Bring the soldiers against us and we will repel force with force—spill our blood, and yours shall be spilt." We do not hesitate to declare that the man who has taken so much pains to delude these simple and naturally unoffendinig creatures is no be'tel than a iLemon-one of those Afrites we read of in Eastern story, whose delight consists in scourging and afflicting the human race. We invite the poor deluded men to come to us for advice. If any of their just rights are withheld, we pledge ourselves to leave no stone unturned to obtain fli thern what they are entitled to. The benefit of our legal experience, and of our in abilities, Such as they are, shall be gratuitously at their service. Let them not listen to the seductive promises of wretches whose sole object it is to make ?? tools of them for their own purposes, arid id who, to gpail what they seek, would be the first to conisign their victims to the dungeon and the scaffold. FRIDAY, 'T'E- o'CLocK.-We have just had a long conversation with a gentleman frnom the forest, who has instructed us in some ?? particulars that may not be uninterestirig to our readers, The it soldiers who left Monmouth this morning, had estahilishied a soit Irs of garrison in the market-house of Coleford. They had not attempted to take any hostile proceedings against the levellers, but 1O warrants had been issued for the apprehension of the ringleaders, and it was expected they would surrender without opposition. The man named Warren James, to whom we have before alluded, is the chief instigator and director of the proceedings. The story igoes, that through some Noblemais in London, he has discovered an old charter or Act of Parliament, giving certain rights to the foresters, of wvhich they can never be deprived. One of the foresters told our informant on Tuesday that it was a document of ?? undoubted authenticity, having been signed by seven English Kigs, - amongst whom was his late Majesty George the Fourth, who af- zo fixed his signature to it just before he died.' The same man ac- ail qouaiited our informant of what was intended to be done on the Wednesday morning, when the work of destruction commenced .d and the whole came to pass exactly as tile hlid predicted Jamies arid or a large party et his companionls assembled at Whiteinead Park, declaring their intention to level the fences. Mr. Machen and several other gentlemen went out to remonstrate with them, explaining the Acts or Parliament under which the enclosures had taken place and ~s reqouilu rg to kinoiv by what Act or Acts of Parliament they plroferssed me to make out their claim. James said he would go and fetch the Acts (in which the rights of lhisself aid comradqs were founded. He accordingly disappeared for a few minutes, and returning withl ly a face of the most lumperturbable gravity, produced, as the voucher of his privilegeg??, ?? all enoi-mous pick-axe. Finding that they could do nothing with the mob, and not having sufficient force, civil or miolitary, to restrain their proceedings, the Magistrates went away; on which James sent for a constable, illid inl his presence stiperin-p tended the work of destruction, observing that he had sent for him to keep the peace. James is one of those men who, by somne means or other, has got at smattering of legal terms & phrases, from the ge- jieral itse of which, and of at great degree of natural shrewdness, he hais obtained the lieciki~Arnieof "I'ihe Counsellor.'' His fate will most assuredly prove `'a little knowledge is a dangerous thing.`' It will be ??etn by our formrol statement, that the inclosure of the forest wits dlirected ftr national lsurpoqeq.

The death of the late King, and the consequent dissolution of the Parliament, atiti breaking up of the Wellington Administration, prevented any further proceeding. It is said that since that time, the foresters have memorializted the present Commissioners of Woods and Forests on the subject, but without success. At the time they were in negociation with the late Ministry, a large subscription was alade atonog them, for the purpose of obtaining an Act for the opening of the enclosures; and it is certain that this fund has been subscribed to by all the poorer classes in the neigibourhood of the Forest. Under the persuasion that they have been unfairly dealt with, and itlstigated by persons who tell them that they have both the Crown and the law on their side, they have take ts le weork of redress (if their real or supposed grievances into their own hands.

There is another singular feature in this business worthy attention: the different parties were accompanied by carts conmeilting troie n,.ai hogsheads of cyder were distributed to the Mliltieptrogres3s of the woik. The only instance of outrage beyond the PritmlamY object of the foresters is the pulling down the garden walls of Mr. Gould, accompanied with a promise of serving hi IlSIoilse ill the same mainler, and occasional threats of personal violence to any persons who they judge are Put as spies to their conduct. Whether these distutrbances are to end here, time only will develope; some of the more violent are for proceeding to other acts of violence; the railways which intersect the forest in every direction, and the turnpike gates, are rumoured to be the next objects of attack, but the leaders appear to consider that the work for which they assembled was fi~llisileo- last night. The only shadow of a question of right appears to be, that the act provides that only eleven thousand acres, together wills a small quantity of about five or six hundred acres previously enclosed,' Shall be kept as a nursery for timber; now the foresters declare that considetably more have been enclosed. fTheit' assertion that the timber is of sufficient stature not to require protection is untrue; the most experienced woodwards, totally unconnected with the Crown lands, agree that the embankments should be kept up from seven to ten years yet to come. Be this as it may, the uninterrupted progress of the foresters during the last week cannot but have an injurious effect on the ??had spirits on thle Monmouthshire and Welch hills, ann the eveilts of the coming week are looked forward to with considerable anxiety. Sisice \vrithmlg the above, the militia staff, &C. have just received ordlers to be. in readiness to-morrow mortling, atfsve o'clock-their number will be increased by several volunteers. 5 ~~~TO THE EDItTOR OF THE GLOBE. Sir—As no doubt you have seen The Monmouth?? Ales'in, with an account of the Proceedings in the forest of Dean, I hasten to inform you (as tilattus are liljurious at this period in particular), that the mititasry who left this place on Friday morning returned yesterday afternoon, leaving the forest-the object of the foresters being ac. fcotnllishile-lluite peaceable. It appears they had not the least disposition of hostility towards any ?? else, their object being merely a destruction of the fences, vet the Irces, which inls o ra part of the forest, supposing they have a right of commonage thereto. I am, Sir, your's, Monmouth, June I2.

Monmouthshire Merlin - Saturday 18 June 1831

[ Also appears in large part in e.g. https://britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000183/18310620/027/0004 London Evening Standard - Monday 20 June 1831 ]

[Preceded by a report from Merthyr Tydfil]

FOREST OF DEAN. ARRIVAL OF THE MILITARY—DISPERSION OF THE LEVELLERS AND APPREHENSION OF THE RINGLEADERS. Our account of the proceedings in the Forest of Dean last week was necessarily concluded at a very interesting crisis, like an act in some dramatic entertainment, where the curtain drops upon a scene of great excitement, leaving the imagination upon the fret, until the time arrives for its further development. We must confess that we were not prepared for so favourable an issue as we have now to record. Up to Saturday evening the Foresters continued their work of devastation, and spoke in the most resolute manner of their determination to proceed in the task they had imposed upon themselves, and if any obstruction were offered, to repel force by force. These threats, happily for themselves, were not carried into execution. The arrival in Coleford, on Sunday, of a squadron of the 3d Dragoons, with their loaded pistols and carabines—their naked swords glittering in the sun—their limbs of Herculean mould—and their dashing military appearance, struck terror into the hearts of the bravest. These troops were reinforced on Monday morning by a large detachment of the 11th regiment of foot. On Sunday evening the Duke of Beaufort and the Marquis of Worcester arrived at Troy, and on the following morning proceeded to Coleford, where they were met by Sir Thomas Crawley Boevey, the High Sheriff of Gloucestershire, and a large party of Magistrates. At 11 o'clock a detachment of Dragoons, 50 of the Infantry, under the command of Major Mackworth, a large body of keepers, two of the London police establishment, accompanied by a body of Magistrates and Gentlemen, amongst the foremost of whom was the Marquis of Worcester, moved off for the Forest, and scoured the country in the direction of Parkend and Bream. In this entire district, which presented such a busy scene last week, scarcely a human being was to be seen. This force returned to Coleford at five o'clock, having captured seven prisoners, who were identified as having been employed in tearing down the fences. About this time an alarm reached the Magistrates that the Foresters had assembled in considerable force on the Ruardean-hill, and were engaged in destroying the remaining embankments. A troop of Dragoons was immediately dispatched to that quarter, but their very appearance in the distance frightened the levellers, and before the Dragoons reached the work of destruction not a man was to be seen; as the night was now drawing on, the troop returned to Coleford with one prisoner, having previously sent in two others.

The greatest exertions were of course made to apprehend James, the instigator and fomenter of the whole proceedings.— His house was searched on Monday, but the bird had flown; and his wife stated that he had not been home since the preceding Friday. On Wednesday morning a report came to Coleford that he had concealed himself in a place called *Hang*-pit—a very ominous name for one who had been guilty of felony without benefit of clergy. The constable who had the warrant for his apprehension, proceeded to the spot with a party of the military, and gave a signal usual among the colliers, to which James replied; and believing himself to be in friendly hands, suffered the party to draw him up from the pit, when he was immediately taken into custody. On his examination before the magistrates he was very dogged and sullen, and no information could be elicited from him. He was therefore committed to Gloucester Gaol to take his trial at the next assizes. A man named Birt, who, with two or three of his sons, had been very active in demolishing the inclosures, was also committed at the same time. The rest of the prisoners taken on Monday were admitted to bail. To shew that James wilfully misled the poor Foresters, who acted according to his suggestions, we need only state, that in his house was found an opinion of Sir Edward Sugden, at direct variance with what he had been promulgating amongst his simple countrymen as the law of the land. About 100 miles of the fences have been either destroyed or damaged, and the estimated expense of repairing them is £5000. The work of restoration has already commenced. One hundred men have been constantly employed for that purpose since Wednesday, and each of the keepers is allowed two persons to assist him in clearing the inclosures.

On Thursday, a man named Harris, alias Welshman, alias Poise-foot, another leveller of notoriety, was apprehended by Watkins the constable, and two of the forest keepers. When discovered and summoned to surrender, he brandished a large knife, and swore that he would be the death of any man who might venture to approach him. The constable and keepers immediately rushed upon and disarmed him. While they were conducting him before the magistrates he contrived, without being perceived, to draw from his pocket a pistol, which he placed close to the ear of the constable and snapped. The pistol fortunately missed fire, otherwise Watkins must have been a dead man; for, on being taken from him it was found loaded up to the muzzle. For this attempt at assassination the ruffian has been committed to take his trial at the next Gloucester assizes.

A general impression has gone forth, that Mr. Machen, with a previous knowledge of the intentions of the Foresters to destroy the inclosures, took no steps to prevent them from accomplishing their object; that in the first instance there were but 40 or 50 levellers employed; and that with a few constables he might have stifled the mischief in its birth. This is altogether a false notion. We are informed by a gentleman who was present on the morning when the demolition commenced, that Mr. Machen had provided himself with 50 men, upon whose zeal and fidelity he could rely, and who were anxious to attempt the dispersion of the levellers, but the numbers of the latter were so much superior that Mr. Machen would not allow them to interfere. The gentleman in question confidently assures us, that in the very outset of the business there were at least 80 men at work—that from 100 to 120 more stood looking on—and that the tops of the neighbouring hills were crowded with people, who were hastening to the scene of action. Any attempt to disperse the rioters under such circumstances would have been an act of great imprudence, to say the least of it.

We shall take this opportunity also of correcting the very mean opinion that has been entertained of the small corps, consisting of the militia staff, the marine recruiting party, and the pensioners, which left Monmouth for Coleford yesterday se'nnight. —On leaving Monmouth, and on their arrival in Coleford, they were sneered at and ridiculed. So far, however, were they from deserving the contempt with which they were treated, that Major Mackworth, after putting them through their evolutions, undertook before the magistrates assembled at Coleford, with their assistance alone, to stop the proceedings of the levellers.— The answer of the magistrates deserves to be recorded in letters of gold. "We do not doubt your ability, but bloodshed will be the consequence. Our object is not to murder the peasantry, but to shew them such a force as will convince all but fools and idiots that resistance will be in vain." The conduct of these men during their stay in Coleford was so exemplary, that they left that town with the respect and gratitude of the inhabitants, and the following testimonial from the magistrates:—

"The Magistrates assembled at Coleford cannot allow Captain Mitchell and Captain Kane, with the men under their command, to return home without begging these officers to accept of their best thanks for the ready manner in which they complied with the wishes of the Magistrates to attend at Coleford in aid of the civil power, and for the active and attentive manner in which they have performed the duty imposed upon them; and they request the officers will be so good as to convey to the non-commissioned officers and men under their command, how highly the Magistrates approve of their conduct.

(Signed) Beaufort. Maynard Colchester.  
Worcester. Carles Crawley.  
George Rooke. Edward Machen.  
P. S. Ducarel.

We understand that a proposal was yesterday made to the magistrates, on the part of the levellers who were not assembled on Wednesday se'nnight when the riot act was read, and who did not make themselves conspicuous by pressing others into the illegal service, that they may be absolved from the penalties they have incurred on giving one week's work, in reparation of the mischief committed. By this offer the Foresters have shewn that they are sensible of their error; and on account of the delusion that has been practised upon them, we do hope the proposal will not be rejected. In mercy to their wives and poor helpless children, let the rules of justice be a little relaxed. Their conduct in general has been peaceable and orderly, and the punishment of the ringleaders, who have been already taken, will convince them for the future, that every violation of the laws must end in sorrow and repentance.

For our own parts we have not been indifferent to the interests of these poor people. We have employed the greater part of the past week in hunting for and perusing ancient documents on the subject of the rights and privileges they lay claim to. In our next we shall publish for their benefit the result of our researches.

Evans and Ruffy's Farmer's Journal - Monday 20 June 1831

FOREST OF DEAN. The Government inclosures of this Forest were thrown down about a fortnight since, by a large body of the foresters, who appear to have acted under the impression that the right of commonage reverted to them at the end of 21 years. On Sunday evening two troops of the 3rd Dragoon Guards arrived in Colford from Dorchester, who were joined on Monday morning by the militia staff, pensioners, &c., from this town, amounting to 70 men. The Duke of Beaufort, Lord Lieutenant of the county, the Marquis of Worcester, and several Magistrates, had also assembled; and many gentlemen resident in this town and its vicinity volunteered their services in aid of the authorities. At 11 o'clock a detachment of dragoons, 50 of the infantry, under the command of Major Mackworth, a large body of keepers, two of the London police establishment, accompanied by a body of Magistrates and gentlemen, moved off for the forest, and scowered the country in the direction of Parkend and Bream; in this entire district, which presented such a busy scene last week, scarcely a human being was to be seen. This force returned to Colford at five o'clock, having captured seven prisoners, who were identified as having been employed in tearing down the fences. About this time an alarm reached the Magistrates that the foresters had assembled in considerable force on the Ruardean-hill, and were engaged in destroying the remaining embankments. A troop of dragoons was immediately dispatched to this quarter, but their very appearance in the distance frightened the levellers, and before the dragoons reached the work of destruction, not a man was to be seen. As night was now drawing on, the troop returned to Colford with one prisoner, having previously sent in two others. The 10 prisoners taken, with the exception of two, are young lads scarcely arrived to manhood; after a brief examination before the Magistrates, they were confined in the room above the market house, and a strong guard placed over them.

The little town of Colford was literally filled with strangers, and there appeared the best feeling among these visiters to aid the Magistrates. A strong reaction in the minds of the foresters had already taken place: they are now painfully convinced they have been the dupes of a few bad men, and it is extremely probable, if these leaders have not escaped, the foresters themselves will be active in their apprehension. A sort of offer of compromise was made yesterday, to make a general surrender if bail would be accepted; but this was refused by the Magistrates.

That these leaders have used the names of persona of distinction, to give colour to their proceedings, is clearly ascertained; but it is to be hoped, for their honour, that it will be as clearly proved that they have been used without authority. From a most careful examination of the whole of this unfortunate affair, it would seem, by artifices so improbable as scarcely to be credible, that one man (Warren James,) has effected a combination so complete amidst the foresters, that 4,000 or 5,000 men could be collected by a war-whoop (for literally this was the signal for assemblieg), and had them, when assembled, so completely under control, that his *ipac dixat* for the commission of any act of violence would have been the foresters' warrant for its execution.

The amount of damage is variously estimated; the extent of fencing destroyed is supposed to exceed 60 miles, and its reparation to cost £15,000; and this daniage, leaving out of the question the effect of example in a neighbourhood abounding with newly enclosed lands, and the quantum of suffering which will be inflicted on the agents in this business, might have been prevented by foresight, in providing a small force to suppress the evil at its first development; and there was sufficient time for this, for three days' notice was fairly given, and that to persons officially connected with the forest, of the intention of the levellers.

The accounts from the Monmouthshirc hills are still favourable: the men are at their employ; there have been no assemblages to disturb the peace, and the imagination of the agitators is now almost exhausted in the invention of descriptive accounts of scenes which never existed but in the chimera of a vitiated brain.

Morning Herald (London) - Monday 15 August 1831

GLOUCESTER ASSIZES; (before Mr. Justice PATTESON.)

FOREST OF DEAN RIOTS.

*Warren James*, a man of extremely respectable appearance, was indicted for the capital offence of remaining with rioters for one hour after the reading of the proclamation contained in the Riot Act.

Mr. JERVIS, Mr. CAMPBELL, Mr. ALEXANDER, and Mr. TALBOT cohducted the prosecution; Mr. C. PHILLIPS and Mr. PHILLPOTTS the defence.

Mr. JERVIS stated that this was a capital offence, and that to make out the case three things must be proved-—first, that there was a riot; 2dly, that proclamationwas made; and 3dly, that the prisoner and others, to the number of 12 or more, remained together for an hour after such proclamation. It would appear that, by an Act of Parliament, passed is the year 1808, his Majesty was empowered to enclose 11,000 acres in the Forest of Dean, and that, when the Commissioners of the Treasury were of opinion that the timber in such enclosures was suffiiently strong net to be injured by cattle, they had the power of throwing down the enclosures, for the benefit of those who had the rights of common. In the month of May the prisoner, who was a free miner, had sent a letter on the behalf of the free miners to the Surveyor-General of the Forest, asking that the inclosures should be opened, and consequences insued as detailed by the following witnesses:—

Edward Machin, Esq. said, I am a Magistrate; I am Surveyor-general of the forest of Dean. In consequence of seeing a notice I published another notice or caution, which was generally distributed and circulated. I sent one to the prisoner. I received a letter purporting to come from the prisoner. I saw him on Sunday the 5th of June; I said to him "How can you think of misleading persons in the way you are doing, you will bring yourself and others into danger; what can you mean by it?" He replied—"We are all right, the forest was given up to us in Parliament last year." I replied, "This is so absurd that if you allow yourselves to be drawn on it will be your own fault." The prisoner said, "I have the Act of Parliament at home." On the Wednesday following I went to the prisoner's house; I saw him; he was accompanied by about 12 or 14 persons. I asked him how he could continue to mislead the people. I said to him, "You tell one person you have an Act, and another that you have a Charter—If you have any documents why do you not produce them?" He said, "I have a Charter, and will fetch it." He went to his house for a minute or two, and then returned with a pick-axe on his shoulder; he went towards the Park-hill enclosure, other persons following him. My brother, Mr. Henry Davis, followed them; they took up a position on rising ground; we met our special constables at the enclosure, and small parties joined those who were with the prisoner, and they huzzaed as each party joined. The prisoner and party increased to about 200, about 80 of them having spades, pick-axes, and mattocks, which they flourished about. I put myself between the mob and the enclosure, and forbad them touching the bank. I commanded them in the King's name to disperse. They paid no attention. There were eighty at work destroying the enclosures. Thinking I was net strong enough, with the woodman, to disperse or apprehend them, I took the last volume of "Burn," and read the Riot Act to them. Before I read it, I commanded silence with a loud voice, several times. The persons cried out, "Well done my lads." This was at about half-past seven o'clock in the morning. Mr. Ducarel, a Magistrate, arrived, and I requested him to read the Riot Act again, and he did so. I left them at about a quarter past eight pulling down the banks. The prisoner was still with them. I returned about ten, and the mob was then about 300 or 400. I saw the prisoner again in the course of the day, but I do not recollect the particular times. Much damage had been done, and a mile of fencing pulled down. I did not consider it safe to attempt to apprehend any of them, because our constablea were unarmed. I was not alarmed, and did not consider myself in any personal danger as long as they were allowed to pull down the fences. I considered the property in danger.

Cross-examined by Mr. C. PHILLIPS.—The prisoner has always been a peaceable, well conducted man. I received no personal violence of any kind. The special constables were about 40.

The notices stated were read.

Evidence was given that the prisoner continued with the mob nearly the whole of the day.

The prisoner. in his defence, said that he had left the rioters several times in the course of the day.

Mr. Justice PATTESON summed up the evidence.

Verdict—*Guilty*.

Mr. Justice PATTESON informed the prisoner that his life would be spared, but that he must not expect to escape with a very slight punishment, as outrages of this kind must be put a stop to.

There were other charges against the prisoner for rioting on the three following days, but on these Mr. JERVIS declined offering any evidence.

Resident Forrester — The Life of Warren James (transcript)

Resident Forester

By ian wright

October 19, 2021

The Life of Warren James is an account by a 'Resident Forester' of the 1831 uprising in the Forest of Dean led by Warren James. I have transcribed it in full at the end of this artcle.

It was printed only a few months after the events and has been used as a primary source for historians studying the events surrounding the riot. In my opinion, it was written by a member of the local gentry or the ruling elite and is full of tropes and some half-truths. I think the purpose of the text was to justify the action taken by the authorities against the Foresters who rebelled. The underlying narrative attempts to patronise and undermine the character and motives of rioters and their "reputed champion", Warren James. So, it must be read with caution.

Foresters are described as "bold", "daring", "wild and free" with "lion-like courage". Their "externals were rough and unpolished" with a "total ignorance of refined life".

The Resident Forester quotes Lord Gage who thinks that actual poverty was unknown in the Forest of Dean and argues that Foresters were "highly privileged with pious ministers" and "the poorest among them is better off than any town mechanic; and the richer are petty princes, living on their own lands, rent and tax free."

However, at the same time, the Resident Forester tells a story to illustrate how Foresters were 'patriotic and loyal servants who followed their masters with unquestioning deference'.

Those involved in the riot were regarded as "misguided", "misled", "mistaken", "deluded" in defending what "they imagine to be privileges" but actually "trampling on the laws of their country" and contrasted with those with "heads more enlightened than their own."

Warren James is characterised as good but as a naïve and simple "sentimentalist" easily influenced and misled by a "malign being" from London. He is contrasted with another rioter John Harris who was "a wretched man", "void of principle or feeling" and "the terror of the neighbourhood".

Chris Fisher  is also highly critical of the story as related by The Resident Forester and the Globe. In The Forest of Dean Miners' Riot of 1831 (Bristol: BRHG, 2020) He argues the following (in bold):

"At the time of the riot, there were rumours of plot and conspiracy. The correspondent of The Globe, who referred to the rioters as "the levellers" and to the riot as "this levelling system", seemed to believe that the miners were the victims of the "seductive promises of wretches whose sole object is to make tools of them for their own purposes". He went on:

There is some movement in this business which demands prompt and strict investigation. The writer of this conversed with two men who were pressed on Thursday and compelled to assist in throwing down the banks, and it is evident from their report, that the great majority of the foresters believe that Warren James, their openly avowed leader and who is the O'Connell of the Forest, is but the tool agent of some one or more noblemen in town who are determined to "see the foresters righted". It would not be prudent or just to use the names of the parties mentioned, for perhaps it is a licence taken by the leaders of the rioters without authority. A sister of James, it is said, lives with a nobleman, who the foresters expect will be in the forest shortly again, and James has been twice to town to have interviews on this business; one fact is evident, that the poor men are acting under the impression that they are committing no illegal act, and that no resistance will be offered them.[1]

Warren James' biographer (The Resident Forester) accepted one version of the plot story. Sometime before the riot, he wrote, James' sister went to live in London and "from the acquaintance there formed, was led to believe the Foresters were a people denied their privileges and deprived of their birthrights". This she passed on to her brother who:

had long, though secretly, brooded over the desire of delivering himself and countrymen from what he felt and was persuaded was a thraldom … his London friend, falsely so called, encouraged this desire; and Warren was firmly persuaded that he should find friends among the higher powers. Whatever form or name is possessed by the malign being who thus urged him on, it is a subject of regret that he cannot be held up to public odium so fully as he deserves.[2]

The first of these reports, however, was avowedly a rumour, and one couched in the vaguest terms. The Gloucester Journal's correspondent put the same rumour in a different light:

The most ridiculous reports are as usual current respecting the instigation of these riots. It is said that they are persons of wealth and rank and parliamentary influence, but such nonsense is scarcely worth repeating. The only known leader is the Warren James, whose name was affixed to the handbill inviting the Foresters to meet to lay open the Forest. [3]

The magistrates in their report to the Home Office equally disbelieved in a plot. Warren James, they reported, had gained great influence among the miners by:

stating that he was countenanced by persons high in authority and by the Government itself … but we have no idea that (the miners) were assisted by any person of higher rank, or that the riots have connection with any political cause.[4]

There is nothing in the surviving Home Office or Treasury Solicitor's papers to suggest that the Government took seriously any suggestion that political agitation lay behind the riot. The Solicitor's lenient treatment of the rioters who were taken into custody, apart from James of course, suggests the contrary.

James' biographer was probably caught in an artistic trap of his own making. The purpose of the biography was to "consider the motives by which those misguided men (the rioters) were influenced".[5] His method was to draw a character sketch of the 'forester' which would make clear that, whatever else may have been true, the miners were not seditious men. Though rioters in other parts of the Kingdom, he argued, were looked upon with horror and detestation, the Dean miners were a special case:

Whilst we view them with a disproving eye, as trampling on the laws of their country, the tear of commiseration will steal down the cheek of humanity, when pondering o'er the woes of a race of men so firm, so devoted — in a mistaken cause!

He went on:

The Foresters were ever a distinct body of people; they lived on their own lands, were governed by their own laws, and stood firm for what they imagined their exclusive privileges. Bold, daring and truly hospitable … with spirits wild and free as their native woods, hearts open and generous as their externals were rough and unpolished, they were at once the dread and veneration of their neighbours.[6]

Even the roughness of the forester was not as pronounced as it once had been. "In later years the spirit of the gospel which had been preached with evangelical purity" had exercised a benign influence on the miners, just as it had on the Esquimaux.[7] To this list of Virtues, he added, at the top, the ancient and selfless loyalty of the miners to their Kings. There was, however, a fatal flaw in the forester's character in that he had "a total ignorance of refined life":

It is related of one of them that being at an inn, and calling for a pint and a pipe, the servant brought them and also placed by his side a spittoon. John fidgeted for some time in his chair, and then gently removing it with his foot, expectorated on the floor. The girl, who prided herself on her housewifery, again placed the metal dish at his feet; John now lost all patience, he could command his temper no longer. "I tell thee what, wench", said he, "if thee doesn't move this cullender away, curse me but I'll spit in him".[8]

Thus the 'forester' was wild, brave, loyal and Christian, but not a little naive. And thus, the riot was not a terrible deed, but the pitiful act of a "misled, mistaken people".[9] All this, true of the foresters in general, was true of Warren James in particular. He was a man of considerable virtue:

From his youth, he was of a mild, reserved, and peaceable turn of mind, if anything, rather inclined to melancholy; he was what would, in refined society, have been denominated a sentimentalist. He was of the most abstemious habits and was often known to eat, after returning from church, on a Sunday morning, a dinner formed solely of vegetables, and repair thither again to attend the afternoon service. He disdained any show in apparel.[10]

As might be expected, he was his widowed mother's favourite son and lived in her house until he was taken away by the soldiers. Even his part in the riot was indicative of virtue. He acted:

not with the wild impulse of riot, but the calm determination of a man willing to resign private benefit for public good, as he has been frequently heard to say he would willingly give up his own life, if by that means he could gain his countrymen their liberties. He felt it a duty – he viewed it as an honour.[11]

How was it that this virtuous, selfless man could be the source of the delusion which misled the miners into riot? He could not have been seditious and disloyal because he was, after all, a forester. The insertion into the story of the shadowy, malign being in London avoids the contradiction leading to the conclusion that James was himself mistaken and misled. This is not to say that James had not taken advice in London. He had, in fact, consulted a solicitor there about the miners' rights and privileges. This matter will be discussed below in its proper context.[12] The point for the moment is that there is no reason to believe that there was any substance in the rumours of plot and conspiracy conducted by mysterious great men in London and certainly no reason to think the riot was the product of distant political manipulation."

The Resident Forester finally adds that events would have turned out differently if only the Foresters had acknowledged that "the advice given them by Mr. Machen was in the spirit of truth and friendship, but 'twas only believed when it could not benefit them".

So who was the  Resident Forester?  Could he have been Philip Ducural, the man who issued a warrant for the arrest of Warren James? He was a well-known poet and author and therefore skilled at creating a narrative and telling stories.

As the disturbances in the Forest of Dean are become the object of intense interest, both from the novelty of their nature, and the strict line of justice that has been adhered to, in regard to those implicated in the transaction, it may not…perhaps be amiss to consider the motives by which those misguided men were influenced.

Others, who, in various parts of the kingdom have been denominated Rioters, are looked on with detestation and horror—but far different are the sentiments evinced for the Foresters.

Whilst we view them with a disproving eye as trampling on the laws of their country, the tear of commiseration will shed down the cheek of humanity, when pondering o'er the woes of a race of men so firm, so unbending, so devoted—in a taken cause!

The Foresters were ever a distinct body of people; they lived on their own were governed by their own laws and stood firm for what they imagine to be privileges. Bold, daring and truly hospitable, was ever the character of these men; whilst there was everything to apprehend from their sudden resentments there was nothing to fear from cherished sense or recollection of a wrong.

With spirits wild and free as their own woods, hearts open and generous, their externals were rough and unpolished. They were at once the dread and veneration of their neighbours; so that the cousins of Hereford and Monmouth would at any time prefer the right hand of fellowship to that of trying their prowess, even in what they term a friendly row. Their muscular strength exceeds that of perhaps any living race of men; and it is not surprising to those acquainted with them, to see a native of the Forest, under the middle size throw with apparent ease, a man twice his weight and almost twice his size, who encounters him in his wrestling matches, of which noble exercise they are most passionately fond. As soldiers or sailors, they were never obscure characters—their lion-like courage shone forth conspicuous—no idea of bodily suffering deterred them, which the following anecdote will illustrate more clearly; it was related to me by the brother of a general officer, who shed his blood on the plains of Waterloo: —

A native of the Forest had engaged in the general's service, during the short interval of peace, in 1814. At the renewing of hostilities with France, general………  was ordered again into actual service.  George begged permission of his master to enlist; this was refused. "You shall go with me George," he said, "but I want you near my person, which if you enter into service will be impossible." "Ah sir," said George, "that is all I want—to be near you, it mayhap you go to battle." George accompanied his master; but during several skirmishes in which the English troops engaged, George abandoned the host assigned him (as baggage, guard), at the risk of his own life, to view from an eminence his master's party; but when the last decisive day arrived, and "all who nobly stood or bravely fell" were met, George threw himself on his knees, and in terms rendered eloquent from the energetic force with which they were spoken, besought permission to fight by the side of his brave master. The general could no longer withstand so noble a request; he honored him by uniting him with a party whose valour rendered them so conspicuous on that occasion. When near the close of the day, he found his master faint from wounds and fatigue, George brought him a small bottle of wine and a biscuit. "George," said the general, "have you anything to eat yourself?"—"Pray eat on, my dear master," was his answer; "never mind me, I am but one, and a poor one too, hardly of any use; if I go, another can fill my place, but you, my master, thousands live and act in you; if you fall"—here his voice faultered, and the tears never shed for himself chased each other down his manly cheeks, at the thought, "if you fall, what should I live for?"

The master was worthy of his servant— he insisted on sharing his bread and wine with his faithful friend. He left his master, and shortly afterwards both were severely wounded. Turning to a comrade, who had pledged himself to remove him from the scene of action, and who approached to raise him from the ground— "Hot work this, Jem," said the fallen hero, "but never mind, 'tis for the honour of old England; but where is the general, tell me? Look out, and see where he is—ah! He is off his horse; fly! never mind me—see what you can do for him." "But stay," said his comrade, "the enemy will be here."—"Go," replied George, "I will not be moved, no, not an inch, till I see my master is no worse off than myself."

The soldier found the general had been carried off deeply, and indeed mortally wounded: he returned and related to George what he had learnt. "Thank God then," said he, "we shall die together, for I feel I've not long to live; make what haste you can, that I may see him—I think if I could see him but once more, I could give three cheers for old England."

We regret to say he did not see his valued master again, for upon moving him from the ground, the wounds opened afresh, and in a few moments this brave fellow breathed his last, nor did the noble general survive him but two hours.

Their total ignorance of refined life was, a few years ago, a subject of merriment to their more polished neighbours. It is related of one of them well known in the precincts of the Forest, that being at an inn, and calling for a pint and pipe, the servant brought them, and also placed by his side a spittoon. John fidgetted for some time in his chair, and then gently removing it with his foot, expectorated on the floor. The girl, who prided herself on her house-wifery, again placed the metal dish at his feet; John now lost all patience, he could command his temper no longer. "I tell thee what, wench," said he, "if thee doesn't move this cullender away, curse me but I'll spit in him."

Such are the outlines of the characters that are coming under our consideration. In later years, however, the spirit of the Gospel, which has been preached with evangelical purity, has caused a prominent change in the customs and manners of this interesting race of people. It has here, as in every place where its power is felt (from the cheerless abode of the benighted Esquimaux, to the torrid zone of western Africa), diffused its benign influence; and those men (who a few years ago, when ember died, inspired the surrounding country with terror), were viewed in the late disturbances only as a misled, mistaken, people—but without (except by those individuals whose office called upon them to oppose their proceedings), the least idea of personal danger. It must ever form a subject of regret to a benevolent heart, to reflect, that it could afford gratification to heads more enlightened than their own, to lead into error and ultimate exile, a set of men who, they must have been aware, depended on their judgment for direction, in regaining what they imagined their birthright.

Proud of their birth—stern in their idea of right and wrong – 'tis not to be wondered, that whilst they considered themselves torn from those privileges, they should stand up to a man to defend their disputed cause.

The Forest of Dean lies in the western part of the county, is of a triangular form, included between the Wye, the Severn, and the small river Leydon. It contains 30,000 acres, is twenty miles long and ten broad, and was anciently overrun with woods. The oaks that grow where the wood is still preserved, are reckoned the best in England, and from this Forest most of the timber formerly employed in ship building was brought, which was so, well known to the Spaniards, that whet they fitted out their armada in 1558, to invade England, those who had the direction of that expedition were expressly ordered to destroy this Forest, as the most effectual way to ruin our marine.

But since the discovery of many mines of iron, and the passing of several acts of parliament for erecting forges for the working of them, these woods became gradually reduced, and several towns and villages have been built in the Forest, where the manufacture of iron is carried on.

However, in the reign of Charles II, an act was passed empowering certain persons to enclose great numbers of trees, for the preservation of the timber; and some years ago, many cottages which had been built in and near the woods, were ordered to be pulled down, because the inhabitants damaged the trees by lopping them for fuel. As forests are the property of the crown, the king has a large and strong building in the midst of this Forest, where there is a swanimote court, to preserve the vert and venison—it is called the Speech House; the judges of it are verderers, chosen by. the freeholders of the county. The miners have also a court in this Forest, held at the castle of St. Briavels, where they have laws of their own, proper for the carrying on of their affairs and deciding their differences, in which there used to be a peculiar custom of an evidence's swearing by touching a Bible with a kind of consecrated stick, and not with his supposed defiled, because dirty, hand. In it is a prison for offenders. The government of this castle has always been given to some of the nobility. Many of these ancient forms are now fallen to decay.

It was a mistaken idea relating to the act of 48 Geo. III. c. 72 (by which authority the Forest was enclosed, the provisions of which were the same as those of 20 C. 11. c. 3, by which it was enacted that eleven thousand acres of the Forest should be always set apart for the preservation of timber; and that the lords of the treasury might, when they saw that the timber was out of danger, and properly preserved from being injured by cattle, throw open to the public), that induced the people to take the steps they did.

As a great deal of the timber was considered by them to be already sufficiently strong, they supposed it their privilege to have the benefit of such land for the use of their cattle. The surveyor general of the Forest, E. Machen, Esq., was of a different opinion; he saw the fences could not be thrown down and the cattle admitted, without exposing the young trees to considerable damage. Now that either party were right, it is not for an individual to decide—the committee formed for that purpose will, in the limited time, no doubt determine; till then the point will be contested. It is much to be regretted this investigation had not been entered into before so many families were brought to misery and want, by being deprived of the services of those who were their support had this, I say, been done, none but madmen would, in open violation of a known law, have proceeded to the lengths that Warren James, and his infatuated companions were induced to do.

Warren James was born in the Forest of Dean, in the year 1794. From his youth he was of a mild, reserved, and peaceable turn of mind, if anything, rather inclined to melancholy; he was what would, in refined society, have been denominated a sentimentalist. He was of the most abstemious habits, and was often known to eat, after returning from church, on a Sunday, morning a dinner formed solely of vegetables and repair thither again to attend the afternoon service. He disdained any show in apparel; and this has on some occasions exposed him to not a little inconvenience. It is related of him that on attending a neighbouring fair, for the purpose of disposing of a horse, his appearance was such as to excite suspicion as to how the animal came into his possession, and he was in consequence held in custody, until satisfactory evidence could be produced on his behalf.

He was his mother's favourite son; she had been for some years a widow, and Warren resided under the same roof with her, to the day of his heading the party in the demolition of the Forest boundaries.

Sometime previous to the period mentioned, a sister of his went to reside in London, and from the acquaintance there formed, was led to believe the Foresters were a people denied their privileges and deprived of their birthrights; this was imparted to her brother, who at once felt it incumbent on him to take a prominent part in endeavouring to redress their wrongs, as to his judgment they always appealed in any point of difference or dispute, for he was not a man to act without much deliberation; uninfluenced by passion, when once he had determined, no power or argument could shake him from his purpose.

He, on the first intimation of these rights (as they were called), convened a meeting at the Speech House, from which a deputation, consisting of such men, as were thought most fit for the office, was chosen to wait upon lord Lowther; money was collected for their expenses, and they set out on their important embassy. What the nature of the interview was, it is not for me to say, but they returned with the fullest confidence of restitution.

It appears that Warren James had long, though secretly, brooded over the desired delivering himself and countrymen, from what he felt and was persuaded was a thraldom; but this was not with the wild impulse of riot, but the calm determination of a man willing to resign private benefit for public good, as he has been frequently heard to say he would willingly give up his own life, if by that means he could gain his countrymen their liberties. He felt it a duty—he viewed it as an honour; and the information having first come from his sister, his companions looked up to him as their grand spring of action—as the champion of their long-lost liberties.

Thus, called upon, he could not (without acknowledging doubts which do not appear to have existed), recede from the point to which he had brought so many: his London friend, falsely so called, encouraged this desire; and Warren was firmly persuaded that he should find friends. among the higher powers.

Whatever form or name is possessed by the malign being who thus urged him on, it is a subject of regret that he cannot be held up to public odium so fully as he deserves.

Early in the spring, a person who resided near to Warren, (or, as he is generally called Warry,) had occasion to speak to him respecting the trespass of his cattle. "Oh," said he, "never mind, in two months all will be free—the inclosures will be thrown open, and we shall have plenty of free land; the twenty years are now expired that they were to be closed." This neighbour expressed his doubts as to the legality of such, undertaking—"Come with us," said he, "You have nothing to fear; the King and Lord Lowther is on our side."

About a fortnight previous to the eighth of June, on which day they believed the term of years to expire, Warren engaged a printer, named Stinson, residing in the town of Coleford, to print him fifty copies of a notice, announcing a meeting of the Free Miners of the Forest of Dean, on Wednesday, the eighth day of June, for the purpose of opening the Forest, and asserting their right of common, of which they had, as they said, been so long deprived. Those papers were signed, "Warren James." They were posted up in the most conspicuous places; and that they might be more extensively circulated, a number were given to the attendants on a funeral from Whitecroft, which took place about that time.

In consequence of this, E. Machen, Esq. issued a cautionary notice, warning all persons who had any value for their liberty, against joining them in their work of destruction; and advising those who were quietly disposed, against letting curiosity: take them to the spot, as in that case, the innocent would be likely to suffer with the guilty.

On Sunday, the fifth of June, Mr. Machen sent for Warren – "How can you think," said he; "of misleading the people in this way? What are you doing? You will bring yourself and them into trouble." "Oh," he replied, "we are all right: the Forest was given up to us in parliament last year." A number of persons were assembled round them, to listen to what was passing; Mr. Machen turned round to them. "This is absurd," said he; "if you know yourselves to be drawn on by a man who can say nothing more to the purpose than this, it will be your own fault." Mr. Machen remonstrated with him some time, begged him not to mislead the innocent, and told him if he wished to be informed as to the laws relating to the inclosure, to come to him, bring anyone he chose with him, and he would read to them the Acts of Parliament. "Oh," said Warren, "I have an act of parliament: l am determined to go on." Mr. Machen asked him, why he did not bring it down, and show it him; he replied, he would. Mr. Machen then left him, as he could not dissuade him from proceeding in the way he had marked out.  He was then asked by the assistant surveyor when and where he intended to begin. He replied, "on Wednesday morning, at Whitecroft, just below Park Hill enclosure."

The lenient manner in which these communications were received, inspired the more timid with fresh courage: their champion had openly declared his intentions, and still all was quiet—no effective measures were set on foot to prevent them from putting their designs into execution. "Surely then," said they, "we must be right; they would prevent us if they could, but this they do not attempt." New life seemed to animate them—fresh vigour to impel them to action; and they waited with impatience the day that was to restore to themselves and their posterity, their long-lost liberties. A few days, and they would emerge from what they now looked on as slavery—expel usurpers, and supply their posts out of their friends and brothers. The time that intervened was that of deep discussion; 'twas a point no one could determine—everyone was interested in—and all wished, yet almost trembled at, what might be the result.

The more calm part of their neighbours were of opinion, that their mode of proceeding was what would lay them open to the greatest danger. All wished if they had been deprived of their liberties, that they might be restored them; yet this was a way likely to involve them in the utmost perplexity, whether they succeeded in their endeavours or not.

At length the memorable day arrived. Mr. Machen went over to the residence of Warren James, between six and seven o'clock in the morning. Warren was not in the house, but on Mr. Machen sending for him he came, accompanied by twelve or fourteen persons. Alter remonstrating with him for some time on what he had in agitation, he said, "You tell one person you have an act of parliament, and another that you have a charter; if you have any document, why don't you produce it?" He replied, "I have a charter." Mr. Machen then inquired where it was. He answered, "In that house," pointing to his own house; "and I will get it." He entered the house, but appeared in a few minutes, bearing on his shoulder a pickaxe; which, as he produced nothing else, we supposed to have been the charter to which he alluded: He directly turned off, followed by several persons who were assembled; they proceeded until they came within a hundred yards of Park Hill enclosure, where they took their station. Parties of about ten or twelve each, were seen pouring in from all quarters; they were hailed on their approach with loud cheers, and much shouting, by those already assembled.

Their number soon increased to nearly two hundred: about eighty of these were provided with either spades or pickaxes. H. Davies, Esq., banker, of Monmouth, who was on the spot at the time, went up to the party, and asked them what they wanted. One of them directly came forward, and gave him a paper on which was written—" King William and Reform! Our Rights, and nothing but our Rights! " "And that," said he, " is what we want." Some complained that foreigners came to the Forest without coats, and presently were seen riding about in their gigs. One of the men said, that they would tear up the railroads, and drive all the foreigners out of the Forest.

Mr. Davies asked them what could induce them to attack the enclosures, as his brother did not employ foreigners. They however continued by the enclosure gate, where the special constables were stationed, flourishing their pick-axes round their heads, and striking them violently into the ground. They then rushed in a body towards the enclosure. Mr. Machen advanced, and forbid them touching the bank. Warren now made a rush, and struck into it with his pick-axe. One of the mob called out, "There's the first blow": they then fell to work, some with tools, others with their hands.

Mr. Machen read the riot act, and, as they still persisted in tearing down the fences, it was again read by another magistrate, in about the space of twenty minutes; but all attempts on the part of the magistrates were alike ineffectual: they continued their work, and by ten o'clock they were four hundred strong. The assistant surveyor, going up to Warren, told him he was afraid it would go badly with him: he replied, he did not fear, that he had the law in his own hands, and said, "I would advise you not to meddle with me or my party, we are too many for you." The special constables were all unarmed, and any further interference, when their numbers were so unequal, was deemed highly dangerous. Before the day closed, they were joined by about eighty women, who seemed still more intent on the work of destruction than the men.

Their mode of proceeding was this; they took few yards at a time, which a large body rushed on, and by mere muscular strength overthrew. This appears still more worthy of note, from the thickness of the walls, which were mostly composed of clayey earth, in some places seven or eight feet thick. Gorse of many years growth had strengthened these boundaries, by shooting down roots into the earth of a prodigious size, and interlacing its branches in such a manner on the top, that it appeared to a spectator to require a work of time to effect its overthrow, and not that of two or three days. They first cut away some of the strongest of the roots, and then proceeded in the way mentioned, tearing down all before them, and at the fall of each fresh piece giving loud and repeated cheers.

The second day they were joined by thrice the number, as the proceedings of the former one had inspired them with fresh courage; and so far did this influence prevail, that several gentlemen in the county supplied them with hogsheads of cider, and every necessary provision, which Warry was busily employed in conveying to the spot. It was them deemed necessary to call in military aid, and a party from Monmouth, consisting mostly of pensioners and recruits, were marched in, to put a stop to their invasions.

But this plan defeated its own purpose, as their (by no means imposing) array was calculated to inspire anything but terror; and their reception in the town of Coleford proved that they carried good humour with them wherever they went. The Foresters having had intimation of their approach, hastened down to welcome them, and whilst they waited in the yard of the head inn, the "Angel," for orders, greeted them from without by the appellation of the "ragged regiment," and invited them up to the Forest, to see them at work.

We shall not attempt to fathom the motives which made those men prefer remaining in a large room over the market-house, together, to that of being billeted at the different inns in the town. Be it as it may, this was their choice; they all spent the night here, having a guard constantly on duty at the door. The Foresters were well aware of this timidity on the part of the soldiers, and on Thursday evening the town of Coleford was full of them. They went to the different houses to ask for food and drink, which, from the strengthened idea of the legality of their proceeding were freely given.

Thus, with spirits elate with drink, the hope of conquest, they sallied forth running to the spot where the soldiers were quietly maintaining their watch, with a tremendous shout. No language can do justice to the feelings of the inhabitants in this crisis, as it was fully expected a serious disturbance would ensue; but they contented themselves with shouting, talking and laughing, at what they termed "ragged regiment," until about twelve, o'clock, when they all retired in peace.

The next day the small military party were very prudently marched out of the place, as it was evident their presence only served to make "darkness visible," or, in other words, to show how futile was their power. Their departure was no sooner announced in the Forest, than the most enthusiastic joy was felt. They considered that they had now completely prevailed; and their rights were by this bold effort restored them. They looked on themselves as masters, where they had long been servants; this they expressed by pushing round the cider (we do not say the glass), with the greatest hilarity. One proposed the health of their champion, "Warry,"— another, "Confusion to all foreigners,"—and a third, more inclined to be witty, ex-claimed, "Let us not trample on a vanquished enemy; here is a quick march and better quarters to the ragged regiment." This was drunk with loud and repeated cheers.

They then proceeded to the house of Mr. Gold, where they soon levelled his boundaries with the ground, turning in the cattle to browse on the flowers and shrubs which surrounded his dwelling, remarking they would teach, the foreigners to come and drive over them.

They afterwards divided themselves into parties of about a hundred each, one of which was dispatched to the residence of Mr. Gething, the sub-agent for the Park End collieries. They told him they were come to pull down his bounds. Mr. Gething, who had wheat round, his house; calmly represented to them the injury he should sustain, if the wall was taken down: Let it stand," said he, "until, my wheat is in, and then I pledge my word (and you all know you may depend on me), to take it down immediately, and lay it open to you." Some were for proceeding with their work, but the majority were in favour of the speaker, and they left his property untouched.

Another party proceeded to the residence of Mr. Turnbull, one of the Forest keepers or as they are generally called, woodmen where they began to demolish his bounds. Mr. Turnbull came out and expostulate with them, as his wife was at the time in a dangerous state of health, and he very justly dreaded the consequences that might result from such measures. They were no sooner apprised of this, than they, to a man, turned about, and walked quietly away—one of them remarking, "We don't want to harm: the woman; but it is to her you owe your escape—for mind—soon as she's well, we'll have 'em all down, mind that."

So active and so unanimous were they in their undertakings, that by Saturday night; there was scarcely a mile of unbroken wall to be seen in the whole Forest. To look at the destruction of so much boundary in so limited a period of time, would scarcely admit of belief, and particularly from their extreme strength, as in many places they appeared fit for fortifications, but in three days were level with the earth. It. was reported on Saturday evening, that a regiment of horses would enter the Forest the next day, to put a stop to any further proceedings. This report becoming current, they called a council of war when all swore to stand to a man. Warry endeavoured to inspire them with fresh courage, "We have nothing to fear, for not only, the King, but the duke of Beaufort is on our side—he is the poor man's friend, and will see us righted". They continued at work, men, women, and children, until, a late hour.

Several farmers had with the most premature boldness driven their cattle to the Forest, and expressed their delight that the pastures, so long the property of the crown, were now become public. Some, more rural in their taste, set up a gipsy tent, and entertained their braver friends with compliments on that achievement they were themselves too cowardly to engage in, but of the benefits of which none were more eager to partake. But those high-flushed expectations were now to be broken in upon.

Scarcely had the inhabitants of Coleford returned from their church on the Sunday morning, when their ideas were diverted in afresh channel by the imposing appearance of the advanced guard of the third; a regiment of dragoons. In a moment all was anxiety and dread, as to what might be the result of this visit. It was our brave defenders, our countrymen, that were entering—but for what purpose? to destroy perhaps our friends and brothers, or to fall by their hands—in either case, how dreadful. It had been reported to the commanding officer that the inhabitants of Coleford were in the utmost dismay, and added, "Put your men on the trot, or ere you get there the streets will run with blood." They, therefore, advanced with drawn swords, prepared for what was revolting to their feelings (intestine broils), but were pleasingly surprised on their entrance to find the town in perfect peace, and without the slightest personal fear, as they were in the most perfect cordiality with their neighbours; and though their present mode of conduct was of a formidable nature, yet they felt they were in no danger from their proceedings as far as regarded themselves.

Warry was perhaps the least of all concerned. He attended the services of the Church at Park End twice that day, and talked of the entry of the soldiers with the greatest coolness. "They want to frighten us," said he, "but we have nothing to fear; let me only live free till after next Thursday, and then I don't mind what all the regiments in England can do; only stand firm, that's all".

At an early hour on Monday, his grace the duke of Beaufort, the marquis of Worcester, and every magistrate and gentleman of influence in the neighbourhood, assembled at the head inn in the town of Coleford, to take into consideration the measures necessary to be adopted for putting a stop to the further destruction of property in the Forest. Several from Monmouth, together with some of the inhabitants of the town, were sworn in as special constables.  The party of foot that were before marched out, returned again to remain in the town. Two police officers from London arrived to assist in the apprehension of the offenders. Several scouts who had been sent out into the Forest; returned with information that they were still continuing their work undismayed. Hundreds upon hundreds were busily employed in the various parts, and the order for the day was, to have up the railways, and take down the keepers' lodges and woodmen's houses, erected by order of government. This bold avowal called for an immediate and effective measure, as the interest and even lives of individuals would in that case be laid open to danger.

It was first proposed to get possession of the person of Warry, and the other ring-leaders, to interrogate the former as to his authority, that, if possible, those persons who had misled him, might be brought to suffer the punishment so justly their due. The appearance of the town was that of a seat of war, and there seemed to be a suspension of all business. At nine, the select party set out in the following order;—first, the special constables—next, a large party of the woodmen—then, the marquis of Worcester, and several gentlemen, who felt themselves called upon on this occasion; the company of the third dragoon guards followed, with a great number of the inhabitants: To a country so unused to military display, the imposing appearance of the third dragoons produced a powerful effect.

Two lads, who had accompanied as spectators, were seen to run forward for the purpose of giving the alarm, when P. Ducarel, esq. (who had before observed them very busy in demolishing the fences), ordered them into custody, and they were sent back into the town to be detained for examination. Feelings of consternation now pervaded every heart, as it was confidently expected that the Foresters would not give place, so that bloodshed on the one side, or both, appeared inevitable. This period of suspense was broken in upon by a request, that a party might be sent to Ruardean Hill, to prevent further damage, as, though they were aware the military were advancing, continued at work with increased vigour. The Foresters, true to their several appointments on the Monday morning, looked round in vain for their friend and champion. He was not to be found; and on enquiry, a friend of his informed them, that it would be their ruin if he was taken prisoner before Thursday, but then he would come forward and assert their rights. How far this gained ground among them is not known; he was not there to invigorate them, and by the time the party reached the Forest, not a man was to be seen. The disappearance of their champion had raised some doubt in their minds, as to the legality of their claims.

A small party of soldiers accompanied the marquis of Worcester to the house of Warry, but he was not to be seen, though the bed was still warm, and his watch in the window going, so that it was evident he had but just made his retreat as the party were advancing. The officers immediately proceeded to search the house; and opening a small box several letters were discovered, which were written by the duke of Beaufort, endeavouring to dissuade him from his purpose, telling him to lay his own and neighbours' grievances before government, and not to bring himself and them into trouble, by acting, so contrary to the laws. These letters being made public, the fabric on which these poor deluded men rested fell to the ground.

They had been given to understand that the noble duke was agreeable to their proceedings, but they were now undeceived, and fully concluded that there existed no foundation whatever for their former high dependence; their intentions were frustrated, their hopes destroyed—and those very men, who but yesterday were lifted to the clouds with the hopes of success, to-day were seeking a hiding place in the most secret recesses of the very lands they had hoped to pass their lives on with tranquillity, as the undisputed masters.

About the middle day, the party returned with seven prisoners, who were brought in handcuffed to the legs of the soldiers; they were put in confinement at the Angel inn, and consisted merely of those who had been engaged with the others, but none of the principals in the riots. In the afternoon another party went out to Ruardean Hill, but returned with only one man as prisoner, who though they had continued their depredations until the forces appeared in view, yet contrived to evade their pursuit. It was a heart rending spectacle to behold mothers, wives, and children, waiting in the street the return of the several parties, dreading lest they should behold their beloved relatives brought in manacled, yet fearful of betraying their feelings, aware it would be exposing them to still greater danger—but the agonized look and stifled sob plainly spoke, "Is he with them?" One poor woman, whose only son (her sole dependence), was taken, was obliged to have a chair brought her, for at the sight of him she had sank overpowered by the pressure of her calamity.

Several were seen following the soldiers, enquiring, "What will be done to them?" who with that spirit of courtesy for which the third dragoons are so eminently distinguished, endeavoured to afford consolation to the poor sufferers, by assuring them that the punishment of those then in custody would be very light. Indeed the conduct of this body of men cannot be too highly spoken of; the calm humane deportment, their regret at being obliged to act against their countrymen, and yet their firm adherence to the line of conduct it was deemed proper to adopt, united to the universal good behaviour and polished manners of each individual, caused them to be treated at every house with the most affectionate respect, even where their presence was an actual inconveniency. Orders being given for them to proceed some to the Speech House, others to different stations round the Forest, they were parted from with the utmost regret, and a regiment of foot came in, to assist in the apprehension of other of the offenders; these had orders to be ready at a moment's notice for marching.

Tuesday, the party stationed at the Speech House brought in more prisoners.

Wednesday, intelligence was received that Warren James would give himself up, if bail could be taken for him. This, after a meeting of magistrates had been convened to consider of it, was refused, as the nature of his offence was such as to render it highly improper. Communications being received that Warry was supposed to have taken refuge in a coal pit; at a short distance from the place where he resided, a party of the foot soldiers were taken to the Forest, for the purpose of apprehending him, but how to get at him was the grand point to be considered. It was not known who were his companions in such a place, and these who descended would be entirely in their power, but this was obviated by information gained (by the man who was found hardy enough to head them in this enterprise), respecting a signal given by the sister of Warry. About twelve at night this signal was given by William Watkins from the mouth of the pit, when the voice of Warry, with which he was well acquainted, called out, "All right" he was answered by the same, words, "All right!" and immediately drawn to bank.

As the soldiers were, agreeable to the orders they had received, lying on the ground, he did not immediately perceive his danger, until the muscular gripe of Watkins startled him to a sense of his situation. He directly exclaimed, "I am betrayed". Although instantly surrounded by the soldiers, he did not lose his presence of mind, but said calmly to the captain of the regiment, "I'm betray'd by treachery; was not this the case, nine hundred men would have surrounded and defended me with the last drop of their blood! but do your duty; I have nothing to fear." He was brought in before the people were stirring, and properly secured. Being asked if he would not like to exchange his pit dress, which was almost as black as the coal he worked, he replied, looking at his sleeve, "No, I shan't; my dress is good enough for the company I am going in." When brought before the magistrates, he evinced not the slightest trepidation; nor could anything be elicited from him to throw further light on the subject; he merely said, "If I have done wrong, I, not you, must suffer." He was then conveyed to Gloucester castle, escorted by a party of dragoons. Here, then, was the decisive blow to all his followers, who beheld their errors at too late a period to retrieve them. They saw that the advice given them by Mr. Machen was in the spirit of truth and friendship, but 'twas only believed when it could not benefit them. Their hopes of future good were exchanged for certain present evil. Their wives and children must for a time be left to the mercy of the world, and themselves either prisoners or exiles.

Several more were taken in the course of the next day; but as Coleford fair was on the 20th of June, the regiment had orders to leave the town, to make room for those who were expected on that occasion at the several inns; they therefore proceeded to the different stations assigned them in the neighbouring villages. Each succeeding day added to the number of prisoners, and though the neighbourhood was restored to a sort of tranquillity, yet the sufferings of the poor Foresters were such as to affect every individual with the deepest sympathy. The magistrates at length issued a notice offering pardon to all concerned in pulling down the enclosures, except the actual ring-leaders, if they would give their work—some for the term of a month, others for that of a fortnight; according to the part they had taken in the destruction of the. fences.  This offer was accepted with the utmost gratitude, and most of those who were implicated were thus once more re-stored to their families.

Among the many who were looked upon as ringleaders, the name of John Harris, or as he is better known by that of "Poisefoot," stands conspicuous; not for any prominent part he took in the disturbances, but for the punishment to which his subsequent conduct has exposed him. Perhaps no greater proof can be adduced to show how low human nature can sink, than is exemplified in the life and conduct of this unhappy man: he would, most probably, have rested in obscurity, had his name not been in such a striking manner associated with the Forest disturbances, as to lead to a general supposition that he was himself a forester; but they disown him, and it is their pride that they can with justice do so.

Harris is a native of Wales, but has for several years resided at Berry Hill, a distance of about two miles from Coleford. His character was such as to make him the terror of the neighbourhood—he was a bad husband, a worse father, and a dangerous companion; it was his constant custom to punish his children at night if they could not furnish him with some fruits of their dishonesty during the day.

It is easy to judge what effect this was likely to have upon them; they grew up what he desired to make them. His conduct towards his wife was what might have been expected; alike void of principle or feeling. His methods of raising money were sometimes of a singular nature some of which I will quote.

In the harvest of 1829, he applied to Mr. Teague, a respectable farmer, residing at Carter's Piece, for permission to assist him in reaping his wheat; by that means, to entitle his family to what is called "friendshipping"; that is, to allow them to glean in the fields during the time of cutting the wheat—which liberty is, generally, in this country, granted to the families of those who give their labour on the occasion. Mr. Teague, although he did not like the man, thought it best to be on good terms with him; and, therefore, acceded to his request. He came, and had the modesty to bring only his wife and five children with him.

At night, Mr. Teague informed him that his further services would be dispensed with, as his labour cost him more than he could afford. Mr. Teague saw nothing more of him during the harvest; but some months after, was not a little surprised in receiving a bill, charging him seven shillings per day, for two clays' labour. On Mr. Teague's making enquiry what it was for, he answered, "For reaping." But," said he, "'did not all your family lease?"—(glean). "That," said Harris, "argues nothing; and as for you not seeing me on the second day—Why, I was on ground if you did not, and if you don't pay; me, I'll put you in St. Briavels Court for the money." He kept his word, but was thrown, with costs. At the same period, he had a trial with a Mr. Raiford, for the payment of a hogshead of cider, which he had neither received, or, indeed, ever heard of, until an application was made by Harris for the money.

But this being, sunk so low, was an object of intense interest to the excellent and indefatigable minister of the church of Berry Hill, (the Rev. Mr. Garnsey,) who endeavoured, by every possible means he could devise, to awaken this wretched man to a sense of his awful situation; but all its vain. He sometimes seemed to feel, and always appeared thankful; so powerful is advice given in the spirit of true Christian affection; but his conduct remained unaltered: he could never be prevailed upon to pay a debt, unless compelled by law.

The disturbances in the Forest were such as in effects, not in cause, suited his peculiar taste: he was one of the foremost with his tongue and hands, but like the others, made his escape from the scene of action, and retired home; where he was heard to swear, he would not be taken alive. A warrant was issued for his apprehension; but the known desperation of his character, made this undertaking to be looked upon in no very pleasing point of view. But William Watkins, the same who apprehended Warry, and who had been sworn in a special constable, had hardihood enough in his composition for offices however difficult and perilous; and he proceeded (accompanied by a keeper, of the name of Powell), to Harris's house. A person, named Smith, also repaired there, to assist in his apprehension.

As they approached the house, Harris was eating his dinner: Watkins said, "Harris, I have a warrant against you, for pulling down the enclosures." Harris came toward the door, and swore he would stick the knife he held into the first that came inside the house. Watkins, who was a man of a resolute turn of mind, was not to be deterred by threats, and he entered, followed by his assistants. "Harris", said he, "you had better be quiet, and come along with me: you may easily get out of it by doing a little work, or finding bail at sessions." Harris replied, "Who the devil will be bail for me? Get out, I tell thee, or it will be worse for all of ye." Watkins replied, "This is of no use; I am come here to take you, and will not quit without you; so come quietly, it is as well." Harris, at that moment, exchanging his knife into his left hand, and thrusting his right under his frock, pulled out a pistol, and swore he would blow out the brains of the first who came near him. He then cocked the pistol. Watkins attempted to get behind, for the purpose of securing him by the arms; but Harris at the moment turned round; exclaiming, "Keep Back!" and snapped the pistol at Watkins's head: a spark flashed close to his eyes. Watkins immediately caught him in his arms, and threw him on the ground. A violent struggle now ensued he was thrown down three several times, and in one of them, his face was cut against a chair; but he was busily employed, even when down, in cocking the pistol, which, alter some struggle, Powell succeeded in wresting from him; but so determined was he, that he made a desperate attempt to regain possession of it. He was then properly secured. Powell unloaded the pistol in the presence of the magistrates: there were two balls, and a great deal of powder in the barrel. Harris complained that ill language had been made use of to provoke him; but this charge is without foundation. He was immediately committed to prison.

Thus, two men, as opposite as human nature could possibly be, became inmates of the same prison, charged with similar offences.

Little did Warry foresee when he stepped forward as the champion of his neighbours' liberties, that he should become for life the associate of such a man as Harris; but we cannot say where we will stop when we overstep the bounds of propriety. The trials which took place at the assize at Glocester, excited considerable interest. Some were of opinion that Warry would, then and there, adduce such reasons for his conduct, as would exonerate him from the charge of riot, but it was not the case; he made no defence, nor did he attempt to implicate his advisers. His counsel (Mr. Charles Phillips) endeavoured to prove that Warren had not remained an hour after the reading of the riot act; but the only thing advanced by himself was, simply to say, he remained but a very short time afterwards. Mr. Justice Patteson overruled this point, as no evidence could be adduced to prove that he did actually retire; and even if he did for a short space of time during the hour, he could not be protected from the penalties of the statute under which he was indicted, if it was proved that he afterwards continued to act in conjunction with the mob. The jury, after a short consultation, found the prisoner guilty; but recommended him to mercy on account of his former good character, which was corroborated by the most unexceptionable evidence: judgment of death was then recorded. Whatever might he the internal feelings of Warry, he maintained his firmness throughout. Although fondly attached to his aged mother, and, as a man of penurious habits, no doubt his cottage and land were also near his heart: he calmly said to one who spoke to him, "I don't care if they hang me, only, let it lead to the good of my countrymen."

Who, that reads these pages, but must feel for the heart-broken widowed mother of a son, who, had his fortitude been evinced in a better cause, might justly have been her pride and boast; but her son she never saw from the time he secreted himself in the pit, to elude his pursuers, nor can she expect it, until she meets him in another world.

Harris, on his trial, attempted to prove that the constables had treated him with undue severity; and his son who was, evidence on the side of his father, swore that he had himself loaded the pistol, to protect the premises which had lately been robbed:—that he had cast the bullets, and placed the pistol on the shelf. The learned judge, in stunning up the evidence, explained the law as laid down in the particular act of parliament by which these men were indicted the jury after a short deliberation, found the prisoner guilty. His lordship then, in a very impressive manner, passed the awful sentence of death upon the unhappy prisoner, without holding out the slightest hope of mercy being extended towards him.

It is a singular and painful fact, that the day this wretched man was placed at the bar, his two sons were suffering the sentence of the law, by being privately whipped, at Monmouth, for stealing in that town; and it is said that one of them, rubbing his shoulders, exclaimed, "Well, this is not half so bad as father used to beat us for not stealing." His wife, with that faith and affection found only in woman, not dismayed by apparent difficulties, got a petition drawn out; and the first person who signed this request That his life might be spared, was William Watkins—the very man he had attempted to deprive of existence. This was followed by many others, and was attended with the desired success.

No sooner was it known that Harris was condemned, than the Rev. Mr. Garnsey, actuated by the true spirit of gospel philanthropy, paid a visit to the prisoner, to see if he could be of any service to the unhappy man; who, no doubt, had been ofttimes the subject of his applications at a throne of grace. His entrance was preceded by that of the chaplain, at whose appearance, the miserable culprit burst into tears; his obdurate heart was broken up with a sense of his offences; and this, almost, hopeless character was now an earnest seeker of divine mercy. Mr. Garnsey was deeply affected at the scene before him—he approached him —"Ah! Harris," said he, "had you listened to me, you would not now have been here." He admitted the truth of this remark, and told him, that he had never ceased to pray for mercy since he had been there, and that his prayers had not been unavailing.

During the further conversation that, ensued; the reprieve, which had been granted; arrived at the prison. But no language can do justice to the scene of that moment: he fell on his knees, and, when utterance was given, they poured forth their united, their heartfelt thanksgivings at the throne of grace. Mr. Garnsey then proceeded to give him such advice as would tend to strengthen the powerful awakenings produced by the near prospect of death. Previous to his taking leave of the prisoner, Mr. Garnsey asked him if he had any message to send to his neighbours and friends. He replied, "Yes, remember me to them all." "That," said this excellent man, "is not what I want, Harris; have you no word of warning or advice to give them "He then desired him to tell them to keep the sabbath, for it was first to sabbath breaking he laid all his misery—to look at him, and take warning not to be content with merely coming to church on a sabbath day; with other words of admonition, which were faithfully and affectionately delivered to the people on his return, and there was scarcely a dry eye perceptible among his crowded auditors,  when he delivered the solemn warning of a, man, whom they, for perhaps the first time, regarded with sentiments of pity and regret.

It was a remark of the late Lord Gage, that actual poverty was unknown in the Forest of Dean. —"The poorest among them," said his lordship, " is better off than any town mechanic; and the richer are petty princes, living on their own lands, rent and tax free." But the face of things is now altered: sorrow and woe is to be found in their dwellings, and many and bitter are the tears shed for the fate of those beloved friends from whom they are separated. We trust these awful warnings will deter others from giving up their better judgment to those, who only lure them to destroy, by selling their advice as legal, and living on the hard earned penny of the poor.

That the Foresters will retrieve their characters as peaceable subjects, no doubt exists; and may they be renowned, as they ever have been, for open warm-hearted hospitality. They are highly privileged with pious ministers. In the true spirit of friendship, it is the desire of all who wish them well, that in future emergencies they would ask their advice, and be governed by their directions, who have no other interest than that of leading them to happiness in this life, and eternal felicity in a world to come.

It is not generally known how much praise is due to Edward Machen, Esq., for his efforts and influence in the mitigation of the offenders' sentences. Be regarded those poor men as friends and neighbours and to him it is owing, that some now suffering imprisonment are not banished for ever from all a Forester holds dear—his wife, his children, and his native woods.
