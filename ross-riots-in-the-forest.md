Riots in the Forest of Dean

"Monmouth, Friday Morning.

"There is at present a strong popular excitement in the Forest of Dean. A great portion of the Forest was enclosed and planted with oak, under an Act passed in 48th of George III., which plantations are now in a thriving state. The act provides that 11,000 acres are always to be kept inclosed as a nursery for timber: and that the nursery can only be legally opened by order of the Lords of the Treasury,  and that only when the young timber shall be safe for the browsing of the cattle sheep, and swine. An erroneous opinion, however, prevails among the foresters, that the inclosures should' be thrown open at the expiration of 21 years, and as the Act was passed in 1808 several of the enclosures are of a longer standing, and great dissatisfaction has been for some time felt at their continuance, and about a fortnight since a portion of the embankment was secretly destroyed. A large reward was offered for the discovery of the offenders, without effect, and hand bills were circulated, cautioning against the recurrence of similar outrages. On Wednesday morning a body of men, about eighty commenced levelling the embankments. In the course of the day their numbers increased to 500. On Thursday they continued the work of devastation, and their numbers increased to 2,000, parties being sent out in all directions to compel the colliers and other workmen to come and assist in opening the enclosures. Several miles of fences were levelled in these two days. The men worked regularly with suitable implements. Thev offered no injury to persons or private property, anil were particularly careful of the young timber. There was no military force in the neighbourhood beyond a body of about 50 men, consisting of the staff of the Monmouth Militia and a recruiting party. This small body marched towards the forest on Friday morning. There is no political feeling mixed up with the question of supposed local rights. There are reformers and anti reformers both amongst the foresters, and amongst those who were using their best endeavours to check their proceedings. The accounts from Merthyr continue favourable. The men have returned to their work. Mr. Crawshay's family have returned home—a strong indication of the restoration of order. The number killed, as gathered from the best information, is stated at seventeen or eighteen, including those who have died of their wounds."

Extract of a letter from Pontypool, Monmouthshire received in Shrewsbury yesterday by a tradesman, to whom are indebted tor the information it conveys:—

"Pontypool, Tuesday Morning, Two o'Clock.

"An old man has just come running in, sweating and breathless, to say that the rioters were at Nantyglo, nine miles from here. He had escaped from them. If they catch any that refuse to join them they cut off iheir ears. They are now two miles from here at Abersychan and much mischief is expected. They have threatened to pull down an iron master's house; and this town is all up in arms expecting the worst. It is said there are more than six thousand on their way here. The mob have taken several cannon, made a temporary battery, mounted tor regular siege; and built walls across the roads as high as a house. They are gathered from all quarters for a struggle."

There may be some little exaggeration, arising from personal fear, in the above letter. His Majesty's Ministers have given directions to the troops and soldiers in the vicinity, to march to the spot; and have no doubt the affair will soon be ended. What can misguided combinations of workmen expect, but misery, poverty, and death, as the result of combinations–*Shreswbury Chronocle.*

FOREST OF DEAN. ARRIVAL OF THE MILITARY-DISPERSION OF THE LEVELLERS AND APPREHENSION OF THE RINGLEADERS. Our account of the proceedings in the Forest of Dean last week was necessarily concluded at a very interesting crisis, like an act in some dramatic entertainment, where the curtain drops upon a scene of great excitement, leaving the imagination upon the fret, until the time arrives for its further development.
