Little Fairly

LITTLE FAIRLY.

is the title of an Irish legend, related with much humour by Samuel Lover, which is even as widespread as the story of the Robbery of the King's Treasury, to which indeed it is closely allied:

Once upon a time there was a farmer who had two wives — for in those days a man could have more than one wife at a time — by one of whom he had a son, who was very sharp-witted, and was called, from his diminutive size, Little Fairly; by the other he had a son of huge dimensions, and as stupid as his half-brother was clever. The old man left all his possessions to his big son, with the exception of one poor cow, which he bequeathed to Little Fairly, desiring his favourite son to allow it to graze on his land. The big brother, however, grudging even this small concession, contrives to cause the death of Little Fairly's cow, for he bore him a bitter hatred. Then Little Fairly takes off the skin of the wretched animal, and splitting it in a few places puts into them some shillings, and goes away to market, where he demands a hundred guineas for it, which

There is another Irish version, in which a poor fellow called Darby Daly puts some coins in his grey horse's dung, and pretends that he thus produces money. Mr Purcell buys the horse of him; and when he comes to revenge himself for the cheat, and • have the rascal hung,

 The Norse tale of "Big Peter and Little Peter" is own brother to the Irish legend of Little Fairly, but varies somewhat in the earlier details. Little Peter's sole possession is a calf, which his big brother kills, because it grazed in his field. Having taken off the skin and dried it, Little Peter goes away to sell it, but no one would buy such a tattered thing

A considerably amplified version of the droll incident of Little Peter and the priest in the chest is found in the once-popular 'History of Friar Bush,' as follows:

In a Danish variant of our story, entitled "Great Glaus and Little Glaus," the hero and his enemy are not brothers, merely neighbours. Little Glaus has but one horse, and Great Glaus has four horses. All the week Little Glaus ploughed for Great Glaus, and on Sunday he had leave to

In a second Norwegian version, the king one day asks the hero ("Peik") to show him some of his tricks, but he says he has left his "fooling-rods" at home. The king lends him his horse to go and fetch them, and the trickster rides off to the next town and sells the horse and the saddle. He afterwards persuades the king to buy a boiler that could boil porridge without a fire; and when the king discovers he has been again tricked and goes to punish him, he induces him to buy the chopping-block to set the boiler on in place of a fire

As might be expected, the story is also current among the people of Iceland, but in a form so different from any of the versions already cited, that a pretty full abstract of it is necessary for comparison with variants that are to follow. The hero of the Icelandic legend is a young smith named Sigurdr, who had in his early youth been a playmate of the king's two sons, but when the princes grew up they treated him harshly, for which he paid them off with clever tricks.

One of the four Gaelic versions given by Campbell in his 'Popular Tales of the West Highlands' (vol. ii. p. 218) is rather inaptly entitled "The Three Widows," since they are only mentioned in the opening sentence: "There were three widows, and every one of them had a son apiece. Domhnull was the name of the son of one of them."

LITTLE FAIRLY (p. 229).

In a paper on Aberdeenshire Folk-Lore, contributed to the 'Folk-Lore Journal,' vol. ii. (1884), pp. 70, 71, by the Rev. Walter Gregor, there is a story, entitled "Mally Whuppie," communicated to him by Mr James Moir, rector of the Grammar School, Aberdeen, who heard it told by his mother, which presents points of resemblance to versions of the Robbery of the King's Treasury, and in the conclusion bears some analogy to the incident of the sack in the variants of Little Fairly:

The heroine, Mally Whuppie, first steals a giant's sword from the back of his bed, next, his purse from below his pillow, and each time escapes; but in stealing the ring from off his finger the giant awakes and grasps her by the hand. "Now," says the giant, "I hae catcht you, Mally Whuppie; and if I had deen as muckle ill to you as ye hae deen to me, what wad ye dae to me?" Mally considered what plan she would fall upon to escape, and she said, "I wad pit you into a pyock (poke),1 and I wad pit the cat inside wi' you, and the dog aside you, and a needle and thread and a sheers, and I wad hang you upon the

1 The y in this word is pronounced as in "yoke," "yard," etc. 

wa', and I wad gang to the wood and wile (choose) the thickest stick I could get, and I wad come hame and tak you down and lay upon you till ye were dead." "Well, Mally," says the giant, "I'll just do that to you." So he gets a pyock and puts Mally into it, and the cat and the dog beside her, and a needle and thread, and shears, and hings her up upon the wa', and goes to the wood to choose a stick. Mally sings, "O gin ye saw faht (what) I see!" "O faht div ye see, Mally?" says the giant's wife. But Mally never said a word but "O gin ye saw faht I see!" The giant's wife pleaded that Mally would take her up into the pyock till she would see what Mally saw. So Mally took the shears and cut a hole in the pyock and took out the needle and thread with her, and jumpt down, and helpit the giant's wife up into the pyock, and sewed up the hole. The giant's wife saw nothing, and began to ask to get down again, but Mally never minded, but hid herself at the back of the door. Home came the giant, and a great big tree in his hand, and he took down the pyock and began to lay upon it. His wife cried, "It's me, man"; but the dog barkit, and the cat mewt, and he did not know his wife's voice. But Mally did not want her to be killed, so she came out from the back of the door, and the giant saw her and he after her; and he ran and she ran, till she came to the "Brig o' the ae hair," and she wan (got) ower, but he coudna (couldn't), and he said, "Wae worth you, Mally Whuppie! let you never come again!" "Never mair, carle," quo' she, "will I come again to Spain." So Mally took the ring to the king, and she was married to his youngest son, and never saw the giant again.

Another analogue of the sack-trick of Little Fairly is found in the Norwegian tale of the Master-Smith (Thorpe's 'Yule-Tide Stories,' p. 272), in which the hero, personating an angel, persuades the priest that he will take him to heaven in a holy sack: "On Monday the Master-Smith appeared again as an angel, and the priest fell on his knees and returned thanks previous to being put in the sack; and when he was well in, the Master-Smith pulled and hauled him over stock and stone. 'Oh, oh,' cried the priest in the sack, 'where are you taking me to?' 'This is the narrow way that leads to the kingdom of heaven,' said the Master-Smith, dragging him on till he had almost killed him. At length he threw him into the Amtman's goose-house, and the geese began to hiss and peck at him so that he was more dead than alive. 'Oh, oh, where am I now ?' said the priest. 'Now you are in purgatory for the purpose of being purged and purified for everlasting life,' said the Master-Smith, and went his way, taking all the gold, silver, and valuables which the priest had collected together in his large parlour. Next morning, when the maid came into the goose-house to let out the geese, she heard the priest in the sack wailing and lamenting bitterly. In the name of Jesus, who are you and what do you want?' said she. 'Oh,' cried the priest, 'if thou art an angel from heaven, let me out and allow me to go back to earth again, for here it is worse than hell itself; little devils are pinching me with their tongs.' 'God mend us,' said the girl, helping the priest out of the sack, 'I am no angel; I tend the Amtman's geese, and they are the little devils that have been pecking at you, father.' 'Oh,' cried the priest, 'this is the work of the Master-Smith! Oh my gold and silver and all my fine clothes!' and he ran home lamenting so woefully that the girl thought he had lost his senses."
