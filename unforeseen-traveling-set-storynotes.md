__Tales:__

- *Wish Ring* [frame tale] — a tale I first heard from Daniel Morden via his podcast during lockdown, I traced it back to a German tale from 1871. Using it as a frame tale is my contribution in this set. [`the-wish-ring.html`]

- *Stone soup* — a "standard" story, widely told, in many variants; see my notes at. [`axe-porridge-stone-soup.html`]

- *Tinker King Lamp* — a tale I found in a collection of tales orally collected from Duncan Williamson, *The King And The Lamp: Scottish Traveller Tales*. I did hear Duncan telling tales back in the day at *Festival at the Edge*, but I don't specifically recall having heard him tell this one.

- *Sweetseller Lamp* — a tale I found in Richard Hamilton's *The Last Storytellers: Tales from the Heart of Morocco*, a treasure trove of a book gifted to me by my fellow *'Tis Tales* teller, Holly Medland.

- *Too much time* — originally a legal anecdote, I stumbled across this tale, somewhen, as I was looking for stories that particularly related to time. It is still very much a work in progress. [`too_much_time.html`]
