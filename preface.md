# Preface

This set of storynotes, and the associated repository, represents work-in-progress notes relating to stories I have told or that I'm working up with an intention of telling.

Elements of the online book pages are rather more polished than the raw original notes in the base repository, although some of the online book pages may also include raw notes.

All the pages in this set of storynotes are subject to being moved to other repositories and storynote collections.
