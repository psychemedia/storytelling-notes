# Kett's Rebellion

Once, there was a King. A young king. A king who had already been a king for two years, despite still only being a boy, just eleven years of age.

Even in the time of once, this was still quite young for a King. So a council was a appointed to act on his behalf, and chief amongst his advisers, for now at least, was his Protector, his uncle.

One day, a letter arrived, a petition. The commoners were complaining again and it fell to the King's uncle to answer them.

"So how many demands this time?" he asked, and the secretary counted through them. "1, 2, 3, 4, huh, huh, 13, 14, hmm, huh, 26, 27, 28; no, 29: 29, sir." 

[Sigh] "29? *FFS.* About what exactly? No, not exactly, there's too many for exactly, we'll be here all day. Ish. What are they wittering on about now, ish?"

The secretary skimmed through them:

Kett's Rebellion was a historical event in 1549 when a group of commoners, led by Robert Kett and Thomas Cod, staged a protest against various oppressive practices and demands made by the authorities of their time. The rebellion's main grievances were as follows:

1. **Enclosure of Common Lands:** The rebels requested that the recently enacted laws on land enclosure not harm those who had already enclosed saffron fields because it had been a significant financial investment for them. They also demanded that no more land be enclosed.

2. **Unjust Rent Charges:** The lords of manors had imposed certain free rent charges on their tenants, which they sought to pass on to the freeholders, contrary to what was considered right.

3. **Restriction on Lords' Commons Rights:** The rebels asked that lords of manors should not have the right to use common lands.

4. **Land Ownership by Clergy:** They insisted that priests should not buy or own lands, and the lands they already had should be leased to laypeople, as it was in the first year of King Henry VII's reign.

5. **Pricing of Land:** They wanted the prices of red and meadow lands to be the same as they were in the first year of King Henry VII's reign.

6. **Marshy Lands Pricing:** The rebels requested that marshy lands held by the king or others be priced as they were in the first year of King Henry VII's reign.

7. **Standardized Measurement:** They called for all bushels in the kingdom to be of the same size, specifically eight gallons.

8. **Qualifications for Priests:** Priests who couldn't preach effectively and promote the word of God should be removed from their positions, and parishioners or patrons should choose replacements.

9. **Collection of Certain Rents:** They demanded that certain rents, like castellward rent and blanche fermes, traditionally collected from tenants, should be paid by the lords and not the tenants.

10. **Dovecote Ownership:** Only those with ancient customs should be allowed to maintain dovecotes.

11. **Common Land Use:** They wanted all freeholders and copyholders to have access to common lands and their benefits.

12. **Local Office Appointments:** They asked that local officers (feodaries) not be counselors to anyone in their office-making process, to ensure fair service to the king.

13. **Lete Court Control:** The rebels requested that the king take control of all liberties of lete, ensuring that people could enjoy their common lands and benefits freely.

14. **Reasonable Rents:** Copyhold lands with unreasonable rents should be priced as they were in the first year of King Henry VII, and fines upon tenant deaths or sales should be moderate.

15. **Resident Priests:** Priests should reside on their benefices to instruct parishioners in God's laws.

16. **Freedom of Bondsmen:** All bondmen should be made free, as Christ made everyone free through His bloodshed.

17. **River Access:** Rivers should be open and common for all to fish and use for passage.

18. **Office Eligibility:** No one below the rank of knight or esquire should hold any office unless they have an annual income of over £10.

19. **Mariners' Rights:** Poor mariners and fishermen should receive the full profits from their fishing, including valuable catches like porpoises, grampuses, whales, and large fish, as long as it doesn't harm the king's interests.

20. **Education for the Poor:** Proprietary parsons or vicars with benefices of £10 or more should teach poor children in their parishes the Catechism and the Primer.

21. **Land Purchases by Lords:** Lords should not be allowed to freely buy and lease out lands, which would harm the interests of the king's subjects.

22. **Tithe Reduction:** Proprietary parsons or vicars should only receive 8 pence per noble as full payment for all tithes, settling disputes with their parishioners.

23. **Rabbit Keeping:** No one below the rank of esquire should keep rabbits on their lands unless they fence them in, to avoid causing harm to the commons.

24. **Marriage Choice:** Every person, regardless of their status, should have the right to choose their own marriage partner, except for those under the king's wardship.

25. **Local Bailiffs:** Only a landowner should serve as the lord's bailiff.

26. **Spiritual Promotions:** Lords, knights, and gentlemen should not lease or profit from spiritual promotions.

27. **Legal Reforms:** The rebels asked for a commission to be appointed to reform unjust laws, statutes, proclamations, and other proceedings hidden by local officials since the reign of King Henry VII.

28. **Compensation for Offended Officers:** Officers who had offended the rebels should pay them four pence per day while the rebels were assembled.

29. **Livestock Grazing Restrictions:** Landowners with incomes of £40 or more should not be allowed to graze or raise bullocks or sheep unless it was for household provisioning.

Kett's Rebellion was a significant event in English history, representing the grievances of commoners against unfair practices imposed by the ruling class and the authorities of the time.

ChatGPT clarification:

n historical English legal terminology, a "lete" or "court leet" was a type of court that had jurisdiction over certain local matters and was typically held at the manor level or within a particular jurisdiction. The term "lete" is derived from the Old English word "gelǣte," which means "to let or allow."

Here are some key points about a "lete" or "court leet":

Local Jurisdiction: A lete court had authority over various local issues within its jurisdiction. This could include enforcing certain laws and regulations, settling disputes among residents, and ensuring the maintenance of public order and standards.

Manorial Courts: In many cases, lete courts were associated with manors, which were large estates owned by lords or landowners. These courts were often held by the lord or his appointed officials.

Criminal and Civil Matters: Leete courts had a dual role in addressing both criminal and civil matters. They could deal with minor criminal offenses, such as theft or disturbances, as well as civil disputes related to property, contracts, and local customs.

Appointments and Presentments: In some instances, individuals known as "constables" were appointed to serve as local law enforcement officers and present cases to the lete court. These constables played a role in maintaining order and reporting violations of local regulations.

Customary Laws: The decisions and judgments made in lete courts were often based on customary laws and local customs that had evolved over time. These customs varied from one jurisdiction to another and were not necessarily consistent across the country.

Decline: Over time, the significance and jurisdiction of lete courts began to decline, particularly as centralized legal systems and more formalized courts of law and equity became established. By the 19th century, lete courts had largely lost their legal authority.

Modern Usage: While lete courts no longer have a legal role in contemporary legal systems, the term "court leet" is still used in some places for ceremonial or historical purposes. These events may reenact traditional court proceedings and are often organized as a form of historical recreation or cultural preservation.

In summary, a lete or court leet was a historical local court with jurisdiction over various matters within a specific jurisdiction, often associated with manors and based on customary laws and local customs. These courts played a role in maintaining order and resolving disputes at the local level in medieval and early modern England.
