__Mumby__, near Alford. *The Farmer and the Boggart*. — ‘T' boggart, a squat hairy man, strong as a six-year-old horse, and with arms almost as long as tackle poles, comes to a farmer who has just taken a bit of land, and declares that he is the proper owner, and the farmer must quit. The farmer proposes an appeal to the law, but boggart will have naught to do wi' law, which has never yet done him justice, and suggests that they should share the produce equally. "Very well," says the farmer, "wilt thou tek what grows above ground, or what grows beneath ground? Only, moind, thou mun stick to what thou sattles; oi doant want no back-reckunnings after." He arranges to take what grows above ground, and the farmer promptly sets potatoes. Of course, when the boggart comes at harvest time to claim his share he gets nothing but the haulms and twitch, and is in a sore taking. At last, however, he agrees to take all that grows beneath ground for next season, whereupon the farmer sows wheat, and when boggart comes round at t' backend, the man gets corn and straw, and naught is left for boggart but the stubble. Boggart then insists that next year wheat should be sown again, and that they should mow together, each taking what he mows. The farmer consults the local wise man, and studs boggart's 'falls' with thin iron rods, which wear down boggart's strength in cutting and take all the edge of his scythe. So boggart stops to whet, and boggart stops to rest, but the farmer mows steadily on till at last the boggart throws down his scythe in despair and says, "Ye may tek t' mucky owd land an' all 'ats on it; I wean't hev no more to do wi' it." And off he goes and nivver comes back no more, leastways not after no land, but awms aboot t' delves, an' skears loane foaks o' noights; an' if thou leaves thy dinner or thy tools about, ofttimes he meks off wi' 'em.' — Heanley, p. 4. `[Heanley.

THE BOGIE.

The Bogie was the household spirit; the same with the Robin Goodfellow and Bogle of other parts of England. He played the same part among the old farm-houses and granges of Northamptonshire as the Brownies and Nisses did among the homesteads of Scotland and Sweden. His dwarfish stature, though somewhat larger than the ordinary race of elves, and his extreme love of mischief, show his connection with the other members of the same family. That he was a merry and jovial sprite we know from the proverb, to laugh like old Bogie," or the old proverbial saying, He caps Bogie," spoken of a person who is boisterously enjoying himself: often amplified to—

"He caps Bogie, Bogie capt Redcap, Redcap capt Nick."

Thus reducing the last-mentioned personage to the lowest point in the scale of conviviality. Our goblin does not appear to have been of so beneficent a character as the Highland Browny, who formed a valuable appendage to the household, and whose services were, at least, worth the "creame-bowl, duly set." His operations were, for the most part, confined to the grievously tormenting the family in whose abode he had taken up his residence. He it was whose nocturnal revels in some lonely garret, produced those never-to-be-explained sounds which chilled the hearts of superstitions servant-maids. But the cellar was the apartment in which he chiefly delighted; there he reigned supreme, and, as old legends testify, imbibed the October at a terrible rate.

Among other characteristics of this spirit, was that of superior strength, a quality which he also holds in common with his German and Scandinavian brethren. It is to a being of this class that the village of Stowe, near Daventry, is said to derive its adjunct of "Nine-churches." In days of yore, say the villagers, a lord of the manor was desirous of raising a church in his native place, at that time known by the simple appellation of Stowe. A hill was chosen for the site, cunning workmen procured, and the foundation laid; but on the following morning, when the labour was to be resumed, no traces of the yesterday's work were visible. Trenches, stones, and tools had all vanished. After a long search they were discovered, some distance beyond, on the spot where the present church now stands. The lord, however, was stubborn, and was not to be so easily baffled. Nine times did he renew his attempt, and each time were they frustrated by the spirit, who continued to remove in the night what the workmen had raised during the day. With great difficulty a man was induced to watch these midnight proceedings: and who does the reader imagine were the unseen opponents of the church builders? The tiny legions of Queen Mab, perhaps, as in the case of God's Hill, in the Isle of Wight. But, alas! for the poetry of our rustics, the watchman reported the aggressor as an ol "summet bigger nor a hog." After this the att< was given up in despair, and the present cfiurcli on the site so marvellously selected.

`[Note p. 195-6: A similar tradition attaches itself to the origin of many other buildings throughout Great Britain. Mr. Chambers, in his Popular Rhymes, records many instances of its occurrence in Scotland; and in England we may point out the church of Bughton, in Sussex; Ambrosden Church, in Buckinghamshire ; and that of Rochdale, in Yorkshire. Similar legends are also related of the churches of Great Brington and Oxendon, in this county, both of which, it is said, were originally intended to have been built on sites some distance from the present edifices.`

`Baker assigns a more matter-of-fact origin for the appellation "Nine Churches." **Stowe," he says, "received its adjunct of ' Nine Churches' because there was nine advowsons appendant to the manor."`

`The form of the hog was one of Puck's numerous disguises : thus in the Midsummer Night's Dream, act iii. sc. 1 :—]`

`"Sometimes a horse I'll be, sometimes a bound. A hog, a headless bear, sometimes a fire."`

`So, also in "Robin Goodfellow; his Mad Prankes and Merry Jests", reprinted by the Percy Society:—`

`"Thou has the power to change thy shape, To horse, to hog, to dog, to ape."]`

In spite of the advantages which his spirituality be supposed to have afforded him, he appears to have wanted the superior cunning which characterize more diminutive members of the elfin race. The following legend, very commonly narrated in Northamptonshire, places this in a strong light: — One of these spirits once asserted a claim to a field hitherto possessed by a farmer, and, after much disputing, they came to an arrangement by agreeing to divide its produce between them. At seed-time the farmer asks the Bogie what part of the crop he will have, "tops or bottoms". "Bottoms," said the spirit: upon hearing which his crafty antagonist sows the field with wheat, so that when harvest arrived the corn falls to his share, while the poor Bogie is obliged to content himself with the stubble. Next year the Bogie, finding he had made such an unfortunate selection in the bottoms, chose the "tops;" whereupon the crafty farmer sets the field with turnips — thus, again, outwitting the simple claimant. Tired of this unprofitable farming, the Bogie agrees to hazard his claims on a mowing match,— the land in question to be the stake for which they played. Before the day of meeting the canny earth-tiller procures a number of iron bars, which he strews among the grass to be mown by his opponent; and when the trial commences, the unsuspecting goblin finds his progress retarded by his scythe continually coming into contact with these obstacles, which he takes to be some hard species of dock. "Mortal hard docks these!" said he; "Nation hard docks!" His blunted blade soon brings him to a stand-still; and as, in such cases, it is not allowable for one to sharpen without the other, he turns to his antagonist, now far ahead, and in a tone of despair inquires — "When d'ye wiffle waffle (*whet*), mate?" "Waffle!" said the farmer, with a well-feigned stare of amazement, "oh, about noon, mebby." "Then," said the despairing Bogie, "I've lost my land!" So saying, he disappeared, and the farmer reaped the reward of his artifice by ever afterwards continuing the undisputed possessor of the soil. `[The first part of this tale runs almost word for word with the Danish legend given by Thiele, "How a Farmer tricks a Troll;" and the Story of Rabelais, "How a Junior Devil was fooled by a Husbandman of Pope Figland" (Works, ed. 1807, voL iii. p. 291), but the incident of the mowing is wanting in both. The curious proverb at page 138, which at once introduces us to the principal personages of Northamptonshire mythology, will remind the reader of the German one recorded by Grimm, "To laugh like a Kobold;" or the Norfolk one, preserved by Forby, "To laugh like Robin Goodfellow" spoken of a hearty horse laugh.]`

With the exception of the proverbs and legends, few traces of him remain; and time, which has cast a lenient eye upon his fellows, has been particularly hard upon the domestic spirit. His name, it is true, has yet terrors for unruly children; but what a degradation for a goblin who was formerly the dread of full-grown ones! The same waves among which tradition has assigned a resting place for the disorderly spirits of our ancestors, have also been the place of exile of the Bogies. "What has become of all these spirits?" said we to a promising specimen of the *genus rusticus*, on whom we had been pursuing our researches. "What, arnt you heerd?" was the response. "No," said we, with an ignorant look, expecting to elicit some inedited legend respecting their gradual extinction. "Why, then, I'll tell 'e : a deadly long time ago, the paasons all laid their yeads togither, *and hiked 'em off to the Red Saa*!"

189.— THE PEASANT AND THE DEVIL.

There was once on a time a far-sighted, crafty peasant whose tricks were much talked about. The best story is, however, how he once got hold of the Devil, and made a fool of him. The peasant had one day been working in his field, and as twilight had set in, was making ready for the journey home, when he saw a heap of burning coals in the middle of his field, and when, full of astonishment, he went up to it, a little black devil was sitting on the live coals. "Thou dost indeed sit upon a treasure!" said the peasant. "Yes, in truth," replied the Devil, "on a treasure which contains more gold and silver than thou hast ever seen in thy life!" "The treasure lies in my field and belongs to me," said the peasant. "It is thine," answered the Devil, "if thou wilt for two years give me the half of everything thy field produces. Money I have enough of, but I have a desire for the fruits of the earth." The peasant agreed to the bargain." In order, however, that no dispute may arise about the division," said he, "everything that is above ground shall belong to thee, and what is under the earth to me." The Devil was quite satisfied with that, but the cunning peasant had sown turnips.

Now when the time for harvest came, the Devil appeared and wanted to take away his crop; but he found nothing but the yellow withered leaves, while the peasant, full of delight, was digging up his turnips. "Thou hast had the best of it for once," said the Devil, "but the next time that won't do. What grows above ground shall be thine, and what is under it, mine." "I am willing," replied the peasant; but when the time came to sow, he did not again sow turnips, but wheat. The grain became ripe, and the peasant went into the field and cut the full stalks down to the ground. When the Devil came, he found nothing but the stubble, and went away in a fury down into a cleft in the rocks. "That is the way to cheat the Devil," said the Peasant, and went and fetched away the treasure.


Notes, p463

189. — The Peasant and the Devil.

From the *Büchlein für die Jugend*, pp. 249-251. We have omitted a bad ill-conceived ending in which the Devil and the peasant try which of them can endure the greatest heat; on the other hand a better conclusion to the story is to be found in Müllenhoff, p. 278. When the Devil sees that he is betrayed, he threatens to come the next day but one, when the peasant and he will have a scratching-match with each other. The peasant is afraid, but his wife encourages him, and says that she will soon manage the Devil. The peasant goes away, and when the Devil comes, she says to him, "Just look! my husband has made this great scratch right across my beautiful oak-table with the nail of his little finger!" "Where is he then?" says the Devil. "Where should he be but with the smith? He is having his nails sharpened!" Whereupon the Devil quickly makes off. For a Danish story, see Thiele, 2. 249, where a miner appears. On the other hand, in an Esthonian story (*Reinhart Fuchs*, cclxxxviii), it is a bear which is betrayed by the peasant; and here we have quite a different and characteristic conclusion, according to which the fox contrives by his cunning that the bear, who wants to take away the man's oxen, shall be bound by him and killed. In Danish, see Thiele, 2. 249, *The Peasant and the Forest*. In French, see Rabelais, 4. chap. 45, 47. See a poem of Rückert's, p. 75, in which the story has been taken from an Arabian source. There is a popular superstition that fruits which grow above ground should be sown in light that is increasing, and those which grow underground in that which is decreasing. In Normandy, even at this day, they tell how St. Michael and the Devil disputed with each other as to which could build the most beautiful church. The Devil built one of stone; Michael put together one more beautiful still made of ice. Afterwards, when this melted, both of them wanted to cultivate the ground; the Devil chose as his own what grew above ground, and Michael retained for himself what was hidden in the earth. Compare *Deutsche Mythologie*, 678, 980, 981.

...

Pantagruel was astonished at this, and on asking what kind of Games they were playing there, he was told that for the last three Years there had raged in the Island a Pestilence so horrible, that the Half or more of the Country had remained desolate, and the Lands without Occupiers. When the Pestilence had gone by, this Man, who was hidden within the Sacristy, was ploughing a large and fertile n Piece of Ground and sowing it with Wheat 12 at the very Day and Hour that a small Devil (one who did not know how to thunder or hail except only on Parsley and Cabbages, and moreover could not yet read or write) had obtained Leave from Lucifer to go for a Holiday and Recreation in this Island of the Popefigs, wherein the Devils were very familiar with the Men and Women, and often went there to pass their Time.

This Devil, having got to the Place, addressed himself to the Labourer, and asked him what he was doing. The poor Man answered him that he was sowing this Field with Wheat, to help him to live the following Year.

"Nay, but this Field is none of thine," said the Devil; "it is mine, and belongs to me; for from the Time that you made the Fig at the Pope, all this Country was adjudged, proscribed and given up to us. To sow Corn, however, is not my Province; wherefore I leave thee the Field, but on condition that we share the Profit."

"I am willing," answered the Labourer.

"I mean," said the Devil, "that we are to make two Lots of the Profit that results. One shall be that which grows above the Earth, the other that which shall be covered by the Earth. The Right of choosing belongs to me, for I am a Devil, born of a noble and ancient Race j thou art but a Clown. I make Choice of that which shall be in the Earth; thou shalt have that which is above. At what Time shall be the In-gathering?"

"About the middle of July," answered the Labourer.

"Very well," said the Devil, "I will not fail to be here; meantime do as is thy Duty to do. Work, Villain, work. I am off to tempt to the gallant Sin of Luxury13 the noble Nuns of Pette-sec,14 also the Cowled Hypocrites and Gluttons. Of their Desires I am more than assured.

CHAPTER XLVI

How the little Devil was beguiled by a Labourer of Popefig-land

WHEN mid- July had come, the Devil presented himself at the Place, accompanied by a Troop of little Devilkins of the Choir.1 There, finding the Labourer, he said: "Now, Villain, how hast thou done since my Departure? It is fitting now that we should make out our Shares."

"It is but Reason," answered the Labourer.

Then the Labourer and his Men began to reap the Corn. The Devilkins likewise pulled up the Stubble from the Earth. The Labourer threshed his Corn on the Threshing-floor,2 winnowed it, put it in Sacks and carried it to Market to sell. The Imps did the same, and set themselves down at the Market-place, near the Labourer, to sell their Stubble. The Labourer sold his Corn very well, and with the Money filled an old Half-buskin, which he carried at his Girdle. The Devils sold nothing, nay, on the contrary, the Peasants jeered at them in open Market.

When the Market was over, the Devil said to the Labourer : "Villain, thou hast cheated me this time; next time thou shalt not do so."

"Master Devil," said the Labourer, "how could I have cheated you, when you had the first Choice? The Truth is, that in this Choice you thought to cheat me, expecting that nothing would come out of the Earth for my Share, and that you would find below the whole of the Grain which I had sown; intending therewith to tempt the Poor and

Gospel."

"Let us leave this Subject," said the Devil; "what canst thou sow our Field with next Year?"

"To make a Profit like a good Husbandman," said the Labourer, "the proper thing would be to sow Turnips."

"Well," said the Devil, "thou art an honest Clown. Sow Turnips in abundance; I will guard them from the Storm, and will not hail upon them. But understand thoroughly; I retain for my Share that which shall be above Ground; thou shalt have all that is below.

"Work, Villain, work. I am off to tempt the Heretics; their Souls are dainty Morsels when broiled on the Coals.4 My Lord Lucifer has the Colic; they will make a Tid-bit for him."

When the time of Gathering was come, the Devil appeared on the Ground with a Squadron of waiting5 Devilkins. There, finding the Labourer and his Men, he began to cut and gather the Leaves of the Turnips. After him the Labourer dug and pulled up the big Turnips, and put them into Sacks. So they all go off together to Market. The Labourer sold his Turnips very well; the Devil sold nothing, and, what was worse, they jeered at him publicly.

"I see very well, Villain," said the Devil, "that I have been cheated by thee. I will make an End of the Business between thee and me. The Bargain shall be that we will clapperclaw one another, and whichever of us two shall first give in shall quit his Share of the Field. That shall be wholly the Property of the Conqueror. Our Meeting shall be adjourned to this day Week. Away, Villain, I will claw thee like the Devil.

There is also a punning breakfast, and to have got the colic allusion to a proverb : from it.

"In fact, Lord Lucifer takes at all his Meals Hobgoblins as his first Course; and he used to breakfast off Students, but, alas ! by some Misfortune, I know not what, they have for some Years past added the Holy Bible to their Studies. For this Reason we cannot draw one of them to the Devil; and I believe that if the Hypocrite Monks do not help us, by taking their St. Paul from their Hands by Threats, Revilings, Force, Violence and Burnings, we shall get no more to nibble at down below.9

CHAPTER XLVII

How the Devil was deceived by an old Woman of Popefig-land

THE Labourer, as he returned Home, was gloomy and pensive. His Wife, seeing him thus, thought he had been robbed at Market; but when she heard the Cause of his Melancholy, and also saw his Purse full of Money, she gave him Comfort sweetly, and assured him that no Harm should come to him from this Scratching-bout; he had only to lie and rely on her; she had already contrived how to bring it to a successful Issue.

"At the worst," said the Labourer, "I shall only get one Scratch x in it; I will yield at the first Stroke, and quit the Field for him."

"Not a bit, not a bit," said the old Woman, "lie and rely upon me; let me deal with him. You have told me he is a little Devil; I will soon make him give up, and the Field shall remain ours. If it had been a great Devil there would have been something to think of."

The Day they had appointed was that on which we came into the Island. Early in the Morning the Labourer had well confessed himself, had communicated like a good Catholic, and by the Advice of the Vicar had dived and hidden in the Sacristy, in the State in which we had found him.

Just as they were telling us this Story, we got News that the old Woman had befooled the Devil and gained the Field.

The Manner of it was as follows. The Devil came to the Labourer's Door, knocked and called out : "So ho Villain, ho Villain; now for a fine Clawing-match."

Then as he came into the House briskly and quite resolute, he did

not find the Labourer there, but spied his Wife lying on the Ground weeping and wailing.

"What's this?" asked the Devil. "Where is he? What is he doing?"

"Ha!" said the old Woman, "where is he, the Wretch, the Butcher, the Murderer? He has done for me.2 I am undone, I am dying of the Hurt he has done me."

"How?" said the Devil; "what is the Matter? I will very soon regale him for you."

"Ha!" said the old Woman, "he told me, the Butcher, the Tyrant, the Devil-tearer that he is, that he had an Appointment to-day for a Scratching-match with you; and just to try his Nails he only scratched me with his little Finger here, between the Legs, and he has quite undone me. I am undone; I shall never be cured; only look. Besides, he is gone to the Blacksmith's to have his Pounces sharpened and pointed. You are undone, Mr. Devil, my Friend. Save yourself; he will be here directly.3 Take yourself off, I beseech you."

With this she uncovered herself up to the Chin, after the manner in which the a Persian Women formerly presented themselves before their » Piut. de virt. Children, as they fled from Battle, and shewed him her What's-its-name.

The Devil, seeing the enormous Solution of Continuity in all its Dimensions, cried out: "Mahoun, Demiourgon,4 Megaera, Alecto, Persephone, he won't find me here; I am off double quick. Sela ! 5 I give up the Field to him."

Having heard the Catastrophe and End of the Story, we retired on board our Ship and made no further Stay there.
