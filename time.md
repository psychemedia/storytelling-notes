# Time notes

Once upon a time, there was too much time.

Because time was *everywhere*.

Everywhere had its own time.

When *there* was near *here*, you didn't really notice the difference, but when *there* was somewhere far off, the time could well be different. Or not. Depending on which way you had to travel to get from *here* to *there*.

When you could only travel at the speed of foot, say, four miles an hour at an even pace, you would be unlikely to travel more that 20 miles in a day. On a good day, a horse powered mail service could travel at double that rate.

### Speed of sound

According to the old lore, when you see the lighning, count out the seconds till you hear the thunder. Each five seconds counts out a mile to the centre of the storm.

If you want to do the sums, the speed of sound in air is 330 m/s. A mile is just over 1600 meters (the 1500m athletics race is the modern mile).

p171

Flashes of lightning frequently extend two or three miles in length; and since the thunder is produced at every point along its course nearly at the same instant, the prolonged rolling noise of thunder arises from the different intervals of time it takes the sound to reach the ear. For since sound travels at the rate of 1118 feet per second, it is first heard from the nearest point of the flash, later and later from points more distant, and the combined effect is a continued peal of thunder. The direction of the peal and its character will depend on the length of the flash, and the greater or less obliquity of its course as regards the observer. Reverberations from clouds and from mountains frequently heighten the effect and prolong the peal. From the rate at which sound travels, if the thunder is not heard till five seconds after the flash, the distance is about a mile. Thunder has not been heard at a greater distance than 14 miles from the flash.

### Speed of the sun over the Earth

To an engineering approximation, the Earth is 24000 miles round at the equator (it's actually just shie of 25,000, but engineers are good at making the sums easy whilst getting the ball park figure right). So with a day lasting 24 hours, the sun appeaars to travel round the world at 1000 miles and hour. Which, to another engineering approximation that favours round numbers, is about 15 miles a minute

More exact:

Distance round equator: 24,901 miles.  
Overland speed: 1037.5 mph, 17.2 mph

BUT: latitude matters (i.e. how far north or south of the equator you are in terms of the ditance round that line of latitude) — think of the distance round a balloon.

For London, the distance is 25000.cos(latitude) ~ 15,500 miles, 645mph, just under 11 miles per minute
For IW, 15,850 miles, 660mph, 11 miles per per minute
For Leeds / Manchester, 14,800 miles, 620 mph, 10.3 (a little bit over 10) miles per minute
For Edinburgh, just under 140000 miles, 580 mph, 9.7 (a little bit under 10 miles) per minute.

So how can time travel more quickly on the Island than it does in London, yet the Island still be behind the times in the metoropolis?

Also, as an aside: given that the Earth is about 25,000 miles round (the engineering approaximation to a nice round number), suppose that you have a rope tied around the equator, at ground level. And you want to somehow lift that rope up so that is is just 1 foot about the ground. What length of rope would you need to add to make that possible? [6 feet: 2 pi (R+1)]

Solar time (relative to sun high point), 24 hours in a day

Sidereal time (relative to stars), 23 hours 56 mins 4 seconds; over a year, 4 mins* 365 days is just over 1500 minutes, or 24 hours. In a year, the Earch gets back to its starting position compared to the stars.


### Sound and sun

In Britain, the sound of church bells is a bit faster than the speed of the sun.

Henry Booth - elements of "Uniformity of Time considered especially in reference to Railways and the Electric Telegraph" pamphlet, 1847 in https://ia802608.us.archive.org/20/items/memoirlatehenry00smilgoog/memoirlatehenry00smilgoog.pdf Memoir of the Late Henry Booth, of the Liverpool and Manchester, and Afterwards of the London ...
by Robert Smiles
Publication date 1869

pp. 63-4

The amalgamation of the great companies which formed the London and North-Western, Mr. Booth's official connection with that company, the extension of the railway system in all directions, and the close connection thus established among places formerly at long distances from each other in point of time forced upon Mr. Booth's attention an important question of special concernment to railway companies and to the community at large. Soon after the consolidation of the London and North-Western, Mr. Booth, ever prompt and persevering, commenced an attack upon the inconvenient anomaly, the positive annoyance, and palpable absurdity of "a thousand and one" places in the United Kingdom, having each a time of its own, and each different from all the others. Mr. Booth's clever brochure  — a letter to the Eight Hon. Edward Strutt, M.P., chairman of the Railway Commissioners, upon "Uniformity of Time," considered especially in reference to railway transit and the operations of the electric telegraph, was one of the most sprightly of his productions, and tempts strongly to quotation. The inconvenience and absurdity inseparable from recognition of "local time;" the utter impossibility of conducting railway traffic, according either to "Bradshaw," or to a Roskell's best chronometer, with any approach to regularity or precision, are cleverly displayed. The demand of the appeal is legal recognition and acknowledgment of only one time throughout the kingdom. Inasmuch as some of Mr. Booth's pictures and descriptions are interesting contributions to history, we venture to transcribe them.

Speaking of things as they were, he gives this description, when the clock strikes, say twelve, either noon or night:—

"The parish clocks in some half a dozen hamlets or fishing-towns in the extreme east, in quick succession, commence the long and dissonant peal; Norwich and Yarmouth, Harwich and Ramsgate, with a hundred clocks and chimes ring vigorously; Canterbury, Colchester, and Cambridge prolong the *feu de joie*; with a thousand intermediate towns and villages, each with its market-clock or market-bell proclaiming *its own time*; each in succession, but all without intermission, multitudinous in voice and key — major and minor, tenor and counter-tenor, treble, and something more, ringing and mingling their notes unmusical. Westward the noise moves on till it gains the suburbs of the huge metropolis; Poplar and Limehouse, Stepney and Bethnal Green, each with its clock and bells, with iron tongues and clappers, still in succession, uninterruptedly, unintermittingly, jar gratingly; while, as the moving din reaches St. Martin's-le-Grand, the great bell of St. Paul's tolls with mourning voice in grave rebuke of the passing clamour. And still the din proceeds; still in its westward course — Brentford and Windsor, Reading and Oxford, Southampton and Salisbury, onward for a mortal hour, 'by Shrewsbury clock;' while every city, town, or township, hamlet, or 'extra-parochial place,' as the incessant roar sweeps over its head, marking its particular time, calls out— 'That's my thunder!'"

To the generation of to-day, accustomed to "Greenwich time," from John o' Groat's House to the Land's End, it seems almost incredible that little more than twenty years ago the following ludicrous scene so racily depicted by Mr. Booth might have been an actual occurrence. He entreats the Post-office authorities, or the Legislature, to exercise commiseration towards their agents in the provinces, on whom devolves the task of adjusting local to London time:—

"Imagine the anxiety of the post-mistress at the village of B, in the far west, when she receives a new scheme of departures of the mail from the county town, twenty-three miles east by north of her own village — the new mail to start from the said county town at llh. 44m. a.m., London time — speed, including stoppages, 9 miles an hour — the problem to be solved being, at what hour, local time, the proposed mail so starting from the county town will arrive at the said village of B———. 

"The post-mistress, on receipt of the order, hastens to the schoolmaster of the place, and, having explained her dilemma, 'Madam,' he replies, with the gravity becoming one consulted in a difficulty, 'the question you have proposed to me — at what time will the mail arrive at the Post-office at B, involves one of our most abstruse problems in mathematics. It were a simple matter, if the solution depended alone on the difference of longitude east or west of Grreenwich; but the obliquity of the earth's axis, and more especially the elliptic figure of the earth's orbit, — these disturbing causes. Madam, you are aware (the lady was not at all aware) produce no little complexity in the computation by which we would arrive at the desired solution. Not six days in the year do the sun and clock keep even and equable time: my calculation, therefore, will be correct for the 21st of the present month, when the new mail starts, but for no other day in this year of our Lord; but the differences being small, as the earth moves through the vast ellipse, you will easily make those allowances which the season requires. I will immediately consult my Ephemeris , and in three days I trust I shall be able to tell you, within a few seconds, at what time, on the 21st instant, the mail ought, my dear madam — ought, I say emphatically — to arrive at the village of B."

"Having thus oracularly delivered himself, the learned man retires to his study to consult his Ephemeris, and prosecute his three days' labour; and the post-mistress returns to her duties more fully impressed than before with the dignity of her office as post-mistress of the place, thankful that she had a friend in need, and quite convinced that the venerable sage with whom she had just conferred was the lineal descendant of him of whom the poet said: —

And still the wonder grew,  
That one small head could carry all he knew.

Mr. Booth gives equally graphic illustrations of the absurdities involved by the "local time," or the regulation of time by longitude or by the sun's course as applied to railway traffic. As a remedy for the anomaly and inconvenience, he asks that public clocks and pocket timepieces throughout the kingdom should be regulated to one common time.

That at one and the same moment, whether in London or Edinburgh, at Canterbury or Cardiff, the labourer may return to his toil or to his hour of rest, the man of business keep his appointment, and the traveller regulate his movements with the con-fidence of one who has no longer the fear of the 'longitude' before his eyes. There is sublimity in the idea of a whole nation stirred by one impulse; in every arrangement one common signal regulating the movements of a mighty people!"

In this important matter Mr. Booth attained the object of his desire — the evil was exterminated, and he had the satisfaction that Parliament did not as he conjured it not to do, 'wait the miserable alternative, the euthanasia of a worn-out abuse!'"

Denying time to others

[The Building of the present Town Hall, Chester https://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archiveDS/archiveDownload?t=arch-2910-1/dissemination/pdf/JCAS_ns_047/JCAS_ns_047_021-032.pdf]

In the city of Chester, situated just a mile or so from English border with Wales, the west facing, Welsh facing side of the clock tower on the town hall remains blank: local legend has it that the citizens of Chester would not even give the Welsh the time of day.

The design for the building was established via competition running from 1862 to 1864. The planning even for that seems to have indicated that project management was not a strong point:

The lack of timesharing is relatively recent, however: the clock itself was only installed in 1979, 110 years after the town hall itself was completed. In a masterly oversight of budget planning, the cost of winding the clock for an hour day, every day, on top of the cost itself was too much for the original organising Council Committee to bear.

From my telling of Jamie Macpherson / macpherson's Lament: "The violin, well, the violin, and Jamie's huge sword, I believe they can still be seen, to this day, in a small museum in Banff, in North-East Scotland. And in that town of Banff, from where Jamie was hung, well, the lairdship was stripped of its manorial right of managing trial and punishment. And in the town of Macduff, just over the estuary, I have heard said the facing wall of the clock tower there is blanked off; for the people of Macduff have not given the people of Banff, the time of day ever since that fateful day of November 16th, 1700, when Jamie Macpherson played his final lament."

[Action of ejectment: https://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Action+of+ejectment] "Originally the ownership of land in England could be passed to another only by delivering the actual possession of the land. The present owner passed title to another by picking up a clod of dirt on the land and handing it to the other person in front of others from the community. This ceremonial act from ancient times was called Livery of Seisin, or delivery of possession. Instead of a clod, a twig or a key could be handed over as a symbol of ownership, but only later was it permissible to deliver the symbol of ownership anywhere but on the land itself. As time passed and writing became more common, a written deed could symbolize the delivery of ownership. The purpose of the ceremony was to make the acquiring of land a public act generally known in the community, so that disputes were less likely to arise."

The action of ejectment branched off from this as another action for the relief of one whose possession had been disturbed. By it, the plaintiff might claim that he or she had been in possession of a certain parcel of land and that the land had been taken by the defendant. The plaintiff could do this by obtaining from the clerk of the court a writ of entry—a command from the king telling the defendant to let the plaintiff go back on the land taken by the defendant or to appear in court to answer the charge. The defendant could then appear and deny that the plaintiff had been dispossessed or show that as the defendant, he or she had a prior and better right to hold the land. A trial was held to settle the issue. If it were found that the defendant had wrongfully withheld possession of the property from the plaintiff, he or she could be made to pay an amercement, or fine. This fine became a precedent for the later practice of awarding money damages to the successful plaintiff in addition to restoring possession of the land.

Originally, the action of ejectment was intended to protect the rights of a tenant who leased the land. Ultimately, it came to be the principal method for determining the ownership of real property. When the question of title to land became the issue, it was essential to describe the property as carefully as it would be described in a deed to a purchaser. This led to enforcement of very strict technicalities by the court, and the action of ejectment became less attractive to plaintiffs because of the chance that the case would be lost on a point of procedure.

[Livery of Seisin https://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Livery+of+Seisin / https://law.jrank.org/pages/8328/Livery-Seisin.html Livery of seisin was the dominant method of transferring land in England until 1536, and it continued to be legal until 1925. The term livery of seisin means simply "transfer of possession": livery means "delivery" and is from the Old French livrer, and seisin means "possession" and is from the Old French saisir or seisir. The concept behind livery of seisin, therefore, was the symbolic transfer of the possession of land. The entire ceremony of transfer was called feoffment with livery of seisin, with feoffment meaning "a gift," specifically a gift of a freehold interest in a parcel of land. The transferor was the feoffor, the transferee was the feoffee, and the land interest was the fief.

In the Middle Ages, a livery of seisin was essential to convey land from one party to another; without it no real right to land could be transferred. When performing the ceremony, the feoffor, the feoffee, and their witnesses generally stood on the land itself, though it was permissible to stand within view of the land if the feoffee made an actual entry to the land while the feoffor was still alive. During the ceremony the feoffor spoke appropriate words declaring the gift, and then handed the feoffee an object representing that gift, such as dirt, turf, or a twig, or even a ring, a cross, or a knife. If a house was being transferred, the ring of the door might be exchanged.

In addition to delivering possession of the land, the feoffor needed to vacate the land. The feoffor's tenants and others living on the land were expelled, along with their possessions. In some cases, the feoffor performed a ceremony or gesture showing Abandonment of the land, such as by making a sign with the hands, jumping over a hedge, or throwing a rod to the feoffee.]

The Real Property Act of 1845 (8 & 9 Vict. ch. 106 [Eng.]) did not abolish livery of seisin, but it did allow deeds to be used freely as granting devices, which had the same effect. The Law of Property Act, passed in 1925 (15 & 16 Geo. 5, ch. 20 [Eng.]), finally abolished the livery-of seisin ceremony.

Back in the day, every place had its own time. Not just its own local village fete, its own market day or County Assizes, but its own time.

When it was midday in Oxford it was just after five *past* twelve in London (or 5 minutes and two seconds passed twelve to be precise). At the same time, it was five minutes *to* twelve in Bristol.

Time followed the sun.

So when people said "London is ahead of the times", that was true, in a certain sense: daylight gets there before many places in the UK. And if people say, "the folk in the West Country are so behind the times", that's could also be true...

Every evening at 9 o'clock "Oxford Time" (which is to say five *past* nine in London time), the bell at Christ Church College, Great Tom, rings out a hundred and one times, once for each of the college's original 101 students, calling the colleges to lock their gates. Thereupon, it remains silent until it resumes announcing the London hour, every hour from 8am the next morning. To this day the people of Oxford know their own time.

As they do in Bristol. If you're ever on the Big Island, and happen to visit Bristol, and if you find yourself stood in from of the old Corn Exchange, look up to the clock tower: as well as the rather unusual red painted numbers, you'll notice it has *two* minute hands. The red minute hand shows London time, Greenwich Mean Time; but a *second*, __black__ minute hand shows local Bristol time, 10 minutes behind.

Having your own time could lead to problems. In 1858, at the Dorchester Assizes, a hearing was set for 10 o'clock a.m. The case involved an action of ejectment, which is to say a property case. In those days, ownership of land could be transferred by ritual and custom as much as it was by legal document.

The medieval *livery of seisin*, which remained as valid in law until 1925, fewer than a hundred years ago, when my own grandparents were children, required the original landowner and whoever was being given the land, along with any witnesses to gather somewhere on the land; the owner would then pick up a handful of earth and hand it over, literally handing of the ownership of it.

If there was a land dispute, an "action of ejectment" could be brought by someone who argued that they had wrongfully been dispossessed of the land or had a better right to it.

*I don't know if the particular case involved the livery of seisin, but it makes for a more colourful story if it does!*

And so it was that on November 25th, at 10 am, the case of Curtis versus March, in the matter of an action of ejectment, was called.

"The plaintiff's counsel commenced his address to the jury, but as the defendant was not present and no one appeared for him, the learned Judge directed a verdict for the plaintiff. The defendant's counsel then entered the Court and claimed to have the cause tried, on the ground that it had been disposed of before 10 o'clock."

The Judge looked to the clock in the court, and it showed the time a little after 10. The defence had *not* been in court at the appointed time, had not been there to provide a defence, and so, because there was no defence, the case had gone against them.

The defence counsel perhaps coughed, and spluttered, pointing to the town clock that could be seen through the window of the court: it was still one and a half minutes *to* 10 o'clock.

If you look at where Dorchester is on a map of England, you find it just above, and to the right of Weymouth; if you look further up the map, higher in latitude but at the same *longitude*, you'll see it's just slightly to the right of Bristol...

...and as such, almost 10 minutes behind London time.

In Dorchester, the town clock was running on local time; the court clock was set to Greenwich mean time, to London time. The defence council, checking the time by the town clock, had arrived, or so he thought, in good time.

The case was taken to appeal in the Court of Exchequer, in London, also known as The Exchequer of Pleas, who considered the matter and made their decision: "[w]hen it is stated that a court will sit at a particular hour, that is understood by all persons as the time at the place where the court sits. We are as much bound to take judicial notice that a particular place lies east or west of Greenwich, and consequently has a different time from it, as we are to know the days of the year". 

The Exchequer of Pleas ruled in favour of the defendant, allowing them to have "an opportunity of trying the cause".

"A person hearing that the court would sit at 10 o'clock would naturally understand that to mean 10 o'clock by the time of the place , unless the contrary was expressed . In this case, looking to the difference of time (of which we are bound to take judicial notice), the defendant was in court before 10 o'clock."

If the trial is set in Dorchester, to be on Thursday at 10 in Dorchester, then the case will be heard, on Thursday, at 10, in Dorchester, using the local time of that place.


Such is the way of the law in Britain and Ireland, a *Common Law* approach, where judges rulings in the absence of statute, or interpretation of enacted laws and statutes, are the law, Curtis versus March defined "standard time" as used in the courts of Great Britain and Ireland.

Standard time as London time, as Greenwich mean time, GMT, did not enter the statute book until 1880, and the reign of Queen Victoria, in an August 1880 "Act to remove doubts as to the meaning of Expressions relative to Time occurring in Acts of Parliament, deeds, and other legal instruments".

> WHEREAS it is expedient to remove certain doubts as to whether expressions of time occurring in Acts of Parliament, deeds, and other legal instruments relate in England and Scotland to Greenwich time, and in Ireland to Dublin time, or to the mean astronomical time in each locality:
> 
> Be it therefore enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows; (that is to say,)
> 
> 1. Whenever any expression of time occurs in any Act of Parliament, deed, or other legal instrument, the time referred shall, unless it is otherwise specifically stated, be held in the case of Great Britain to be Greenwich mean time, and in the case of Ireland, Dublin mean time.
> 2. This Act may be cited as the Statutes (Definition of Time) Act, 1880.

'4. Time is a local phenomenon. An interesting discussion of this occurred in Curtis v. March (1858) 3 H &N 866 (157 ER 719). Watson B had taken his seat on the bench at Dorchester punctually at ten by the clock in the Court, and the cause being called on and the defendant not appearing had directed a verdict for the plaintiff. Later, counsel appeared and claimed that the Court had sat before the appointed hour; for the Court clock recorded Greenwich time and the town clock Dorchester time, which was some minutes later.

On appeal a new trial was directed because the time of the place should prevail. "We are as much bound", said Pollock CB, "to take judicial notice that a particular place lies east or west of Greenwich, and consequently has a different time from it, as we are to know the days of the year" (1858) 3 H&N, at p 867 (157 ER, at p 719).

plaintiff versus defendant

CURTIS v . MARCH . Nov. 25 , 1858

*The time appointed for the sitting of a Court must be understood as the mean time at the place where the Court sits, and not Greenwich time, unless it be so expressed.*

This was an action of ejectment which was entered for trial before Watson , B., at the last Dorchester Assizes. The time appointed for the sitting of the Court was 10 o'clock A. M., and the learned Judge took his seat on the bench punctually at 10 by the clock in Court. The cause was then called on , and the plaintiff's counsel commenced his address to the jury, but as the defendant was not present and no one appeared for him, the learned Judge directed a verdict for the plaintiff. The defendant's counsel then entered the Court and claimed to have the cause tried, on the ground that it had been disposed of before 10 o'clock.

At that time it wanted one minute and a half to 10 by the town clock. The clock in Court was regulated by Greenwich time, which was some minutes before the true time at Dorchester. The learned Judge having refused the application, *Cole* had obtained a rule nisi for a new trial upon affidavits of the above facts, against which *Slade* and *Kingdon* showed cause . — The sitting of the court was properly regulated by Greenwich time.

[ POLLOCK, C. B. - When it is stated that a court will sit at a particular hour, that is understood by all persons as the time at the place where the court sits. We are as much bound to take judicial notice that a particular place lies east or west of Greenwich , and consequently has a different time from it, as we are to know the days of the year. ] A judge may appoint the sittings of the court by Greenwich time.

[POLLOCK, C. B.- No doubt; but that was not done in this case. Suppose a question arises as to whether a person died at 12 o'clock on a particular day, is that to be determined by the time of the place or Greenwich time? ] The time to be observed at any place is determined by a resolution of the authorities or general course of the parties at that place. Greenwich time is observed at most places in England through which railways pass, and in some the clocks have two sets of hands, the one showing Greenwich time the other the time of the place.

H. T. Cole appeared to support the rule, but was not called upon .

POLLOCK , C. B .--We are all of opinion that the defendant ought to have an opportunity of trying the cause. The rule will therefore be absolute without costs. It seems to me doubtful whether this application is in consequence of mistake on the part of the defendant or his counsel, for it may be that the Dorchester town clock pointed to Dorchester time, although that in court was regulated by Greenwich time, and that this circumstance was not generally known in Dorchester. I cannot assent to the argument that the town council of any place may by their resolution declare that Greenwich , or any other time, shall be the time of the place; for I cannot help seeing the consequences. The difference between Greenwich time and the real time at Carlisle is several minutes, and therefore if a town council might determine the time, they might make a man born on a different day from that on which he was really born . Or suppose that by act of parliament a person was bound to go out of office on a particular day, the town council by altering the time might put him out of office to-day instead of to-morrow . So, if a person is entitled to a bonus from an insurance office in the event of his living to a certain period , that must be decided , not by the town council adopting Greenwich time, but by the mean time of the place. Ten o'clock is 10 o'clock according to the time of the place, and the town council cannot say that it is not, but that it is 10 o'clock by Greenwich time. Neither can the time be altered by a rail way company whose railway passes through the place, nor by any person who regulates the clock in the town-hall. A person hearing that the court would sit at 10 o'clock would naturally understand that to mean 10 o'clock by the time of the place , unless the contrary was expressed . In this case, looking to the difference of time (of which we are bound to take judicial notice), the defendant was in court before 10 o'clock .

Watson, B. — On the day when the cause was tried, I came into court punctually at 10 by the clock in the judges' room , which was set at Greenwich time. I proceeded at once with the business. A few * 69]minutes afterwards Mr. Cole came in and stated that it was not yet 10, but I did not hear whether he meant by the mean time of the place or by Greenwich time. That is now explained by the affidavits, from which it appears that two times are kept, the clock in the court being regulated by Greenwich time.

CHANNELL, B., concurred . Rule absolute.

[2nd August 1880.]

WHEREAS it is expedient to remove certain doubts as to whether expressions of time occurring in Acts of Parliament, deeds, and other legal instruments relate in England and Scotland to Greenwich time, and in Ireland to Dublin time, or to the mean astronomical time in each locality:

Be it therefore enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows; (that is to say,)

[Meaning of expressions relating to time.]
1. Whenever any expression of time occurs in any Act of Parliament, deed, or other legal instrument, the time referred shall, unless it is otherwise specifically stated, be held in the case of Great Britain to be Greenwich mean time, and in the case of Ireland, Dublin mean time.
[Short title.]
2. This Act may be cited as the Statutes (Definition of Time) Act, 1880.




https://mylesdungan.com/tag/curtis-v-march/: "The prominence of local time—i.e. the actual time at a specific location, rather than a centralised version of same—came about in the United Kingdom in 1858. At that time we were members of the august configuration of stroppy nations. On 25 November of that year the defendant in Curtis v March, due to be heard by a judge in Dorchester failed to show up for his hearing and lost his case. He appealed on the basis that he'd been told to be in court at 10.00 am and had turned up on time, according to the local time on the town clock, but not in line with GMT. He won his appeal and that ruling defined 'time' in the UK as local, until the 1880 legislation which standardised it in Britain and left us twenty-five minutes adrift."

## How Time Flies

Although my daughter lives away from us now, we try to meet up with her several times a year: Christmas and New Year, Easter, and around her birthday in February. Visiting her one year, I met one of her friends who was telling everyone she could this rather strange thing: *the day before yesterday I was twenty one, next year I'll be twenty four*. How could this be so?

By the 1840's there were at least three organisations which suffered inconveniences because of the use of local times - the railways, the telegraph companies, and the Post Office.

In June 1836, John Henry Belville, who was employed at the Greenwich Observatory in London, started making a weekly visit to the principal chronometer makers in London, he took a pocket chronometer with him, set to Greenwich time.

In November 1840, the Great Western Railway ordered that London time should be used in all its timetables, and at all its stations.

In 1845 the Liverpool and Manchester Railway company unsuccessfully petitioned Parliament, to ask that a single uniform time be used for all ordinary and commercial purposes.

In January 1846, the North Western Railway introduced London time, to their station at Liverpool and Manchester.

On 22nd September 1847, the Railway Clearing House recommended that every railway company in Britain adopt Greenwich time at their stations, as soon as possible.

In 1st December 1847, the London and North Western, and the Caledonian Railway both adopted London time.

Bradshaws Railway Guide for January 1848 list the London and south western, London and North western, Midland, Chester and Birkenhead, Lancaster and Carlisle, East Lancashire and the York and North Midland railways as all keeping Greenwich time.

In November 1840 GWR announced that a standardised time – railway time as it was called - would be observed at all their stations. Several other railway companies followed suit and on 22 September 1847 the Railway Clearing House decided that GMT should be adopted as the standard time on all railway stations across the country.

...
Alaturka Saat and the Spread of Mean Time

The Ottoman hour system traced its origins to the ancient scheme of"seasonal" or "temporal" hours, according to which the day and the night were eachdivided into a set of twelve equal units. Daytime hours were counted from sunrise to sunset and night time hours, from sunset to sunrise. As the length of daytime and night time changed throughout the year, the seasonal hours varied in length accordingly.

According to the system devised by Ottoman astronomers in the fifteenth century, if not earlier, two cycles of twelve equal hours were counted from sunset, reckoned as twelve o'clock palace circles.

6 It seems safe to assume that by the second half of the eighteenth century, thousands of timepieces were marketed throughout the Ottoman domains every year.

7 Seasonal hours were ill suited for the new devices, as their length equaled the standard hours of the clock only on the two equinoxes. Equinoctial hours, by contrast, were fully compatible with the uniform hours of the mechanical clock except that the need to adjust all clocks and watches to show 12 at sunset wore down their mechanisms.

8 Since sunset (gurub) was the baseline of this unique Ottoman arrangement, just as it was in the system of seasonal hours, the names gurubi (and ezani) saat remained in use and were in fact at least as common inofficial correspondence as the now better-known term alaturka saat. For the sake of clarity, however, I will use this last term throughout this study and elaborate on the cultural and political meanings it carried in the second half of the article.

9 In order to evaluate correctly the alaturka system, we need to re-place it in the "temporal culture" from which it emerged. The term "temporal culture" here denotes the vast ensemble of practices, behaviors, and concepts that concern the social organization of time and fill it with meaning. In contrast to modern,artificially lit societies, in the temporal culture of early modern Ottoman society sunset brought an end to the daily cycle of social life, as people withdrew from the public sphere into the safety of their homes. Moreover, sunset marked the beginning of a new calendar day and the beginning of a new cycle of religious ritual.

It thus made perfect sense to set the clock to start a new cycle at this time, with the call fo

 Greenwich, time and 'the line'
 On why the prime meridian is where it is...
 ...
 There is a standard account of the genesis of the Prime Meridian in Greenwich. Although Britain had taken the meridian (north
–
south line of longitude) to which the Greenwich transit instrument was aligned as a reference point for navigational data, charts and maps since the 18th century and for most timekeeping purposes since the mid-19th century, guidebooks and websites explain that it became an international standard in 1884. This was the result of an international conference held in Washington,D.C. at which delegates from 25 countries were asked to settle on a common initial meridian from which to measure time and longitude. They voted overwhelmingly in favour of the Greenwich meridian

For Great Britain, where the Greenwich meridian was already taken as the initial, or prime, meridian for most mapping and timekeeping purposes, the Washington recommendations would have far less impact on either ordinary or official life than elsewhere. Yet the government did nothing to make them law and the only immediate result of the conference was that William Christie, the Astronomer Royal, changed the hands of the 24-h public clock outside the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, on 1January1885(Fig.1).This was in accordance with another of the Washington recommendations: that the astronomical day, traditionally reckoned from midday, should conform to the civil day, beginning at midnight
 ...
 Instead, popular periodicals, from Nature to Punch, suggest that attention and anxiety focused on the replacement of a.m. and p.m. witha 24-h notation. The chief topics for discussion appear to have been the design of clocks and watch dials and the question of whether public clocks should strike 13
–
24 times after midday. Articles and letters from late 1884 and early 1885 suggest a perception that the Washington resolutions were binding and that the 'new reckoning' of time came into force on 1 January 1885, as symbolised by Christie's action
...

here were suggestions that watchmakers were encouraging the notion that not just new dials but new 24-h movements would be required.
7
Even
 Nature
, although aware that the 24-h notation was likely only to be used by railway and telegraph companies at present, thought it ''proper
 . . .
 to consider in what way ordinary watches and clocks could be best accommodated to such a change in the reckoning''.
8
Their suggestions about 24-h movements or double dials and, especially, the raising of the issue of how many times a public clock might strike at night caused a ﬂurry of correspondence with some even more tortuously complicated suggestions as well as dismissive rejections of any such measures
 ...
[This focus on clock dials was partly related to knowledge of the 24-hour public clock at Greenwich but also the various suggestions put forward by Sandford Fleming,the great champion of Universal Time, which included dials with both 24 numbers in Roman numerals and 24 letters of the alphabet, ]

Some Oddities of the Law on Age: So You Thought You Reached Age 21 on Your 21st Birthday?

David Pollard*

> The common law seems to have taken this principle to a logical extreme when dealing with reaching (or attaining) a particular age. Clearly a person is in their first year until they reach the day of their first birthday. Ignoring parts of the day, this means that they complete their first year (and so become treated as age one) at the end of the day just before their first birthday.
> 
> So far so good, but the common law seems to then have treated this as meaning that the person completed their first year at the end of the day before their birthday and so, ignoring part of a day, actually became aged one at the beginning of the day before. And so on for other ages.
> ...
> '6. It is difficult to avoid confusion of thought in this by-way of the law, for the settled rule as to when full age is attained was itself born in confusion. When, in the 17th century, judges came to think that on the day before a person's twenty-first birthday he should be held to be of full age, the general principle as to the indivisibility of a day was treated as providing a logical foundation for the conclusion.
>
> 'In truth it did not provide a foundation for the conclusion at all. It did justify treating the whole day of the birth as a day of life, so that twenty-one years might logically be considered complete at the end of the day before the twenty-first anniversary of the birth. But it was in the next step that fallacy seems to have intruded. The end of the day before the anniversary was taken to be a part of the day, so that the twenty-one years were held to end on the day, and hence (on the principle of the indivisibility of a day) at the beginning of the day

```
Captain Shurey who had sadly died (of wounds received in action) on the day before his 25th birthday (he was born on 22 July 1891 and died on 21 July 1916). His father's will had left assets to such of his sons as 'shall attain the age of 25 years'. So the issue arose as to whether Captain Shurey met the condition. Sargant J (in an unreserved judgment) held that he had. Sargant J followed several earlier cases 11 and held that:

'a person attains the age of twenty-one years, or of twenty-five years, or any specified age, on the day preceding the anniversary of his twenty-first or twenty-fifth birthday, or other birthday, as the case may be.'

Trust Law International, Vol. 34, No. 1, 2020, 25 Sargant J noted that the 'popular sense' of the words might indicate that you had to reach the actual anniversary date, but he held that: 'There is nothing to show that in this will the testator was not using the words in their legal sense'.

He noted that legislation had seemingly recognised this 'slight legal anomaly' by enacting in the National Insurance Act 1911 in s 79 an express provision:

'that, for the purposes of the part of that Act in which the section is placed, a person shall be deemed to have attained the age of seventeen years, not on the day preceding the anniversary of his birth, but on the actual seventeenth anniversary of the day of his birth.'

...

before 1969 some of the legislation expressly removed the common law rule. National Insurance Act 1911, s 79 stated:

'A person shall be deemed according to the law in England, Wales, and Ireland, as well as according to the law in Scotland, not to have attained the age of seventeen until the commencement of the seventeenth anniversary of the day of his birth, and similarly with respect to other ages.'

```

```{admonition} Family Law Reform Act, 1969

Section 9 states:
'9 Time at which a person attains a particular age  
(1) The time at which a person attains a particular age expressed in years shall be the commencement of the relevant anniversary of the date of his birth.  
(2) This section applies only where the relevant anniversary falls on a date after that on which this section comes into force, and, in relation to any enactment, deed, will or other instrument, has effect subject to any provision therein.
```

> It seems best to consider that someone born on 29 February only reaches a further year of age on 1 March and not 28 February in a non-leap year.1


```
Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) now applies throughout the UK by statute (save to the extent that British Summer Time applies): see the Interpretation Act 1978.19 Section 9 states: '9 References to time of day: Subject to section 3 of the Summer Time Act 1972 (construction of references to points of time during the period of summer time), whenever an expression of time occurs in an Act, the time referred to shall, unless it is otherwise specifically stated, be held to be Greenwich mean time.'

This section is apparently derived from the Statutes (Definition of Time) Act 1880, s 1.

The Summer Time Act 1972, s 3(1), as amended, provides that: 'Wherever any reference to a point of time occurs in any enactment, Order in Council, order, regulation, rule, byelaw, deed, notice or other document whatsoever, the time referred to shall, during the period of summer time, be taken to be the time fixed for general purposes by 'the Summer Time Act 1972'.

However, nothing in the Summer Time Act 1972 affects the use of Greenwich Mean Time for the purposes of astronomy, meteorology or navigation, or affects the construction of any document mentioning or referring to a point of time in connection with any of those purposes: s 3(2). So pension schemes seem likely to need to use Summer Time and probably not GMT even if (I suggest) the scheme relates to astronomers, weather persons or navigators.

What happens if an Act of Parliament relates to actions outside the UK? In R v Logan, 22 British soldiers stationed in Hong Kong were convicted of assault that happened at about 2.30am on 1 January 1957. They were convicted under a UK Act, the Army Act 1955, which only came into force on 1 January 1957. They appealed on the basis that the relevant UK Act had not, at the time of the offence, yet come into force in Hong Kong (being eight hours ahead of GMT)

...
This defence was dismissed. Lord Goddard held:
'If an Act is said to come into force on January 1, it comes into force on the day which is January 1 in the particular place where the Act has to be applied. I can well understand that if an offence were committed in the Western Atlantic the Act might not be in force there on the same day as it would in London because the date might still be December 31 there, but the fact that it became January 1 in Hong Kong a few hours before the clock would actually show January 1 in England does not make any difference. As the Act comes into force on January 1, 1957, in Hong Kong, it comes into force on the day which is January 1 in Hong Kong. Therefore, this point fails and the appeal is dismissed.

```

```

So that the date and time of an event or of an act are ordinarily the date and time determined by the calendar and clock at the place where the event happens or act is done, notwithstanding that the actual occurrence is at different times in different parts of the world.

When effluxion of time has to be considered, a somewhat similar result occurs. Suppose twins born at Greenwich on the same day; the elder, born just before his brother, remains in England; the younger comes to Sydney, and immediately on coming of age speaks by telephone to his elder brother in England. He is an adult, his brother is still an infant. Yet the duration of their infancy is computed from the same moment, namely the beginning of the day they were born.

Some interesting situations can be imagined on this basis with results even more striking than the experience of Phileas Fogg. It seems, however, that any question of personal rights, capacities, disabilities, or qualifications gained or lost by the lapse of a given period of time must be determined according to the clock and the calendar at the place where the person in question is. This matter is not directly relevant here; but it illustrates that concepts concerning the expiry of a given period of time, are elusive and in a sense artificial; and the legal problems they create must be determined by the application of rules of law

If this is followed in the UK (and there seems no reason not to), this would fix the time of reaching a particular age by the relevant time (presumably the official time) in the jurisdiction in which the person actually is at that time (even if they were usually resident elsewhere).

The International Date Line
and Related Issues

When all the people in the world lived in the same area, this
was not an issue. Everybody lived in one region and it was 2:35 PM
on Thursday for everybody simultaneously. When people began to
wander to other lands, those who wandered east were always ahead
of the ones who stayed home. Similarly, those who wandered west
were always behind those who stayed home. Theoretically, if the
east nomads met up with the west nomads, there would be a
problem, because the east nomads kept track of the days ahead of
the original settlement, and the west nomads kept track of the days
behind. Thus, when they met, they would be one day apart.
An arbitrary date line is unacceptable for Jews, though,
because we must keep accurate count of the days, since many
halachot depend on the day of the week - most significantly,
Shabbat. We cannot simply agree to treat tomorrow as Shabbat, on
our own whim!
...
When an airplane flies west, it travels in the same direction as
the sun, so the time will not advance significantly throughout the
flight. If so, one who flies west on the morning of a fast day should
theoretically not be allowed to eat until the fast is over, which is
some time after sunset. His fast would then be much longer than
everyone else's, because he began his fast in the morning of his
departure place, but ended it at night in his destination place.

https://www.networkrail.co.uk/stories/180-years-of-railway-time/
 November 1840, The Great Western Railway – on Isambard Kingdom Brunel's line from London to South West England – told all stations to use London time.

According to the Science Museum, an 1841 timetable for the GWR line from London to Bridgewater said: "LONDON TIME is kept at all the Stations on the Railway, which is about 4 minutes earlier than READING time; 5½ minutes before STEVENTON time; 7½ minutes before CIRENCESTER time; 8 minutes before CHIPPENHAM time; 11 minutes before BATH and BRISTOL time; and 14 minutes before BRIDGEWATER time."

The British Standardisation of Time

"sun dial does not tell time with the same regularity that we are used to today from modern clocs.Gatty elaborates on this in her
 Book of Sun-Dials:

8These twelve parts, however, would always differ in length according to the season, except at the equinox, because the ancients always reckoned their day from sunrise to sunset: Gatty, 1872, p 671

After the mechanical clock was invented, a sundial would still be needed to adjust the clock at noon each day as the early mechanical clockworks were accurate only for a limited period of time ;4Malley, %007, p 61

+ven though the formal standardisation of time occurred a hundred years later, one could say the transition started in the late eighteen century when the idea of Mean Time began to winground. Mean Time is a mathematical solution developed to solve mechanical problems identified by clock makers. Different from sundial time in its regularity, Mean Time divides the day in totwelve, equally long hours. In ??erubavel4s informative study *The Standardization of Time: A Socio-historical Perspective*, we learn how 8=loc time as we know it today, did not come into being until %&5(, when Geneva first started to use "mean time" in preference to solar time8 %056, p 71. Mean time allowed a standard view of how to tell time, however, the conception of time was still a local matter

Local time is the term used to describe the use of local timekeeping. +Een though a used clock show mean time, it still had to be set at noon each day, which gives unique time on each possible location. As a result of the flexion of the Earth, time differs four minutes every degree of longitude, which gives a 6 minutes of time difference across Britain /chivelbusch, %0&&, p @(1

 "number of companies operated the British railways and they all used their own timetables which were often based on the local time where the company4s office was located. ??erubavel identified how 8much inconvenience was involved in using a single supra-local timetable without having a single uniform standard of time8%056, p&1.

TALES AND LEGENDS OF THE ISLE OF WIGHT.
WITH THE ADVENTURES OF THE AUTHOR IN SEARCH OF THEM. BY ABRAHAM ELDER, ESQ.


I observed to the antiquary that I had hoped to have left Southampton in the forenoon.

"There was a time," he replied, "when two o'clock was in the forenoon."

"How can that be possible?" said I.

"Noon," he replied, "was anciently the *hora nona*, or ninth hour of the Romans, which corresponded with our three o'clock. But the *hora nona*, or noon, was gradually changed, till at length it got put back to mid-day. The reason of this change is rather singular: the monks by their rules could not eat their dinner until they had chaunted their noon-song, which was a service regularly said at three o'clock; but they, after a while, anticipated their devotions and their dinner, by chaunting their noon-song immediately after their mid-day song; by which means they got their dinners three hours earlier. Look! what a number of jelly-fish there are swimming about, looking like large bubbles in the water."


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_timekeeping The English term noon is also derived from the ninth hour. This was a period of prayer initially held at three in the afternoon but eventually moved back to midday for unknown reasons.[10] The change of meaning was complete by around 1300.[11]

https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/noon-history-ninth-prayer-hour-nones What Time Is 'Noon'? So what was special about that ninth hour? In Christian liturgy, the nones, or ninth hour, was one of the three times of day (along with morning and evening) set aside for prayer. The ninth hour is significant at numerous points in Scripture; in the Gospel of Mark, the hours leading up to the crucifixion of Jesus is described as "darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour" in the King James Version and as lasting "until three in the afternoon" in the New International Version.

It is believed that the time allotted for this prayer gradually moved up earlier in the day, perhaps at the urgency of monks who would could only end their fast after the prayer was completed. That time known as noon eventually settled on the time when the sun was in the middle of the sky.

also:

A man named David Price was committed to Hereford Gaol on Friday the 26th, for a burglary in the house of Mr. Jones, near that city. The circumstances are rather singular; the family were out, and on Mr. Jones and his wife's return, they missed the former's watch, which hung by the fireside in the parlour. Mrs. Jones's suspicions being awakened, she went up stairs and returned very much alarmed, informing her husband, that a man was concealed in a large chest which stood in the bedroom; they both went gently up stairs, and shutting down the lid, Mr. Jones seated himself on it and kept the fellow secure until his wife alarmed the neighbours, when they took him and lodged him in prison. The fellow had entered by an upper window which was left open. The watch was found on him.

The local civil day begins twelve hours before and ends twelve hours after
the sun passes the meridian of a place. As the globe is constantly revolving on
its axis, a fresh meridian is every moment coming under the sun. As a
consequence, a day is always beginning somewhere and always ending
somewhere. Each spot around the circumference of the sphere has its own day, and therefore there are, during every diurnal revolution of the earth, an in nite
number of local days, all beginning within a space of twenty-four hours, and
each continuing twenty-four hours. These days overlap each other, and,
theoretically, they are as perfectly distinct as they are in nite in number. There
are no simultaneous days except on the same meridian, and as the different
days are always in the various stages of advancement, dif culties must
necessarily result in assigning the period when an event takes place. The
telegraph may give the exact local time of the occurrence, but it will be in
disagreement with the local times on every other meridian around the earth. An
event occurring any one day may on the instant be announced somewhere the
previous day, or somewhere else the following day. About the period when one
month or year passes into another month or year an occurrence may actually
take place in two different months, or in two different years, according to local
reckoning. [11]

Synchronicity is virtually impossible in a culture of competing timetables, and technological developments in media, in particular the telegraph (and, later, the telephone) but also the railways, exacerbated what comes to be seen as a kind of crisis because of varied interpretations of time. Global space is shrinking, bringing communities closer together than ever before, and time is speeding up, but the result of this is something like a new world order, according to Fleming:

The gigantic system of railways and telegraphs which has been established in
America, has developed social and commercial conditions which never previously existed in the history of the human race. These conditions have affected
the relations of time and distance, in a manner which shows, that the system
of notation which we have inherited is defective; that it leads to confusion, causes loss of time, and disturbs the arrangements of travellers and business
men; that it frequently results in loss of life, and leads to dif culties of various kinds; that under the circumstances which have followed the extensive employment of steam and electricity as means of rapid communication, it is generally
inappropriate. [12]

Here, time is out of joint. It confuses and disturbs, and the asynchronic nature of time even kills. For Fleming, time is a signi cant problem of nineteenth-century industrialized, urban modernity. What is so interesting about the periodical press—so prodigious in offering different schedules and patterns for the shape of everyday life—is the way it both represented anxieties about the shifting nature of time and participated in creating those anxieties.


...

On the one hand, a particular rhythm can create what sociologists of time call 'temporal symmetry' [16]—the daily cycle, the weekly cycle, the monthly cycle, etc.—with readers interacting with the media at roughly the same time. This kind of simultaneity becomes increasingly significant in a collective media culture, and can lead to a form of social bonding with a community of readers all engaged in the same activity. In other words, if time is one of the ties that bond, as Durkheim suggests, and the periodical press is one of the chief ways that time gets organized, then all the different periodicities—each of those segments or cycles of time—are also socially binding. But we also ought to acknowledge that there might equally be temporal asymmetry; that is, because there are competing, overlapping cycles of time that confront the reader in the different periodical cycles in the nineteenth century, the result could as easily be confusion as cohesion.

Innes Shand's uncertainty about the hurried, multitudinous periodicities suggests that one could be out of sync, rather than always in sync. So while there is a repetition of cycles, a regularity to the press in one sense that could lead to a synchronic social experience, there is no single cycle, no single motion which somehow contains it all. Magazine Day, that much anticipated moment when the monthly magazines were published all at once, was one way of organizing time—it was one ritual of media time, as Brake indicates; but, however significant a marker it was, it was only one event on the media calendar, created by the rhythm of the press and publishing industry.

The Industrial Revolution and Time
Alun C Davies 

A stick in the ground – or any conspicuous landmark – cast shadows whose lengths varied as the day proceeded. Sundials were a sophisticated version, though cloud cover rendered them useless. Indoors, candles helped, with burnout times approximated.

Better still were hour-glasses, like giant egg timers, standard items for pulpits and navigators. Those with mechanical skills, in ancient Greece and in medieval Europe, puzzled over the construction of time-measuring devices whose motive power derived either from an unwinding spring or falling weights and whose 'escapements' might be regulated in some way.

From the late seventeenth century the accuracy of the mechanisms gradually improved, especially to the benefit of astronomers and other scientists.

But for most people in an overwhelmingly agricultural economy the natural rhythms of the days and the seasons sufficed. Time was local.

The tolling of church bells to call parishioners to worship or funerals, or to mark occasional calamities or celebrations, occurred at times determined by sun dials.

These were calibrated to the astronomical readings of an enthusiastic squire or vicar. Outside the great observatories, such as Greenwich, the first long-case clocks possessed only one hand to give a rough idea of the time before or after an approximate hour. Greater accuracy than twenty minutes a day was difficult to achieve.

The Industrial Revolution changed all that, in two essential ways. The first transformation occurred in how the passage of time was perceived.

People began to behave and organise themselves in a new way. Second, and equally important, there was a revolution in the way in which clocks and watches were made. Ironically, although Great Britain was the home of the Industrial Revolution – it was the 'first industrial nation' as one historian famously termed it – the new methods of manufacturing timepieces occurred elsewhere, as the essential features of the Industrial Revolution diffused beyond these islands.

The series What The Industrial Revolution Did for Us directly and indirectly touches on changes in the use and perception of time. We see how Captain Cook pioneered the application of the newly developed chronometers to 'carry' Greenwich time with him to the other ends of the earth.

This enabled him to determine longitude more easily and accurately than before, and to attain remarkable precision in his charts and maps, (with an exactness barely improved before satellites).

The revolution in ocean navigation proved of incalculable benefit to Britain's commercial prosperity and national security, as the merchant marine and the Royal Navy became equipped with the equivalents of today's computers.

The Clerkenwell district of London, location of Britain's most skilled horological craftsmen, became the Silicon Valley of the era.

But there is one crucial irony. Its products – beautiful clocks, exquisite watches, and prodigiously accurate chronometers – were handcrafted empiricisms, not the standardised products of a factory. Mass produced timekeepers came later, and not in the country that pioneered factory production, but the United States.

A mention of 'factory production' reminds us of one of its pioneers, Thomas Arkwright. The factories of Arkwright and others involved not only housing large new machines but also applying new kinds of business organisation.

Co-ordination was essential to bring together supplies of raw materials, to organise workers and distribute their output. No point in having workers turn up at any old time, hoping that someone had brought in the cotton or wool to be processed, or hoping that someone had cleared yesterday's output.

Factories demanded considerable time-management. Workers had to be woken by 'knockers-up'; shifts needed to be measured by a factory clock.

As the industrial economy and its transportation network became more and more complex, bulky raw materials and finished products needed synchronised services from canal companies, mail coaches and, later, railways.

For railway passengers, especially, the use everywhere of local time (calculated when the sun was overhead at noon) spelled confusion.

Agreed timetables were essential, as was a standard time. Railways ultimately imposed Greenwich Time across Great Britain.

What about the effect the Industrial Revolution had on the methods of producing clocks and watches? London and the provincial cities were lucrative luxury markets for the products of skilled craftsmen.

But because of a gradual improvement in incomes as a result of the industrial and agricultural revolutions, the market for timepieces was widening.

From the middle eighteenth century the impact of the application of the pendulum and other technical improvements to clocks enabled rural craftsmen, often part-time clockmaker-farmers, to manufacture cheap long case clocks that were respectably accurate.


More precisely, they assembled and finished the small clock components made in Birmingham's new 'toy' factories after the 1770s. Their cottage grandfather clocks were relatively simple mechanisms in bulky clock cases; they needed winding daily but they cost only a few pounds.

They were among the first 'consumer-durables' bought at the bottom end of the market. "When any group of workers passed into a phase of improving living standards", observed the late E. P. Thompson, "the acquisition of timepieces was one of the first things noted by observers."

So, small farmers and artisans acquired thirty-hour pull-wind clocks for their cottages. And in the new industrial towns some of the skilled, better-paid, workers acquired their own personal status symbols: cheap, bulky ('turnip-sized') pocket watches.

The parts were made and sometimes assembled in Liverpool and Coventry and, increasingly, Switzerland. They were not invariably accurate or reliable, but they created a demand for a better watch 'next time'.

However, neither Switzerland, Great Britain, nor any place else in Europe, developed the quintessential features of factory mass production – standardised, interchangeable parts – and applied them successfully to the production of cheap timepieces.

It was in New England, between about 1816 and 1837, that Eli Terry redesigned and simplified clock movements to enable large quantities to be constructed and assembled. Initially they were made almost entirely of wood and then, after 1837, of cheap brass.

The clocks were easy to set up, and could be placed anywhere, on a table, mantel, or wall. They sold for as little as $10 in 1810, and soon after for much much less. They sold by the hundreds of thousands, in the United States and Europe.

Factory production of watches proved more difficult. Their tolerances were finer. But the stream of technological innovations that shaped the design and production of Yankee clocks led, eventually, to the millions of watches annually produced by the great firms of Waltham, Elgin, Hamilton and Waterbury.

The latter's price prompted the immortal advertising slogan "The watch that made the dollar famous". The Industrial Revolution had not only changed our attitude and responses to time. It also revolutionised the way timepieces were produced.

Henceforth, there was a clock for every mantelpiece, and a watch for every person.

"NOTHING IS THE WAY IT SHOULD BE": GLOBAL TRANSFORMATIONS OF THE TIME REGIME IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY
Conrad, Sebastian.  Modern Intellectual History; Cambridge Vol. 15, Iss. 3,  (Nov 2018): 821-848.


In Japan, these European products met with high demand, even if, just as in Europe, they remained a luxury good. Only the feudal lords (daimyô) could afford them. They became known as daimyô tokei, ruler clocks, and served primarily as objects of prestige. And yet, even when the clocks survived the long journey fully intact and undamaged, they were put to markedly different use than their designers had intended. Tokugawa Japan followed a flexible time system: day and night were equally divided into six-hour units. An "hour" corresponded to one-sixth of the daytime—with the day beginning at sunrise (the Hour of the Rabbit) and ending at sunset (the Hour of the Rooster). As such, the actual length of the individual units of time varied with the time of the year (ranging between a hundred and 158 minutes), resulting in the daylight "hours" being significantly longer in summer than in winter.

The introduction of the mechanical clock, with all its precision and regularity, did not have any marked effects on customary ways of timekeeping. Quite to the contrary: instead of adapting cosmology, Japanese craftsmen began to modify the technology. Through a complex process, the balance wheel—used to keep the clock's measurement consistent—was adorned with adjustable weights and was additionally recalibrated twice a day, in order to maintain the varying differences between the daytime and nighttime hours. Moreover, season-specific clock faces adjusted the clock to the local time regime. In this way, the Japanese went out of their way to reverse the emancipation from the cycles of nature that the clock seemed to promise. `[Tsunoyama Sakai, Tokei no shakaishi (Tokyo, 1984); Sawada Taira, Wadokei: Edo no haiteku gijutsu (Tokyo, 1996). For time keeping during the Tokugawa periods see also Yulia Frumer, "Translating Time: Habits of Western-Style Timekeeping in Late Edo Japan," Technology and Culture 55 / 4 (2014), 785–820 10.1353/tech.2014.0116.

The question is, how did the Japanese convert from older timekeepingpractices to new ones? To modern readers, understanding a clock seems almost intuitive; we think of a clock dial as self-explanatory and rather simple. Yet for somebody who has not had the experience of using a Western clock, the information contained on the clock face could be simply overwhelming, and there was nothing obvious about the logic of reading Western time. In the period when all their activities were structured according to the Japanese conventional temporal system, and with nobody to inculcate them in the Western way of reading time, how did Japanese people living in the late Edo period comprehend and learn to work with an alien interface? `[ Recently historians focus more and more attention on the issue of interfaces. See, for example, Thomas Mullaney "The Moveable Typewriter," and Rachel Plotnick "At the Interface".]`

__Mechanical Clocks in Edo (Tokugawa) Japan__

... Mechanical clocks arrived in Japan at the end of the sixteenth century, when Jesuit missionaries bestowed them on Japanese warlords, hoping to facilitate the preaching of Christianity through the presentation of impressive gifts `[The first clock was brought by the Jesuit Francis Xavier and presented to Lord Ouchi Yoshitaka in 1551. Focusing on the cumulative effect rather than a first recorded instance, I broadly place the introduction of mechanical clocks to Japan at the end of the sixteenth century. Yamaguchi Ryuji, Japanese Clocks, and Tamura Takeo, Clocks of Ibaraki.]`

These clocks were critically lacking by Japanese standards because they did not follow the seasonal change in the length of the day and night inherent to the Japanese time system. `[One of the major warlords, Oda Nobunaga, was cited by the Jesuit Louis Frois as saying that "although he liked it, he did not want it because it would be useless in his hands." See Michael Cooper, ed., They Came to Japan, 96, and Hirai Sumio, The Story of the Clock, 129. The variable-hour system was also used in the West until around the fourteenth century, but was gradually replaced by the equal-hours system we use today. For discussions about the reasoning for this change, see classic studies, including Marc Bloch, The Historian's Craft; Jacques Le Goff, Für ein anderes Mittelalter, and recent reconsiderations by Gerhard Dohrn-van Rossum in History of the Hour.]` At that time, the day in Japan was divided into two parts: daylight and darkness, defined by dawn and dusk. `[As both dawn and dusk are naturally continuous processes rather than clearly distinguishable moments, astronomers made the decisions as to which moment to consider to be a turning point. Criteria changed throughout the period and varied by region. See Hashimoto Takehiko, "Kansei Calendar and Japanese Clocks—on the Definition of Dawn," and Watanabe Makoto, "On the Transformations of Time Systems and the Role of the Castle Bell of Kanazawa Castle.]`

Each of the periods lasted six "hours," but since the relative length of light and darkness changed throughout the year, the relative length of these "hours" changed too, so that one hour could be as long as 155.952 modern day minutes, or as short as 76.75. `[Honda Toshiaki Looking at the Stars—Knowing the Hours (Shiseichiji kagami IlSftlSîSS), listed under Time (Shinkoku JJzM) (1789), in Kanö Archive, Record number 7.31706.1.]` Twelve animal signs designated the hours—with midnight associated with Rat and noon with Horse—as did numbers, to allow bell strikes to mark the hour. `[Rat, Ox, Tiger, Rabbit, Dragon, Serpent, Horse, Sheep, Monkey, Rooster, Dog, Wild Boar. Although the twelve animal signs are often mistakenly referred to as "signs of the zodiac," they have no relation to constellations on the zodiac belt.]` However, the numbers were not a growing series from one to twelve but rather two descending series from nine to four. So counting the hours from midnight, one would do so as 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4 and then from noon again as 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4. Dawn and dusk always occurred in the sixth hour, of the morning and of the evening, respectively `[Yamaguchi, Japanese Clocks; N. H. N. Mody, Japanese Clocks-, and J. Drummond Robertson, The Evolution of Clockwork.]` (fig. 1).

The animal signs, the variable hours determined by the season, and the crucial importance of the dawn brings out an association with agricultural lifestyle, moderated only by natural cycles and not bound by the artificial time of a clock. `[The association of variable hours with a "natural" lifestyle is clearly seen in classic works such as those of Thompson and Whitrow, mentioned before.]` This association tempts us to conclude that time-consciousness was not an important factor in this pre-modern society, and that people simply would not need to use timepieces. Yet even before the encounter with Western mechanical clocks, the Japanese used a variety of timekeeping devices to schedule their lives. These were stationary and portable sundials, clepsydras, sand clocks, candlesticks, and incense clocks.

These non-mechanical timepieces were by no means inferior to mechanical clocks (especially those in the sixteenth century) and were used concomitantly with the latter in order to maintain highly time-conscious social practices. `[Although modern authors sometimes attempt to find deeper social meanings in this system, Tokugawa-period scholars themselves discussed it as a mere convention, which may have had deeper meanings in ancient periods but lost those meanings after thousands of years of use. See, for example, Anonymous, The Numbers of the Twelve Hours of Bells and Drums (Jüniji shöko no kazu (1720), copy, in Tokyo National Museum Archive, Record number A38.3208]` The inhabitants of the huge urban centers of Edo Japan engaged in professional, cultural, political, and economic activities that demanded a high degree of coordination. `[By the beginning of the eighteenth century there were almost a million people living in Edo (modern-day Tokyo). Kyoto, Osaka, and Nagoya also had several hundred thousand inhabitants each. The use of variable hours did not prevent people living in those metropolitan areas from thinking in terms of temporal units, and the history of Japanese social temporality did not differ much from the history of Western social temporality described by Lewis Mumford in his classic Technics and Civilization.]` All over Japan people lived by an elaborate system of public bells, evaluated their work in terms of time investment, complained about others' tardiness, and were punished for their own. Work contracts indicated working hours by season and how much one would be paid for overtime work, and stipulated that tardiness would be punished by a pay cut. `[Collection ofTokugawa Popular Costumes, 113-15. For similar cases see Tsunoyama Sakae, The Social History of Clocks, 114, and Morishita Töru, "Time in an Early Modern Local Community," 75.]` The literally omnipresent time-bells allowed workers to follow these seasonal schedules, but also induced anxieties of tardiness. `[In the dense urban centers the sound of bells often overlapped, requiring a higher degree of synchronization. Urai Sachiko, Edo Time System and Time Bells, and Takahashi Satoshi, Edo Litigations.]` The degree of compliance with predetermined schedules was higher among the samurai employed in the governmental bureaucratic machine and among the urban merchant class. But these anxieties reverberated in peasant society as well and reached as deep as the copper mineshafts. `[T. C. Smith, Native Sources of Japanese Industrialization, 1750-1920, 203-19, and Collection ofTokugawa Popular Costumes.]` Concerned with knowing the time of the day, people increasingly used more and more timepieces, non-mechanical and mechanical alike, and in the first half of the nineteenth century most urbanités carried some kind of portable measuring device. `[Already by the beginning of the eighteenth century, mathematician Nakane Genkei stated that clocks had become widespread: Nakane Genkei ), Treatise on Time (Jikokuron date unknown, in Hayashi Archive, Record number 902. By the end of the eighteenth century, astronomer Nishimura Tösato didn't even discuss clocks in his treatise on astronomical measurement instruments, as he deemed them too trivial. Later however, he was annoyed with readers who complained about the lack of clocks and included an image without any explanation. Nishimura Tösato (ffittHSM), Illustrations of Various Measuring Devices (Sokuryö sho ki zu SJÄINHürlSI), date un known, in NAOJ, Record number 2761.]` In 1834, a clockmaker inscribed on the back of one of his devices: "[Clocks] are so widespread, they are used everywhere. Nowadays, there is no professional who doesn't rely on them." `[Katsuno Kondö, "A Hanging Clock with a Round Graph-like Dial," 5. Although many surviving clocks are lavish, we shouldn't assume they were the exclusive province of the rich. It is merely that ordinary clocks were far less likely to have survived the Meiji reforms.]`

The clocks and watches they carried, however, were not the same Western mechanical clocks introduced by the Jesuits more than two centuries before. Western clocks with equal sixty-minute hours, counted in an as cending series, were inadequate to measure the variable Japanese time, but shortly after their arrival in Japan in the sixteenth century, the clocks began going through metamorphosis. In the final years of the sixteenth century Europeans were no longer welcomed on Japanese soil, and the Japanese government began imposing more and more restrictions on their presence. With no European guidance, Japanese instrument makers interpreted the mechanical timepieces according to their own ideas about timekeeping, and devised various methods to adapt European mechanical timekeeping technology to Japanese habits of measuring time, as well as handling, looking at, and reading timepieces. In the course of more than 250 years of the Edo period they came up with a variety of designs which in the nineteenth century were all used concurrently, together with non-mechanical timekeepers. Their prices were determined not necessarily by mechanical complexity, but by the fame of the clockmaker, the artistic qualities of the engravings, and the cost of the materials used in production.

When clocks first arrived in Japan, Japanese craftsmen replaced roman numerals common in European timepieces with the twelve animal signs, and put the midnight hour at the bottom of the dial, as traditionally represented in Japanese clocks. `[Although there were numerous variations. There were some clocks with the midnight hour on the top of the dials, and some clocks had a rotating dial instead of a rotating index hand.]` But the most urgent problem they needed to solve was measuring hours of changing length with a mechanical device specifically designed to maintain a steady speed. The earliest solution, seen already in the beginning of the seventeenth century, was to make the mechanism slow down when necessary by moving weights on the verge-and foliot escapement to an outward position `[Sachiko Oda, Illustrated Guide to Japanese Clocks.]` (fig. 2 `[The double foliot-type Japanese clock, early nineteenth century. The foliot is a balance located underneath the bell. It is attached to the crown wheel, and was originally designed by European clockmakers in order to regulate the speed of the mechanism. Moving the little weights toward the center allowed the crown wheel to rotate freely, but moving them to the outward position slowed down the wheel and consequently the speed of the mechanism. Japanese craftsmen regarded this mechanical function as an opportunity to determine precisely the speeds of the clock at different hours, during different seasons. Initially, following the European single-foliot design, only one balance was used for both day and night hours, so that the user had to adjust the clock twice a day. At the end of the seventeenth century Japanese clockmakers designed a two-balance clock that would automatically switch between day and night, thus theoretically requiring adjustment to the clock's speed only once every fifteen days, when the length of the hour was officially changed. In spite of the seeming advantage of the double foliot, these clocks became popular only during the nineteenth century, and even then did not completely replace the single-foliot clocka.]`). With the introduction of spring-driven clocks in the early eighteenth century, they were able to allow the device to maintain a steady speed but make the hour-digits movable, thus allowing the user to physically increase or decrease the space allocated to an hour on the dial `[See articles in Hashimoto Takehiko, ed., Historical Researches on Technological Characteristics and Social Significance of Clocks and "The Japanese Clocks and Time in the Past."]` (fig. 3).

The fact that digits were not fixed to a certain place on a dial might surprise a modern-day reader; after all, we are so accustomed to the analog dial structure that we don't even need the numbers—we can read time by just looking at the relative position of the index hands. But the Japanese users of the Edo period did not have this conceptual hurdle to overcome because in their experience hour-digits were movable. The movement of the shadow on a sundial naturally varied with seasons, and the signs indicating hours alongside the path of burning incense in an incense clock were placed in different spots at different times of the year. Accustomed to the movable nature of hour-digits in non-mechanical timekeepers, Japanese clockmakers adapted the clocks to the existing habit of tracing the place of digits on the dial.

Technological habits developed from practices involving non-mechanical timekeepers also opened up the possibility of non-continuous measurement of time, and consequently of a non-circular dial. The shaku (ruler) clock is one such example (fig. 4). Its shape is a replication (albeit vertical) of a linear scale on which one measured the length of the gnomon shadow. In imitating the familiar shape, Japanese clockmakers relied on the existing experience of tracing time by following the movement of the shadow on a linear scale, and designed a clock that demanded the same kind of practice. Graph-like clocks also testify to this process of applying existing habits to novel technology. In shaping the appearance of these clocks, Japanese clockmakers replicated the curving lines of paper sundials or diagrams representing the seasonal change in the length of the hours. And relying on the already existing habit of reading time from a diagram by tracing the intersection of the season and the hour-axis, they designed a graph-like clock interface that required the same way of visually interpreting time (figs. 5 and 6). Thus, the Japanese experience with non-mechanical timepieces opened a door to a creative interpretation of mechanical timekeeping technology that came from Europe, and resulted in a variety of designs that evolved through a process of adaptation of existing technological, visual, and conceptual habits.


...


"Small hours" were the Western hours, as there were twice as many of them in one day than normally used in Japan.40 But what was this "koku" that Fujimura Heizö found on a Western clock dial? This term, obviously foreign to any Westerner, came from the sphere of astronomical time keeping that provided infrastructure for practical and technological translation. Although determining the precise length of the variable hours in each and every season was one of the most important tasks of Japanese astronomers, in order to do so, they themselves used temporal systems with units of equal length.

Until the very end of the eighteenth century, Japanese astronomers based their calculations on a decimal system of a hundred equal daily units, called koku, each of which could be further divided into ten bu (parts) or a hundred byö (miniscules).41 When determining the length of a variable hour at a given season, astronomers calculated the dawn and dusk in terms of koku and bu, and then deduced the number of koku and bu in daylight and night hours. Calendrical work, therefore, was largely a task of translation between invariable astronomical units, and the variable, popular ones. This practice was not limited to astronomers, as bell-keepers rang the variable hours based on their measurement of astronomical koku. Moreover, many nineteenth-century Japanese clocks came with an additional gradation of a hundred units and a table, which instructed the owner how to adjust the movable digits on their clocks for each and every season. Thus, having had to translate between the hundred koku and the twelve variable hours, some Edo Japanese developed a habit of juxtaposing two systems of units. Consequently, when confronting the invariable Western temporal units they intuitively saw them as similar in kind to "koku" and thus potentially translatable.

PAST AND FUTURE: THE TEMPORAL
DIMENSION IN THE LAW OF
PROPERTY*
RICHARD A. EPSTEIN

...

A. First Possession: Prior in Time is Higher in Right
Temporal issues arise with evident urgency in the law of real property.
Land itself lasts forever, and the improvements upon it can last for a very
long time. The durability of the asset means that no one person can consume it in a lifetime, so that any legal relations with respect to land will
of necessity involve a large number of persons over a long period of time.
How then are these relationships to be sorted out?
Every one knows and follows the rule of ordinary life that applies to
such prosaic matters as waiting in line for theater tickets or in a cafeteria:
"first come, first served." The rule of first possession at common law
converts that intuition into the analytical foundation for the entire system of private property: the party who takes first possession of a thing is
entitled to exclude the rest of the world from it, forever. The element of
time is part of the priority rule and of the definition of the property interest acquired.

...

... Whoever got there first, wins. ...

... The older the title, the better the title-period. ...

...

More concretely, the first possession rule is relevant in two temporal
dimensions. The first section of this paper spoke of the priority of acquisition. The subject of this section is the duration of the ownership interest thus acquired. On this issue, the basic case yields results that
correspond with the dictates of good sense. Ownership acquired by first
possession is and should be of infinite duration. Only this rule creates a
complete set of definite property rights over all things. Any other regime
leaves unresolved the vital question who has obtained, or who can obtain,
ownership of the thing after the limited period obtained by first possession. Where ownership is not indefinite, the initial period could be measured either in lives or in years. The choice between these time periods
itself has important consequences, but the most critical objections apply
no matter how a limited interest is defined.

Where original acquisition of land or chattels gives only a limited interest, no satisfactory allocation of rights over the remainder is possible.
One possible solution upon termination of the present interest would be
to let the thing once owned revert into the common pool, where once
again it can be subject to acquisition by first possession. Alternatively,
the ownership of the property could revert to the state, best understood
as the group of all other people out of possession. (A one hundred percent estate tax would do it.) The first alternative returns the thing to its
original unowned condition, while the second subjects it to collective
ownership of the public at large-the very result precluded by the basic
first possession rule.

In referring to the past, Kaguru never spe years ago"; instead, they simply refer to whate cular period in question. Such events are kept precise intervals of time. ... In general, a Kaguru seeks some common point of experience between himself and his fellows to serve as the marker for the time period he has in mind; there is no fixed term involved for any time; more than one term may be used by a man in reference to a particular time. Similarly, time becomes less precisely delineated as one goes back further into the past, simply because fewer events are involved which are of present importance to living Kaguru.

..., Kaguru have no occasion to discuss the past with any precision at all, certainly not the past as presented by the period prior to that experienced by the oldest living members of the community. Beyond this point, Kaguru speak only of an undifferentiated past, of "long ago" (katali). It is under this term that Kaguru usually categorise their mythical past, the time in which the Kaguru people first arrived in their present country. Kaguru tales and legends are set either in this "long ago" or else set in a vague, timeless period which is clearly not the present but which is not specified as "long ago" either.

The most frequently heard terms of time reckoning in Kaguru conversation are those relating to days. Indeed, one of the commonest expressions for a long period of time is not a term for years or months but simply "many days" (majua mengi). Kaguru have no traditional week or names of days, but indicate days with reference to the present, "today" (diyelo), ...

Kaguru speak of a day commencing with sunrise, and the word for day (ijua, pl. majua) is the same as that for sun. A day itself is divided into daylight and dark. Unlike the night, which is seen as a period of undifferentiated darkness, the day is divided into a series of steps in the progress of the sun across the sky. Unlike the moon, the sun is believed to be an eternal object which disappears each evening as it enters the land to the west but returns to Kaguru-land from its journey each morning as it rises in the east. In short, it is the daily regularity of the sun

It is primarily in terms of the rains-their arrival and departure-that the Kaguru year is gauged. ...

The Kaguru year is thought to begin with the first rains which come after the five or six months of dry season. Once the first showers have arrived, "another year" (ikonga miaka) has begun and the preceding dry period is relegated to the "ended year" (miaka musha). These first showers usually arrive in mid or late November and are very light, usually lasting less than an hour. They are called ng'hokola some, "sweeping away the ashes." This refers to the winds which, accompanying the showers, blow away the light white ashes of the grass fires so common during the dry season. These fires occur at the very apex of the dry season, at the nadir of fertility in Kaguru-land, and thus the winds are seen as the new cycle of an agricultural year, the resumption of the process of fertility.

THE PROBLEM OF THE DATE LINE IN MEDIEVAL
JEWISH SOURCES
Sacha Stern

...

An objective date line would only be conceivable in the context of a purely natural calendar. This would apply, for example, to an Islamic calendar, or any other lunar calendar, that would depend strictly on the first sighting of the New Moon crescent, and where the evening when the New Moon is sighted would mark the beginning of the month. In such a calendar, the date line would represent the boundary on the globe between those regions where the New Moon was first sighted on one evening and where (typically, further to the east) the Moon was not sighted until the following evening; consequently, the dates of the month in both regions would be one day apart. This natural, lunar date line would necessarily change (i.e. be located elsewhere on the globe) every month, as from month to month the boundary between sighting and non-sighting is never in the same place. In practice, however, Islamic calendars do not strictly adhere to lunar sighting for the determination of the beginning of the month, so that this movable date line remains no more than theoretical (see http://www.islamicmoon.com/global_hijri_calendar.htm; accessed 23 May 2017). Although this date line would be objective, in the sense that it would not depend on any arbitrary agreement, it would not be free of human agency, inasmuch as it would depend on when people happen to have sighted the New Moon. It might be possible to do away with human agency,and define this date line on the basis of when and where the New Moon has met astronomical conditions of first visibility (regardless of whether the Moon was actually seen). These conditions, however, would have to be agreed upon in advance by scientific consensus.

Similarly, an objective date line would be conceivable in a solar calendar in which the year begins at the point of (for example) the true astronomical spring equinox. In this calendar, however, the date line would still depend on an element of convention, as it would be necessary to reach agreement on when the day unit begins. If midnight (however defined) were taken, for example, as the beginning of the day unit, then time zones where the equinox occurred before and after midnight would differ in their dates by one day. Again, in such a calendar the date line would vary from year to year, and would thus be 'movable'.

...

In societies where local calendars are used, i.e. where the use of a calendar is confined to a specific region, a date line is unnecessary: for the date will be the same within the confines of that whole region. The very concept of a date line, in this context, is therefore irrelevant. A date line onlybecomesnecessary when an attempt is made to use the same calendar, or the same week, around the entire globe.

...

The earliest known mention and discussion of the date line is in a treatise popularly known as Sefer ha-Kuzari, written in Spain by the Jewish scholar Judah ha-Levi, in the 1130s. ...

... The Muslim, Syrian scholar Abulfeda,in the prolegomenon to his Geography (completed in 1321), observed correctly that a person travelling round the globe eastwards would gain a day, and another travelling westwards would lose a day, in relation to a third person left at their point of departure (Reinaud, 1848: 4‒5). ...

...

Judah ha-Levi starts by arguing that the beginning of the day of the Sabbath must be calculated from the Sinai desert, or alternatively from Palestine, for two distinct reasons: (1) this is where the Law was given, and (2) this is where the calendar
began after the six days of Creation, when Adam began to count and name the days.

...

> How can it be that Levi, who lives in the navel of the earth, 5 should be now at midday of the Sabbath, whilst Judah, his neighbour slightly away from him to the east, should disagree and say: 'Not at all! We are now in the previous day!'
– can there ever be any mockery or madness such as this?

> In truth, I would generally say that it is completely impossible and unfeasible for people standing together on the same day and seeing together the sun to be calling some of them the day 'such-and-such a day of the week', whilst at that time the others call it the day before or theday after.

Consequently, Isaac Israeli concludes that there is no date line at all. Instead, he argues that the day begins in the eastern extremity of the inhabited world, wherever exactly this may be, and ends in its western extremity. He is presumably assuming a Ptolemaic model of world geography, in which the inhabited world stretches from China in the Far East to Spain in the far west (Ptolemaic world maps remained dominant in the West throughout the Middle Ages; see Mittenhuber, 2010).

Although the date must change somewhere in the uninhabited hemisphere (west of Spain and east of China), in Israeli's perspective this is a vast ocean, and the location of this change is therefore irrelevant and in no need of determination.

...

The emerging conclusion is that in the Middle Ages, the date line was a specifically Jewish concern. Between the twelfth and early seventeenth centuries, Jewish scholars alone were engaged in raising the problem of the date line and discussing where it should be located; the invention of this concept, indeed, can be attributed to medieval Jews, Judah ha-Levi or likely one of his predecessors.

...

My first explanation is that for Jews, the precise definition of the date of Sabbath and the festivals was more important than for Christians or Muslims, because of the strict laws of observance that Jews associated with these days. These laws, indeed, involved complex prohibitions on a large range of works and activities, all carrying the severe penalties of death and annihilation (albeit administered only, putatively, through Divine agency).9 For this reason, any uncertainty regarding the reckoning of the seven-day week and the days of the Jewish calendar could not be left open but needed to be resolved.

On Royal Navy ships of the sailing era the ships bell was used to tell everyone on board what the time was. Usually a half hour sand glass was used and as the Midshipman of the Watch turned it over the bell was rung a number of times to let the crew know how long they had been on watch and when the relief was due to take over. To allow for any discrepancies in turning the glass the naval day started at noon when the noon sight (the Captain and senior officers establishing when the Sun reached it's daily zenith) could be used to start the daily cycle.
