Once upon a time, there wasn't any.

Time that is.

And when there was, it was precious.

Time, which is to say, *the* time *here*, was the same as time *there* where *there* was near *here*, but when *there* was somewhere far off, the time could well be different. Or not. Depending on which way you had to travel to get from *here* to *there*.

When you could only travel at the speed of foot, say, four miles an hour at an even pace, you would be unlikely to travel more that 20 miles in a day. On a good day, a horse powered mail service could travel at double that rate.

Brief history of railway signalling https://dickthesignals.co.uk/onewebmedia/1%20brief%20history%20of%20railway%20signalling.pdf

Henry Booth - elements of ""Uniformity of Time considered especially in reference to Railways and the Electric Telegraph" pamphlet, 1847 in https://ia802608.us.archive.org/20/items/memoirlatehenry00smilgoog/memoirlatehenry00smilgoog.pdf
"The amalgamation of the great companies which formed the London and North- Western, Mr, Booth's  official connection with that company, the extension of the railway system in all directions, and the close connection thus established among places formerly at long distances from each other in point of time^  forced upon Mr. Booth's attention an important  question of special concernment to railway com-  panies and to the community at large. Soon after  the consolidation of the London and North- Western, Mr. Booth, ever prompt and persevering, commenced an attack upon the inconvenient anomaly, the positive annoyance, and palpable absurdity of " a thousand and one '* places in the United Kingdom,  having each a time of its own, and each different from all the others. Mr. Booth's clever brochure  — a letter to the Eight Hon. Edward Strutt, M.P., chairman of the Railway Commissioners, upon " Uniformity of Time," considered especially in reference to railway transit and the operations of the electric telegraph, was one of the most sprightly of his productions, and tempts strongly to quotation. The inconvenience and absurdity inseparable from recognition of "local time;" the utter impossibility of conducting railway traffic, according either to " Bradshaw," or to a Roskell's best chronometer, with any approach to regularity or precision, are cleverly displayed. The demand of the appeal is legal recognition and acknowledgment of only one time throughout the kingdom. Inasmuch as some of Mr. Booth's pictures and descriptions are interesting contributions to history, we venture to transcribe them.

Speaking of things as they were, he gives this description, when the clock strikes, say twelve, either noon or night:—

** The parish clocks in some half a dozen hamlets or fishing-towns in the extreme east, in quick succession, commence the long and dissonant peal; Norwich and Yarmouth, Harwich and Ramsgate, with a hundred clocks and chimes ring vigorously ; Canterbury, Colchester, and Cambridge prolong the feu dejoie; with a thousand intermediate towns and villages, each with its market-clock or market-bell proclaiming its own time; each in succession, but  all without intermission, multitudinous in voice and  key — major and minor, tenor and counter-tenor,  treble, and something more, ringing and mingling their notes unmusical. Westward the noise moves on till it gains the suburbs of the huge metropolis ; Poplar and Limehouse, Stepney and Bethnal Green, each with its clock and bells, with iron tongues and clappers, still in succession, uninterruptedly, unin- termittingly, jar gratingly ; while, as the moving din reaches St. Martin' s-le-Grand, the great bell of St. Paul's tolls with mourning voice in grave rebuke of the passing clamour. And still the din proceeds ; still in its westward course — Brentford and Windsor, Reading and Oxford, Southampton and Salisbury, onward for a mortal hour, * by Shrewsbury clock ; ' while every city, town, or township, hamlet, or extra-parochial place,' as the incessant roar sweeps over its head, marking its particular time, calls out   —' That's my thunder ! ' "

To the generation of to-day, accustomed to ** Greenwich time," from John 0' Groat's House to the Land's End, it seems almost incredible that little more than twenty years ago the following ludicrous scene so racily depicted by Mr. Booth might have been an actual occurrence. He entreats the Post-office authorities, or the Legislature, to exercise commiseration towards their agents in the provinces, on whom devolves the task of adjusting local to London time : —

" Imagine the anxiety of the post-mistress at the village of B , in the far west, when she receives a new scheme of departures of the mail from the county town, twenty-three miles east by north of her own village — the new mail to start from the said county town at llh. 44m. a.m., London time — speed, including stoppages, 9 miles an hour — the problem to be solved being, at what hour, local time, the proposed mail so starting from the county town will arrive at the said village of B , 

" The post-mistress, on receipt of the order, hastens to the schoolmaster of the place, and, having explained her dilemma, 'Madam,' he replies, with the gravity becoming one consulted in a difficulty, * the question you have proposed to me — at what time will the mail arrive at the Post-office at B ,  involves one of our most abstruse problems in mathematics. It were a simple matter, if the solution depended alone on the difference of longitude east or west of Grreenwich ; but the obliquity of the earth's axis, and more especially the elliptic figure of the earth's orbit, — these disturbing causes. Madam, you are aware (the lady was not at all aware) produce no little complexity in the computation by which we would arrive at the desired solution. Not six days in the year do the sun and clock keep even and equable time : my calculation, therefore, will be correct for the 21st of the present month, when the new mail starts, but for no other day in this year of our Lord ; but the differences being small, as the earth moves through the vast ellipse, you will easily make those allowances which the season requires. I will immediately consult my Ephemeris , and in three days I trust I shall be able to tell you, within a few seconds, at what time, on the 21st instant, the mail ought, my dear madam — ought, I say emphatically —  to arrive at the village of B ."

"Having thus oracularly delivered himself, the  learned man retires to his study to consult his Ephemeris, and prosecute his three days' labour ; and the post-mistress returns to her duties more fully impressed than before with the dignity of her office as post-mistress of the place, thankful that she had a fi-iend in need, and quite convinced that the vener-able sage with whom she had just conferred was the lineal descendant of him of whom the poet said : —

* And still the wonder grew,  
That one small head could carry all he knew.

Mr. Booth gives equally graphic illustrations of the absurdities involved by the " local time," or the regulation of time by longitude or by the sun's course as applied to railway traffic. As a remedy for the anomaly and inconvenience, he asks that public clocks and pocket timepieces throughout the kingdom should be regulated to one common time.

That *' at one and the same moment, whether in London or Edinburgh, at Canterbury or Cardiff, the labourer may return to his toil or to his hour of rest, the man of business keep his appointment, and  the traveller regulate his movements with the con-fidence of one who has no longer the fear of the * longitude' before his eyes. There is sublimity in the idea of a whole nation stirred by one impulse ;  in every arrangement one common signal regulating  the movements of a mighty people!"

In this important matter Mr. Booth attained the object of his desire — the evil was exterminated, and he had the satisfaction that Parliament did not as  he conjured it not to do, 'wait the miserable alternative, the euthanasia of a worn-out abuse!'"

[The Building of the present Town Hall, Chester https://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archiveDS/archiveDownload?t=arch-2910-1/dissemination/pdf/JCAS_ns_047/JCAS_ns_047_021-032.pdf]


In the city of Chester, situated just a mile or so from  English border with Wales, the west facing, Welsh facing side of the clock tower on the town hall remains blank: local legend has it that the  citizens of Chester would not even give the Welsh the time of day.

The design for the building was established via competition running from 1862 to 1864. The planning even for that seems to have indicated that project management was not a strong point: 

The lack of timesharing is relatively recent, however: the clock itself was only installed in 1979, 110 years after the town hall itself was completed. In a masterly oversight of budget planning, the cost of winding the clock for an hour day, every day, on top of the cost itself was too much for the original organising Council Committee to bear.

[Action of ejectment: https://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Action+of+ejectment] "Originally the ownership of land in England could be passed to another only by delivering the actual possession of the land. The present owner passed title to another by picking up a clod of dirt on the land and handing it to the other person in front of others from the community. This ceremonial act from ancient times was called Livery of Seisin, or delivery of possession. Instead of a clod, a twig or a key could be handed over as a symbol of ownership, but only later was it permissible to deliver the symbol of ownership anywhere but on the land itself. As time passed and writing became more common, a written deed could symbolize the delivery of ownership. The purpose of the ceremony was to make the acquiring of land a public act generally known in the community, so that disputes were less likely to arise." 
The action of ejectment branched off from this as another action for the relief of one whose possession had been disturbed. By it, the plaintiff might claim that he or she had been in possession of a certain parcel of land and that the land had been taken by the defendant. The plaintiff could do this by obtaining from the clerk of the court a writ of entry—a command from the king telling the defendant to let the plaintiff go back on the land taken by the defendant or to appear in court to answer the charge. The defendant could then appear and deny that the plaintiff had been dispossessed or show that as the defendant, he or she had a prior and better right to hold the land. A trial was held to settle the issue. If it were found that the defendant had wrongfully withheld possession of the property from the plaintiff, he or she could be made to pay an amercement, or fine. This fine became a precedent for the later practice of awarding money damages to the successful plaintiff in addition to restoring possession of the land.

Originally, the action of ejectment was intended to protect the rights of a tenant who leased the land. Ultimately, it came to be the principal method for determining the ownership of real property. When the question of title to land became the issue, it was essential to describe the property as carefully as it would be described in a deed to a purchaser. This led to enforcement of very strict technicalities by the court, and the action of ejectment became less attractive to plaintiffs because of the chance that the case would be lost on a point of procedure.


[Livery of Seisin https://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Livery+of+Seisin / https://law.jrank.org/pages/8328/Livery-Seisin.html   Livery of seisin was the dominant method of transferring land in England until 1536, and it continued to be legal until 1925. The term livery of seisin means simply "transfer of possession": livery means "delivery" and is from the Old French livrer, and seisin means "possession" and is from the Old French saisir or seisir. The concept behind livery of seisin, therefore, was the symbolic transfer of the possession of land. The entire ceremony of transfer was called feoffment with livery of seisin, with feoffment meaning "a gift," specifically a gift of a freehold interest in a parcel of land. The transferor was the feoffor, the transferee was the feoffee, and the land interest was the fief.

In the Middle Ages, a livery of seisin was essential to convey land from one party to another; without it no real right to land could be transferred. When performing the ceremony, the feoffor, the feoffee, and their witnesses generally stood on the land itself, though it was permissible to stand within view of the land if the feoffee made an actual entry to the land while the feoffor was still alive. During the ceremony the feoffor spoke appropriate words declaring the gift, and then handed the feoffee an object representing that gift, such as dirt, turf, or a twig, or even a ring, a cross, or a knife. If a house was being transferred, the ring of the door might be exchanged.

In addition to delivering possession of the land, the feoffor needed to vacate the land. The feoffor's tenants and others living on the land were expelled, along with their possessions. In some cases, the feoffor performed a ceremony or gesture showing Abandonment of the land, such as by making a sign with the hands, jumping over a hedge, or throwing a rod to the feoffee.]
The Real Property Act of 1845 (8 & 9 Vict. ch. 106 [Eng.]) did not abolish livery of seisin, but it did allow deeds to be used freely as granting devices, which had the same effect. The Law of Property Act, passed in 1925 (15 & 16 Geo. 5, ch. 20 [Eng.]), finally abolished the livery-of seisin ceremony.

"The action of ejectment branched off from this as another action for the relief of one whose possession had been disturbed. By it, the plaintiff might claim that he or she had been in possession of a certain parcel of land and that the land had been taken by the defendant."

Back in the day, every place had its own time. Not just its own local village fete, its own market day or County Assizes, but its own time.

When it was midday in Oxford it was just after five *past* twelve in London (or 5 minutes and two seconds passed twelve to be precise). At the same time, it was five minutes *to* twelve in Bristol.

Time followed the sun.

So when people said "London is ahead of the times", that was true, in a certain sense: daylight gets there before many places in the UK. And if people say, "the folk in the West Country are so behind the times", that's could also be true...

Every evening at 9 o'clock "Oxford Time" (which is to say five *past* nine in London time), the bell  at Christ Church College, Great Tom, rings out a hundred and one times, once for each of the college's original 101 students, calling the colleges to lock their gates. Thereupon, it remains silent until it resumes announcing the London hour, every hour from 8am the next morning. To this day the people of Oxford know their own time.

As they do in Bristol. If you're ever on the Big Island, and happen to visit Bristol, and if you find yourself stood in from of the old Corn Exchange, look up to the clock tower: as well as the rather unusual red painted numbers, you'll notice it has *two* minute hands. The red minute hand shows London time, Greenwich Mean Time; but a *second*, __black__ minute hand shows local Bristol time, 10 minutes behind.

Having your own time could lead to problems. In 1858, at the Dorchester Assizes, a hearing was set for 10 o'clock a.m. The case involved an action of ejectment, which is to say a property case. In those days, ownership of land could be transferred by ritual and custom as much as it was by legal document.

The medieval *livery of seisin*, which remained as valid in law until 1925, fewer than a hundred years ago, when my own grandparents were children, required the original landowner and whoever was being given the land, along with any witnesses to gather somewhere on the land; the owner would then pick up a handful of earth and hand it over, literally handing of the ownership of it.

If there was a land dispute, an "action of ejectment" could be brought by someone who argued that they had wrongfully been dispossessed of the land or had a better right to it.

*I don't know if the particular case involved the livery of seisin, but it makes for a more colourful story if it does!*

And so it was that on November 25th, at 10 am, the case of Curtis versus March, in the matter of an action of ejectment, was called.

"The plaintiff's counsel commenced his address to the jury, but as the defendant was not present and no one appeared for him, the learned Judge directed a verdict for the plaintiff. The defendant's counsel then entered the Court and claimed to have the cause tried, on the ground that it had been disposed of before 10 o'clock."

The Judge looked to the clock in the court, and it showed the time a little after 10. The defence had *not* been in court at the appointed time, had not been there to provide a defence, and so, because there was no defence, the case had gone against them.

The defence counsel perhaps coughed, and spluttered, pointing to the town clock that could be seen through the window of the court: it was still one and a half minutes *to* 10 o'clock.

If you look at where Dorchester is on a map of England, you find it just above, and to the right of Weymouth; if you look further up the map, higher in latitude but at the same *longitude*, you'll see it's just slightly to the right of Bristol...

...and as such, almost 10 minutes behind London time.

In Dorchester, the town clock was running on local time; the court clock was set to Greenwich mean time, to London time. The defence council, checking the time by the town clock, had arrived, or so he thought, in good time.

The case was taken to appeal in the Court of Exchequer, in London, also known as The Exchequer of Pleas, who considered the matter and made their decision: "[w]hen it is stated that a court will sit at a particular hour, that is understood by all persons as the time at the place where the court sits. We are as much bound to take judicial notice that a particular place lies east or west of Greenwich, and consequently has a different time from it, as we are to know the days of the year". 

The Exchequer of Pleas ruled in favour of the defendant, allowing them to have "an opportunity of trying the cause".

"A person hearing that the court would sit at 10 o'clock would naturally understand that to mean 10 o'clock by the time of the place , unless the contrary was expressed . In this case, looking to the difference of time (of which we are bound to take judicial notice), the defendant was in court before 10 o'clock."

If the trial is set in Dorchester, to be on Thursday at 10 in Dorchester, then the case will be heard, on Thursday, at 10, in Dorchester, using the local time of that place.


Such is the way of the law in Britain and Ireland, a *Common Law* approach, where judges rulings in the absence of statute, or interpretation of enacted laws and statutes, are the law, Curtis versus March defined "standard time" as used in the courts of Great Britain and Ireland.

Standard time as London time, as Greenwich mean time, GMT, did not enter the statute book until 1880, and the reign of Queen Victoria, in an August 1880 "Act to remove doubts as to the meaning of Expressions relative to Time occurring in Acts of Parliament, deeds, and other legal instruments".

Watson B had taken his seat on the bench at Dorchester punctually at ten by the clock in the Court, and the cause being called on and the defendant not appearing had directed a verdict for the plaintiff.

plaintiff versus defendant

CURTIS v . MARCH . Nov. 25 , 1858

*The time appointed for the sitting of a Court must be understood as the mean time at the place where the Court sits, and not Greenwich time, unless it be so expressed.*

This was an action of ejectment which was entered for trial before Watson , B., at the last Dorchester Assizes. The time appointed for the sitting of the Court was 10 o'clock A. M., and the learned Judge took his seat on the bench punctually at 10 by the clock in Court. The cause was then called on , and the plaintiff's counsel commenced his address to the jury, but as the defendant was not present and no one appeared for him, the learned Judge directed a verdict for the plaintiff. The defendant's counsel then entered the Court and claimed to have the cause tried, on the ground that it had been disposed of before 10 o'clock.

At that time it wanted one minute and a half to 10 by the town clock . The clock in Court was regulated by Greenwich time, which was some minutes before the true time at Dorchester. The learned Judge having refused the application, *Cole* had obtained a rule nisi for a new trial upon affidavits of the above facts, against which *Slade* and *Kingdon* showed cause . — The sitting of the court was properly regulated by Greenwich time.

[ POLLOCK, C. B. - When it is stated that a court will sit at a particular hour, that is understood by all persons as the time at the place where the court sits. We are as much bound to take judicial notice that a particular place lies east or west of Greenwich , and consequently has a different time from it, as we are to know the days of the year. ] A judge may appoint the sittings of the court by Greenwich time.

[POLLOCK, C. B.- No doubt ; but that was not done in this case. Suppose a question arises as to whether a person died at 12 o'clock on a particular day, is that to be determined by the time of the place or Greenwich time ? ] The time to be observed at any place is determined by a resolution of the authorities or general course of the parties at that place. Greenwich time is observed at most places in England through which railways pass, and in some the clocks have two sets of hands, the one showing Greenwich time the other the time of the place.

H. T. Cole appeared to support the rule, but was not called upon .

POLLOCK , C. B .--We are all of opinion that the defendant ought to have an opportunity of trying the cause. The rule will therefore be absolute without costs. It seems to me doubtful whether this application is in consequence of mistake on the part of the defendant or his counsel, for it may be that the Dorchester town clock pointed to Dorchester time, although that in court was regulated by Greenwich time, and that this circumstance was not generally known in Dorchester. I cannot assent to the argument that the town council of any place may by their resolution declare that Greenwich , or any other time, shall be the time of the place ; for I cannot help seeing the consequences. The difference between Greenwich time and the real time at Carlisle is several  minutes, and therefore if a town council might determine the time, they might make a man born on a different day from that on which he was really born . Or suppose that by act of parliament a person was bound to go out of office on a particular day, the town council by altering the time might put him out of office to-day instead of to-morrow . So, if a person is entitled to a bonus from an insurance office in the event of his living to a certain period , that must be decided , not by the town council adopting Greenwich time, but by the mean time of the place. Ten o'clock is 10 o'clock according to the time of the place, and the town council cannot say that it is not, but that it is 10 o'clock by Greenwich time. Neither can the time be altered by a rail way company whose railway passes through the place, nor by any person who regulates the clock in the town-hall. A person hearing that the court would sit at 10 o'clock would naturally understand that to mean 10 o'clock by the time of the place , unless the contrary was expressed . In this case, looking to the difference of time (of which we are bound to take judicial notice), the defendant was in court before 10 o'clock .

Watson, B. — On the day when the cause was tried, I came into court punctually at 10 by the clock in the judges' room , which was set at Greenwich time. I proceeded at once with the business. A few * 69]minutes afterwards Mr. Cole came in and stated that it was not yet 10, but I did not hear whether he meant by the mean time of the place or by Greenwich time. That is now explained by the affidavits, from which it appears that two times are kept, the clock in the court being regulated by Greenwich time.

CHANNELL, B., concurred . Rule absolute.

[2nd August 1880.]

WHEREAS it is expedient to remove certain doubts as to whether expressions of time occurring in Acts of Parliament, deeds, and other legal instruments relate in England and Scotland to Greenwich time, and in Ireland to Dublin time, or to the mean astronomical time in each locality:

Be it therefore enacted by the Queen’s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows; (that is to say,)

[Meaning of expressions relating to time.]
1. Whenever any expression of time occurs in any Act of Parliament, deed, or other legal instrument, the time referred shall, unless it is otherwise specifically stated, be held in the case of Great Britain to be Greenwich mean time, and in the case of Ireland, Dublin mean time.
[Short title.]
2. This Act may be cited as the Statutes (Definition of Time) Act, 1880.




https://mylesdungan.com/tag/curtis-v-march/ : "The prominence of local time—i.e. the actual time at a specific location, rather than a centralised version of same—came about in the United Kingdom in 1858. At that time we were members of the august configuration of stroppy nations. On 25 November of that year the defendant in Curtis v March, due to be heard by a judge in Dorchester failed to show up for his hearing and lost his case. He appealed on the basis that he’d been told to be in court at 10.00 am and had turned up on time, according to the local time on the town clock, but not in line with GMT. He won his appeal and that ruling defined ‘time’ in the UK as local, until the 1880 legislation which standardised it in Britain and left us twenty-five minutes adrift."

## How Time Flies

Although my daughter lives away from us now, we try to meet up with her several times a year: Christmas and New Year, Easter, and around her birthday in February. Visiting her one year, I met one of her friends who was telling everyone she could this rather strange thing: *the day before yesterday I was twenty one, next year I'll be twenty four*. How could this be so?


__Answer:__ she told the story on New Year's Day; her birthday was on New Year's Eve.

By the 1840's there were at least three organisations which suffered inconveniences because of the use of local times - the railways, the telegraph companies, and the Post Office.

In June 1836, John Henry Belville, who was employed at the Greenwich Observatory in London, started making a weekly visit to the principal chronometer makers in London, he took a pocket chronometer with him, set to Greenwich time.

In November 1840, the Great Western Railway ordered that London time should be used in all its timetables, and at all its stations.

In 1845 the Liverpool and Manchester Railway company unsuccessfully petitioned Parliament, to ask that a single uniform time be used for all ordinary and commercial purposes.

In January 1846, the North Western Railway introduced London time, to their station at Liverpool and Manchester.

On 22nd September 1847, the Railway Clearing House recommended that every railway company in Britain adopt Greenwich time at their stations, as soon as possible.

In 1st December 1847, the London and North Western, and the Caledonian Railway both adopted London time.

Bradshaws Railway Guide for January 1848 list the London and south western, London and North western, Midland, Chester and Birkenhead, Lancaster and Carlisle, East Lancashire and the York and North Midland railways as all keeping Greenwich time.

In November 1840 GWR announced that a standardised time – railway time as it was called - would be observed at all their stations. Several other railway companies followed suit and on 22 September 1847 the Railway Clearing House decided that GMT should be adopted as the standard time on all railway stations across the country.

Alaturka Saat and the Spread of Mean Tim
The Ottoman hour system traced its origins to the ancient scheme of"seasonal” or "temporal” hours, according to which the day and the night were eachdivided into a set of twelve equal units. Daytime hours were counted from sunrise to sunset and night time hours, from sunset to sunrise. As the length of daytime and night time changed throughout the year, the seasonal hours varied in length accordingly.

According to the system devised by Ottoman astronomers in the fifteenth century, if not earlier, two cycles of twelve equal hours were counted from sunset, reckoned as twelve o’clock palace circles.
6 It seems safe to assume that by the second half of the eighteenthcentury, thousands of timepieces were marketed throughout the Ottoman domains every year.

7 Seasonal hours were ill suited for the new devices, as their length equaled the standard hours of the clock only on the two equinoxes. Equinoctial hours, by contrast, were fully compatible with the uniform hours of the mechanical clock except that the need to adjust all clocks and watches to show 12 at sunset wore down their mechanisms.

8 Since sunset ( gurub) was the baseline of this unique Ottoman arrangement, just as it was in the system of seasonal hours, the names gurubi (and ezani) saat remained in use and were in fact at least as common inofficial correspondence as the now better-known term alaturka saat. For the sake of clarity, however, I will use this last term throughout this study and elaborate on the cultural and political meanings it carried in the second half of the article.

9 In order to evaluate correctly the alaturka  system, we need to re-place it in the "temporal culture" from which it emerged. The term "temporal culture” here denotes the vast ensemble of practices, behaviors, and concepts that concern the social organization of time and fill it with meaning. In contrast to modern,artificially lit societies, in the temporal culture of early modern Ottoman society sunset brought an end to the daily cycle of social life, as people withdrew from the public sphere into the safety of their homes. Moreover, sunset marked the beginning of a new calendar day and the beginning of a new cycle of religious ritual.
10
It thus made perfect sense to set the clock to start a new cycle at this time, with the call fo

 Greenwich, time and ‘the line'
 On why the prime meridian is where it is...
 ...
 There is a standard account of the genesis of the Prime Meridian in Greenwich. Although Britain had taken the meridian (north
–
south line of longitude) to which the Greenwich transit instrument was aligned as a reference point for navigational data, charts and maps since the 18th century and for most timekeeping purposes since the mid-19th century, guidebooks and websites explain that it became an international standard in 1884. This was the result of an international conference held in Washington,D.C. at which delegates from 25 countries were asked to settle on a common initial meridian from which to measure time and longitude. They voted overwhelmingly in favour of the Greenwich meridian

For Great Britain, where the Greenwich meridian was already taken as the initial, or prime, meridian for most mapping and timekeeping purposes, the Washington recommendations would have far less impact on either ordinary or official life than elsewhere. Yet the government did nothing to make them law and the only immediate result of the conference was that William Christie, the Astronomer Royal, changed the hands of the 24-h public clock outside the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, on 1January1885(Fig.1).This was in accordance with another of the Washington recommendations: that the astronomical day, traditionally reckoned from midday, should conform to the civil day, beginning at midnight
 ...
 Instead, popular periodicals, from Nature to Punch, suggest that attention and anxiety focused on the replacement of a.m. and p.m. witha 24-h notation. The chief topics for discussion appear to have been the design of clocks and watch dials and the question of whether public clocks should strike 13
–
24 times after midday. Articles and letters from late 1884 and early 1885 suggest a perception that the Washington resolutions were binding and that the 'new reckoning' of time came into force on 1 January 1885, as symbolised by Christie's action
...

here were suggestions that watchmakers were encouraging the notion that not just new dials but new 24-h movements would be required.
7
Even
 Nature
, although aware that the 24-h notation was likely only to be used by railway and telegraph companies at present, thought it ‘‘proper
 . . .
 to consider in what way ordinary watches and clocks could be best accommodated to such a change in the reckoning’’.
8
Their suggestions about 24-h movements or double dials and, especially, the raising of the issue of how many times a public clock might strike at night caused a ﬂurry of correspondence with some even more tortuously complicated suggestions as well as dismissive rejections of any such measures
 ...
[This focus on clock dials was partly related to knowledge of the 24-hour public clock at Greenwich but also the various suggestions put forward by Sandford Fleming,the great champion of Universal Time, which included dials with both 24 numbers in Roman numerals and 24 letters of the alphabet, ]

Some Oddities of the Law
on Age: So You Thought You
Reached Age 21 on Your
21st Birthday?
David Pollard*

> The common law seems to have taken this principle to a logical extreme when dealing with reaching (or attaining) a particular age. Clearly a person is in their first year until they reach the day of their first birthday. Ignoring parts of the day, this means that they complete their first year (and so become treated as age one) at the end of the day just before their first birthday.
> So far so good, but the common law seems to then have treated this as meaning that the person completed their first year at the end of the day before their birthday and so, ignoring part of a day, actually became aged one at the beginning of the day before. And so on for other ages.
> ...
> '6. It is difficult to avoid confusion of thought in this by-way of the law, for the settled rule as to when full age is attained was itself born in confusion. When, in the 17th century, judges came to think that on the day before a person’s twenty-first birthday he should be held to be of full age, the general principle as to the indivisibility of a day was treated as providing a logical foundation for the conclusion.
>
> 'In truth it did not provide a foundation for the conclusion at all. It did justify treating the whole day of the birth as a day of life, so that twenty-one years might logically be considered complete at the end of the day before the twenty-first anniversary of the birth. But it was in the next step that fallacy seems to have intruded. The end of the day before the anniversary was taken to be a part of the day, so that the twenty-one years were held to end on the day, and hence (on the principle of the indivisibility of a day) at the beginning of the day

```
Captain Shurey who had sadly died (of wounds received in action) on the day before his 25th birthday (he was born on 22 July 1891 and died on 21 July 1916). His father's will had left assets to such of his sons as 'shall attain the age of 25 years'. So the issue arose as to whether Captain Shurey met the condition. Sargant J (in an unreserved judgment) held that he had. Sargant J followed several earlier cases 11 and held that:

'a person attains the age of twenty-one years, or of twenty-five years, or any specified age, on the day preceding the anniversary of his twenty-first or twenty-fifth birthday, or other birthday, as the case may be.'

Trust Law International, Vol. 34, No. 1, 2020, 25 Sargant J noted that the 'popular sense' of the words might indicate that you had to reach the actual anniversary date, but he held that: 'There is nothing to show that in this will the testator was not using the words in their legal sense'.

He noted that legislation had seemingly recognised this 'slight legal anomaly' by enacting in the National Insurance Act 1911 in s 79 an express provision:

'that, for the purposes of the part of that Act in which the section is placed, a person shall be deemed to have attained the age of seventeen years, not on the day preceding the anniversary of his birth, but on the actual seventeenth anniversary of the day of his birth.'

...

before 1969 some of the legislation expressly removed the common law
rule. National Insurance Act 1911, s 79 stated:

'A person shall be deemed according to the law in England, Wales, and Ireland, as well as according to the law in Scotland, not to have attained the age of seventeen until the commencement of the seventeenth anniversary of the day of his birth, and similarly with respect to other ages.'

```
```{admonition} Family Law Reform Act, 1969

Section 9 states:
‘9 Time at which a person attains a particular age  
(1) The time at which a person attains a particular age expressed in years shall be the commencement of the relevant anniversary of the date of his birth.  
(2) This section applies only where the relevant anniversary falls on a date after that on which this section comes into force, and, in relation to any enactment, deed, will or other instrument, has effect subject to any provision therein.
```

> It seems best to consider that someone born on 29 February only reaches a further year of age on 1 March and not 28 February in a non-leap year.1


```
Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) now applies throughout the UK by statute (save to the extent that British Summer Time applies): see the Interpretation Act 1978.19 Section 9 states: '9 References to time of day : Subject to section 3 of the Summer Time Act 1972 (construction of references to points of time during the period of summer time), whenever an expression of time occurs in an Act, the time referred to shall, unless it is otherwise specifically stated, be held to be Greenwich mean time.'

This section is apparently derived from the Statutes (Definition of Time) Act 1880, s 1.

The Summer Time Act 1972, s 3(1), as amended, provides that: ‘Wherever any reference to a point of time occurs in any enactment, Order in Council, order, regulation, rule, byelaw, deed, notice or other document whatsoever, the time referred to shall, during the period of summer time, be taken to be the time fixed for general purposes by 'the Summer Time Act 1972'.

However, nothing in the Summer Time Act 1972 affects the use of Greenwich Mean Time for the purposes of astronomy, meteorology or navigation, or affects the construction of any document mentioning or referring to a point of time in connection with any of those purposes: s 3(2). So pension schemes seem likely to need to use Summer Time and probably not GMT even if (I suggest) the scheme relates to astronomers, weather persons or navigators.

What happens if an Act of Parliament relates to actions outside the UK? In R v Logan, 22 British soldiers stationed in Hong Kong were convicted of assault that happened at about 2.30am on 1 January 1957. They were convicted under a UK Act, the Army Act 1955, which only came into force on 1 January 1957. They appealed on the basis that the relevant UK Act had not, at the time of the offence, yet come into force in Hong Kong (being eight hours ahead of GMT)

...
This defence was dismissed. Lord Goddard held:
‘If an Act is said to come into force on January 1, it comes into force on the day which is January 1 in the particular place where the Act has to be applied. I can well understand that if an offence were committed in the Western Atlantic the Act might not be in force  there on the same day as it would in London because the date might still be December 31 there, but the fact that it became January 1 in Hong Kong a few hours before the clock would actually show January 1 in England does not make any difference. As the Act comes into force on January 1, 1957, in Hong Kong, it comes into force on the day which is January 1 in Hong Kong. Therefore, this point fails and the appeal is dismissed.

```

```

So that the date and time of an event or of an act are ordinarily the date and time determined by the calendar and clock at the place where the event happens or act is done, notwithstanding that the actual occurrence is at different times in different parts of the world.

When effluxion of time has to be considered, a somewhat similar result occurs. Suppose twins born at Greenwich on the same day; the elder, born just before his brother, remains in England; the younger comes to Sydney, and immediately on coming of age speaks by telephone to his elder brother in England. He is an adult, his brother is still an infant. Yet the duration of their infancy is computed from the same moment, namely the beginning of the day they were born.

Some interesting situations can be imagined on this basis with results even more striking than the experience of Phileas Fogg. It seems, however, that any question of personal rights, capacities, disabilities, or qualifications gained or lost by the lapse of a given period of time must be determined according to the clock and the calendar at the place where the person in question is. This matter is not directly relevant here; but it illustrates that concepts concerning the expiry of a given period of time, are elusive and in a sense artificial; and the legal problems they create must be determined by the application of rules of law

If this is followed in the UK (and there seems no reason not to), this would fix the time of reaching a particular age by the relevant time (presumably the official time) in the jurisdiction in which the person actually is at that time (even if they were usually resident elsewhere).

The International Date Line
and Related Issues

When all the people in the world lived in the same area, this
was not an issue. Everybody lived in one region and it was 2:35 PM
on Thursday for everybody simultaneously. When people began to
wander to other lands, those who wandered east were always ahead
of the ones who stayed home. Similarly, those who wandered west
were always behind those who stayed home. Theoretically, if the
east nomads met up with the west nomads, there would be a
problem, because the east nomads kept track of the days ahead of
the original settlement, and the west nomads kept track of the days
behind. Thus, when they met, they would be one day apart.
An arbitrary date line is unacceptable for Jews, though,
because we must keep accurate count of the days, since many
halachot depend on the day of the week - most significantly,
Shabbat. We cannot simply agree to treat tomorrow as Shabbat, on
our own whim!
...
When an airplane flies west, it travels in the same direction as
the sun, so the time will not advance significantly throughout the
flight. If so, one who flies west on the morning of a fast day should
theoretically not be allowed to eat until the fast is over, which is
some time after sunset. His fast would then be much longer than
everyone else's, because he began his fast in the morning of his
departure place, but ended it at night in his destination place.

https://www.networkrail.co.uk/stories/180-years-of-railway-time/
 November 1840, The Great Western Railway – on Isambard Kingdom Brunel’s line from London to South West England – told all stations to use London time.

According to the Science Museum, an 1841 timetable for the GWR line from London to Bridgewater said: "LONDON TIME is kept at all the Stations on the Railway, which is about 4 minutes earlier than READING time; 5½ minutes before STEVENTON time; 7½ minutes before CIRENCESTER time; 8 minutes before CHIPPENHAM time; 11 minutes before BATH and BRISTOL time; and 14 minutes before BRIDGEWATER time."

 Book of Sun-Dials:
8These twelve parts, however, would alwaysdiffer in length according to the season, e$cept at the equinox, because the ancients always reckoned their day from sunrise to sunset: Gatty, 1872, p 671

After the mechanical clock was invented, a sundial would still be needed to adjust the clock at noon each day as the early mechanical clockworks were accurate only for a limited period of time ;4Malley, %007, p 61

+ven though the formal standardisation of time occurred a hundred years later, one could say the transition started in the late eighteen century when the idea of Mean Time began to winground. Mean Time is a mathematical solution developed to solve mechanical problems identified by clock makers. Different from sundial time in its regularity, Mean Time divides the day in totwelve, equally long hours. In ??erubavel4s informative study *The Standardization of Time: A Socio-historical Perspective*, we learn how 8=loc time as we know it today, did not come into being until %&5(, when Geneva first started to use "mean time" in preference to solar time8 %056, p 71. Mean time allowed a standard view of how to tell time, however, the conception of time was still a local matter

Local time is the term used to describe the use of local timekeeping. +Een though a used clock show mean time, it still had to be set at noon each day, which gives unique time on each possible location. As a result of the flexion of the Earth, time differs four minutes every degree of longitude, which gives a 6 minutes of time difference across Britain /chivelbusch, %0&&, p @(1

TALES  AND  LEGENDS  OF  THE  ISLE  OP  WIGHT.
WITH  THE  ADVENTURES  OF  THE  AUTHOR  IN  SEARCH  OF  THEM. BY  ABRAHAM  ELDER,  ESQ.


I observed to the antiquary that I had hoped to have left Southampton in the forenoon.

" There was a time," he replied, " when two o'clock was in the forenoon.

" How can that be possible ? " said I.

" Noon," he replied, " was anciently the *hora nona*, or ninth hour of the Romans, which corresponded with our three o'clock. But the *hora nona*, or noon, was gradually changed, till at length it got put back to mid-day. The reason of this change is rather singular : the monks by their rules could not eat their dinner until they had chaunted their noon-song, which was a service regularly said at three o'clock ; but they, after a while, anticipated their devotions and their dinner, by chaunting their noon-song immediately after their mid-day song ; by which means they got their dinners three hours earlier. Look ! what a number of jelly-fish there are swimming about, looking like large bubbles in the water."


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_timekeeping The English term noon is also derived from the ninth hour. This was a period of prayer initially held at three in the afternoon but eventually moved back to midday for unknown reasons.[10] The change of meaning was complete by around 1300.[11]

https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/noon-history-ninth-prayer-hour-nones What Time Is 'Noon'? So what was special about that ninth hour? In Christian liturgy, the nones, or ninth hour, was one of the three times of day (along with morning and evening) set aside for prayer. The ninth hour is significant at numerous points in Scripture; in the Gospel of Mark, the hours leading up to the crucifixion of Jesus is described as "darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour” in the King James Version and as lasting "until three in the afternoon” in the New International Version.

It is believed that the time allotted for this prayer gradually moved up earlier in the day, perhaps at the urgency of monks who would could only end their fast after the prayer was completed. That time known as noon eventually settled on the time when the sun was in the middle of the sky.

also:
A man named David Price was committed to Hereford Gaol on Friday the 26th, for a burglary in the house of Mr. Jones, near that city. The circumstances are rather singular; the family were out, and on Mr. Jones and his wife's return, they missed the former's watch, which hung by the fireside in the parlour. Mrs. Jones's suspicions being awakened, she went up stairs and returned very much alarmed, informing her husband, that a man was concealed in a large chest which stood in the bedroom; they both went gently up stairs, and shutting down the lid, Mr. Jones seated himself on it and kept the fellow secure until his wife alarmed the neighbours, when they took him and lodged him in prison. The fellow had entered by an upper window which was left open. The watch was found on him.
