A WITCH—MARVELLOUS REVELATION ! Sarurpay.—If Mrs, Mary Doheny lived in the “ merrie olden times,” she would just now be in imminent danger of having her body constituted ma- terials for an auto-da-fe. Her achievements in the “ black art” have been the theme of horror and wonderment amongst the good folk of Carrick-on-Suir, and a magisterial investigation has but tended to add fuel to the flame of con- sternation which the announcement of her powers had given existence to. For years past she has lived in affluent cir- cumstances by selling love potions to romantic and foolish girls, while she occasionally netted respectable sums amongst farmers’ wives with whom things were not going altogether smoothly. But she surpassed herself when she succeeded in enrolling two steady members of the constabu- lary force on the list of her votaries, and enmeshing, one of them at least, in debt to a considerable amount in sup- plying her extraordinary demands upon him. Sub-Constable Joseph Reeves has outlived the first buddings of youthful enthusiasm; he is a married man, of some five and forty years of age, and the father of a family. Some time ago his eldest daughter became ill, and hearing of the curative powers of Mrs. Doheny, his wife engaged ber services and the child improved somewhat. Henceforward, Mrs. Do- heny became a frequent guest at the tea-table of the con- stable, and time she predicted that ere long he would be in affluent circumstances, inasmuch as some of his relatives and connections who had been dead for years had come to life, and would soon be permitted to show them- He was also led to believe that Sir selves upon the James Power, who died some ten years ago, took a deep interest in his well-being, and purposed giving him some landed property, and the result was that a correspon- dence was carried on between them, and the constable received no less than twenty-five letters and a gold ring from the occupant of the grave, the missives in question being regularly forwarded by Mrs. Doheny, and the replies came through her, and were sometimes found in an old moat on the To attest ber powers still further, she made an assignation with the constable to meet him in a certain field at a particular hour, and there she revealed to him the person of his father-in- law, William Mullins, standing at a few yards’ distance, dressed in a blue coat with brass buttons, a kpee breeches, coarse stockings and shoes; he was not allowed to address the vision, which was beheld by his son, a boy about nine years of age, at the same time. She alsoshowed him others of his friends, &c., who had been dead ; amongst others, hisson William, who departed this life some five or six years ago. This the constable deposed to on oath before the magistrates on Saturday, and as regarded her power in this respect, he was corroborated on oath by his wife. Mr. Hanna, who, with Messrs. Jephson and Wilson, presided, asked himif he had been drinking at the time, and the man replied that he had not tasted spirituous liquors for the past twenty-two years. This appears strange, to be sure, but then there is further testimony. Sub-constable Hayes is brought forward, and he deposes on oath that the woman has brought up before him several of his friends and connections who had been dead for years, and in this statement he is also corroborated by his wife. For weeks after, Mrs. Doheny is supplied with meal, for the sustenance of the potatoes, tea, &c., dead who have come to life, and on more than one occasion, some tobacco was sent to old Mullens, who, it appears, was in his lifetime a great smoker. To meet these demands Constable Reeves got into debt, but the promise of gold and landed property induced him to resort to extensive credits to furnish supplies. New potatoes were at one time returned to him, with a request from the dead that they should be exchanged for old, and on one oc- casion some eggs were sent back with word that they had not agreed wfth the dead son William. Mr. Heard, the energetic and most intelligent sub-inspector, at length got intelligence of what was going on, and he de- termined to make inquiries in reference thereto ; Reeves’ was removed to Clonmel in conseqnence of the debts he had contracted, and learning the cause thereof, he proceeded to Mrs. Doheny’s house, where he found the letters (twenty five), from Sir James Power, which she had when the thing got noised abroad. He also got three bottles containing tea, cream, and milk, made up in a clean white handker- chief, and which Mrs. Doheny acknowledged were to have been forwarded to some of her defunct clients on the same evening. The house was otherwise comfortably furnished, and the dame appeared to live well on the credulity of the people. She was, of course, arrested, and the t proceedings were instituted. It was a strange thing to witness in a public court of justice—a number of intelligent people apparently in their senses deposing to such things on oath in the presene of magistrates. Whatever spell she may have wrought, there is no question of doubt but that the policemen named and their families still place implicit faith in her, for when being removed to the dock, Reeves shook her by the hand, and asserted such, and in re- ply to one of the magistrates, said, “ Sir, if you had seen as much as I have you would be of the same opinion.” After taking down in writing Reeves’ evidence, and he having signed same, the magistrates were about to adjourn dressing Doheny, said, “ Have when! Mr. Wilson, ad you anything to say, now that you have heard this statement ?” The woman coolly replied, “ He wanted te see his dead relatives, and, dead or alive, or on horseback, I showed them to him. Mr. Heard had the woman’s husband—a blind (?) man—arrested on Friday evening. He travels through the country led along by a “ dark” guide, and on heing question- ed he acknowledged that his worst day’s receipts for some time past was 2s. 9}d., while occasionally they We realized six or seven  shilllngs in a day. learned that some time ago the female prisoner gave a neighbouring woman an awful beating, and yet nobody could be got to prosecute her, fearing that she might be- witch themselves or their children.

A STRANGE CASE OF WITCHERY IN TIPPERARY. It would appear from recent revelations in Carrick-on-Suir that witchery has not been exor- cised there. A remarkable case of its power to unseat rationality has just been brought under the judicial cognisance of the local magistracy, through the energy of Mr. Hy 3.1, and the police. No fewer than seven of them members of the Constabulary force of the conntry—are found to be completely subject to the “black art.” But we cannot wonder that even the matter-of fact community of our Irish police are not proof against the power of a vil- age enchantress, When modern dations have shown that no circle has been found too distin guished—no society too learned or too literary be drawn within the spiritual influence of the world-renowned home, or of the possessor of the famous “ Crystal Bull,” even in the heart of London, and in this the nincteenth century. Some fourteen months ago, a woman named Mary Doheny, the wife of a blind man, appeared in the town of Carrick-on-Suir, professing to be able to reveal fto the living the forms of those supposed to he long ago dead, and among her dupes were two policemen, who, strange to say, implicitly believed in her power, and scrupu- lously obeyed her behests, It is stated that she has “drugged” her victims,  LOTS MORE TO DO

THE TIPPERARY WITCH. There is something much more pleasant and touching about the Irish rustic superstitions than there is about the English. Superstition makes the English boor -imply brutal and pitiless, while in the Irish peasant it excites the lively credulous imagination of a child. The belief in fairies or kindly preternatural agencies has wholly vanished from England, while the belief in demons or the black art still lingers to a considerable extent. How different j the state of feeling is in Ireland the very curious examination of three or four “bewitched” people before the magistrates of Carrick-on-Suir,Tipperary, Thursday week will sufficiently show. The witch was one Mrs Mary Doheny, the wife of blind man, who appeared at Carrick-on-Suir about fourteen months ago with reputation for preternatural powers which she soon began to sustain and increase. , The charge against her was cheating certain persons afterwards examined in court, and who were evidently far from admittirg that they had been cheated all, out of subsidies not in money but in food, on the false pretence that they were for the ! support of deceased relatives of the contributors recently restored to life—or sufficiently so to need food. The scene in the Court House of Carick-on-Suir was a very curious one. People of all ranks thronged from all sides to hear the examination, and even the most educated persons present were, it is said, in parts of the CjOdence visibly awestruck and confounded ifceHßiniple fkith wad earnest testimony of more than one witness to the preternatural facts alleged. The witnesses called against Mrs Doheny certainly testified to the continuous stream of subsidies with which they had supplied her for their rather uncomfortably situated relatives—who appear to have half got back from the grave, but still to be, if we may so term it, spiritual invalids living on earth, but in mysterious seclusion amongst the “good people,” and preparing on a mild diet of tea and other food generally known to the medical profession “slops" for their more active return to life; but while they gave this evidence they not only imputed no falsehood to Mrs Doheny, but were even eager in their simple faith that the subsidies had actually been needed and consumed by their half-reanimated kinsmen, whom they had, they said, seen with their own eyes. There is something inexpressibly childlike about the whole story. In reading it we feel as if we were present at the birth of one of those Irish fairy legends related with much spirit by Mr Lover, in which humpbacks sleeping in haunted moats so please the good people’’ as not only to get rid of their humps but have them transferred to the persons of their cruel enemies, or banshees flit round decaying mansions wailing forth the deathsong of some one of its inmates. There were no fewer apparently than five independent witnesses who asserted that they had seen the forms of relatives long dead restored life, always it appears in Mrs Doheny’s presence, though she does not seem to have claimed any power in the matter. The first witness was Sub-Constable Joseph Reeves,” who stated that after Mrs Doheny’s appearance at Carrick-on-Suir some fourteen months ago she began to doctor his child for him with herbs. The child was afflicted with epilepsy, and Mrs Doheny’s remedies certainly gained it quieter sleep, he thought, that it had ever had before. Bat after this little experiment in the healing art, in which she does not appear have been strikingly successful, she seems to have diverted her energies into more exciting channels. We are told that one night at twelve o'clock, while Mrs Doheny’s medical attentions were being directed to the child, Mrs Reeves, the wife of the sub-constable, had a vision when she was “in bed, but not asleep,’’ of her deceased father Mr Mullins, who said “he would return home m« in perfection”—whatever that may have meant. Mrs Doheny had not said anything to me of my father till I told her this circumstance,’ but the remark appears to have been carefully laid in Mrs Doheny’a heart, and to have suggested the important change of her “ base of operations” from administering physical sedatives to the child to administering spiritual stimulants to the parents. After the hint dropped by Mrs Reeves, that her father would return to her “in perfection,” Mrs Doheny appears to have made statements the effect that he had returned to life, and would soon manifest himself to his daughter and her family. About four months or more ago “Sub-Constable Joseph Reeves” was asked by Mrs Doheny go with her Knock roe. where fee would* see hi» kto father-in-law. The man, accompanied by his boy Terence, child of eight years of age, started, but on getting to Knockroe appears have seen nothing till Mrs Doheny came up ten minutes after him, when pointing in a particular direction she asked Reeves if he saw anything. I replied, * Yes,’ for I saw father in-Law William Mullins, who had been dead three years, about 20 yards distant from me.” Asked by the magistrate whether he was frightened. Reeves replied simply. “ I was not. sir; this rare case in a court of justice, and laughable one to people, but there have been instances of the kind before.” He had known his father-in-law, he said, for 16 years, and “ought” to know him. “We remained looking him for time; was standing in the field with a stick in his band; his side-face was turned towards me. There was good light at the time, about eight o’clock in the evening. I don’t think William Mullins is dead now, but he teas dead. I have- been sending him food for the last four months since he came to life. I sent bread, butter, and tea once in each of the twenty-four hours, sometimes by the defendant asd sometimes by my wife's niece. Defendant asked in my presence for the food, and as it was after I had seen William Mullins alive, 1 consented.” Reeves further said that he had lost a son named William, who had died seven years of age in 1860. Two months ago Mrs Doheny told him “ to to Duggan's waste-house and I would see him.” This he did, again with his sou Terence, and he asserts that they both saw his late son William standing inside the window with dead aunt (Margaret Power) who had died about seven years ago. They came the window and I walked up to it. —there was only the glass between us. . . The boy Terence remarked to me when they came to the window, There’s Will and his aunt.’ ” We may casually note here the remarkably tenacious memory of the living boy Terence, who is only eight years old. His little brother had died when be was only four years old, and his aunt when he was only one year old; but he recognises them at once. The dead or risen boy was said to be in the same clothes which he died. The magistrate, asking if the lad had had his clothes when he died, his mother, who was sitting in court, cried out, “Oh, God help us! he had, he had!” and Reeves goes on, “ Yes, he died in his chair; he appeared to me to have grown since he died; he did not look very badly, though he was delicate ; he had no hat on.'' Of the aunt he says that she did not wear crinoline, they were not in fashion when she died,” —but we are not assured whether she died in those clothes or has There also appears to have been separate manifestation of some of these deceased persons Mrs Reeves MraDoheny, shesaid, brought her father “and showed him me. She also showed me Tom Sheehan (a deceased relative of Reeves), who was lame, and my own child. They were all alive.” The niece of Mrs Reeves, who is described as a “ line, intelligent girl," also swore positively that every night, -but after dark,” —she brought tea, milk, butter, bread, and other food, and gave them to her uncle Tom Sheehan, who was always standing under the wall of the old waste-house.” She swore positively that it was to her deceased uncle Tom Sheehan, and no one else, that she delivered the food. A fifth witness was ex-policeman, James Hayes, but as he had known none of the deceased parties in their lifetime except by description, his evidence only proved that he had seen persons whom he believed on his friends’ word to be dead people restored to life. These persons still appear to in a very delicate state. The dead lather Mullins indeed seems to be hearty, under the protection of the good people,” smokes, and can manage new potatoes and eggs. But Mrs Doheny said my sisters and son were too delicate eat new potatoes and eggs, and I changed the diet next night” Some tea was sent back not good enough for the wards of the fairies, two months ago, and irosh tea of a better quality was substituted. William Mullins wanted clothes but once ; and then he made shift with one of his daughter’s chemises for shirt. The promise held out by Mrs appears to that ail these shadowy forms now undergoing their novitiate for a second earthly life in the deserted house near the moat of Ballydine will, after due assimilation respectively of new potatoes, eggs, and bread and milk by the harder , men, and superior tea by the boy and women, be able to come back quite to life, and that whenever that occurs, they will “bring their living with them,” —an event apparently much to be desired, as the intermediate state is rather expensive to relations who are still enjoying their./ir*< lease of life, and oa whom it is rather hard to ask them to work so hard for relatives who are about to enjoy their second. However, when they quite return to life they are to bring not only money but land in the county of Waterford”—or perhaps rather the title to itwith them, which is certainly a consolatory hope ; only as the title can only have been gained a conveyance effected the other world, it must still be a liaraasiug doubt the sub-constable whether earthly lawyers will recog validity

*The Carrick Witch.*— Mary Doheny, the old lady who set "Carrick and the country" in a blaze by her "witchcraft,"  was convicted at Clomrel quarter sessions on Wednesday, and sentenced to twelve months' imprisonment.

The Camkick Witch. —Mary Doheny, known the Garrick Witch,” was tried the Clonmel Quarter Sessions last week for fraudulently obtaining goods from Joseph and Mary Reeves, at Carrick-on-Suir, the Ist of June, 1864. Mary Reeves deposed that the prisoner had attempted to cure one of her children with herbs boiled in new milk, and continued attending the house for that purpose nearly every day during ten months. She said she used to sec her dead father and other dead members of the witness's family in the Moate, Balleydine, and, as a proof, the prisoner said that the witness was to get note for them, which Captain .fames Power was to write for them. The witness’s child was sent for the note, and several letters were received purporting to come from the deceased relatives. The prisoner next said she wanted bread, butter, and tea for the people in the Moate, and these were daily supplied during four months. The witness also fancied that she saw her own deceased father. He was sitting in a chair opposite the door, quite near her, having on blue coat, knee breeches, and hat. He said three times he was going, and that he would return with plenty; and the prisoner said he was going with the gentry,” but would return. The prisoner often asked the witness for wine and spirits. Since her arrest there had been no from the other world. The husband of this woman, Joseph Reeves, sub-constable, was great a dupe his wife. He said that he saw and knew his father-in-law, w’ho was only twenty yards from him. He believed that the man had come to life, and thought he had a ghostly appearance. He never saw dead man standing before. He saw his son also in an empty house, where he was brought by the prisoner. He, too, had ghostly appearance, and had not the shape of living person, and the prisoner stated that it would take a considerable time for him to come Iterfcction. The jury found the prisoner “Guilty.’’ Mr. Sergeant Howlcy, who presided on the Bench, stated that he had been Informed by Mr. Heard, sub-inspcctor of constabulary, that the dead persons had been personated by the prisoner’s blind husband, and a man who led him about. One of the apparitions was at dark, and the other in the night. The prisoner then cried, Oh, my Lord, think of my poor blind man and poor children! and the Court answered, You are terrible woman and a dangerous impostor. You must be confined in gaol for twelve months, and kept hard labour.”
