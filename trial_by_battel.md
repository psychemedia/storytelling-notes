The attorney-general moved for leave to bring in a bill to abolish it, but after debate the motion was postponed.

The Last Wager of Battle in England

There has died in Birmingham a poor old man,one event of whose history forms an important mark in the progress of civilisation in England, especially as relating to the old barbarous mode of settling disputes, and trying causes by the "wager of battel." The deceased, William Ashford, was the last person who was challenged in an English court to meet in single combat a man whom he had accused as the murderer of his sister. On the 26th of May, 1817, a beautiful young woman named Mary Ashford, in her twentieth year, went to dance at Erdington without proper protection. She left the festive scene at a late hour, accompanied by a young Abraham Thornton, farmer's son in the neighbourhood. They were last seen talking together at a stile near the place, but next morning she was found dead in a pit of water; and there were fearful evidences that she had been abused, violated, and murdered. General suspicion pointing to Thornton, he was arrested, and tried for murder at Warwick Assizes in August ; but though strong circumstantial evidence was given against him, the defence, which was an *alibi*, obtained " not guilty." The feeling of surprise and indignation of his acquittal was so intense that a new trial was called for, and an appeal was entered against the verdict by William Ashford, the brother and next of kin to the murdered girl. Thornton was again sent to London in November, to be tried before Lord Ellenborough and the full Court of Queen's Bench. Instead of regular defence by arguments, evidences and witnesses, Thornton boldly defied all present modes of jurisdiction, and claimed his right, according custom, to challenge his accuser to fight his innocence or guilt by the " wager of battel." His answer to the question of the Court was, "Not guility and I am ready to defend the same by my body." He accompanied these words by the old act of taking off his glove and throwing it down upon the floor of the court. At this stage of the proceedings, William Ashford, who was in court, actually came forward and was about to accept the challenge by picking up the  glove, when he was kept back by those about him. With what wonder did the assembly, and indeed the nation, ask, "Can a prisoner insist upon so obsolete a mode of trial in such a time of light as the nineteenth century?" But with greater wonder and regret was the judgment of the Court received ; for, after several adjournments, in was decided in April, 1818, that the law of England was in favour of the "wager of battel ;" that the old laws sanctioning it had never been repealed ; and that,those this mmode of trial had become obsolete, it must be allowed. Thronton was therefore discharged, and being set at liberty left this country for America, where he died in obscurity.
