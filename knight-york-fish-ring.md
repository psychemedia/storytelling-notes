# The Fish and the Ring

The English folk tale "The Fish and the Ring" is a classic fairy tale in which someone of low-birth is prophesied to marry someone of much greater social standing. Although obstacles are put in place to prevent the marriage, a happy ending ensues. Although this story felt familiar to me when I came across it in a modern collection, *English Fairy Tales and Legends*, by Rosalind Kerven (2008/2019), under the title "The Knight of York (Yorkshire)", I don't recall any particular occasion, if any, on which I have heard it told.

A popular variant of the English version of the tale of *The Fish and the Ring* was first published in a popular form in Joseph Jacobs *English Fairy Tales*, 1890. The gist of that version is as follows:

> A shopkeeper in York has a large family that just got larger. A nobleman calls, sees their distress at another mouth to feed, and offers to read the child's fortune: he is shocked to learn she will marry his son, so he offers to adopt her and takes her away, at which point he throws her in the River Ouse. A farmer finds her and brings her up. Years later, the nobleman comes across her again, is persuaded to read her fortune, and realises who she is. He writes a letter to his brother saying the girl will bring shame and misfortune on the family, and she should be killed at once. He asks the girl to deliver the letter in Scarborough. Along the way, she stops at an inn, a thief sees the letter and swaps it for another ("marry the girl to my son as quickly as possible — she will bring great honour and fortune"). The girl delivers the changed letter, and is married to the nobleman's son. The nobleman arrives, furious, takes the girl outside, throws a ring into the sea saying she can only return if she has the ring. She finds work in a kitchen; there is a feast, and the nobleman and his son (her husband) will be there. She finds the ring in a fish; the fish is served to the nobleman and the girl is revealed. The son chastises the father and they all live happily ever after.

In the telling, I've found there are several tricky bits: getting the fortune telling to work in a coherent way, handling the girl's exile as triggered by the loss of the ring, and disguising the girl in the run up to the denouement. There is a natural opportunity to break the story with a cliff hanger when the letter is switched in the inn, or at the point at which the nobleman's brother reads the letter. In the original telling, what the thief replaced the original letter with is described at the time of its substitution, but we can hide that until the letter is opened and read. Or perhaps describe preparations for a great event that is revealed as a wedding, not an execution, and then explain the actual contents of the letter. There is also an opportunity to include the use of a hand of glory when the thief enters the inn. Indeed, in the resource that Jacobs got the story from, Baring Gould's appendix to Henderson's *Notes on the Folklore of the Northern Counties of England and the Borders*, 1866, the (Yorkshire) tale of the *Hand of Glory* is described, as well as the (Yorkshire) tale of the *Fish and the Ring*.

So let's see how Jacobs (re)told the tale:

XXXV. THE FISH AND THE RING.

ONCE upon a time there was a mighty Baron in the North Countrie who was a great magician and knew everything that would come to pass. So one day, when his little boy was four years old, he looked into the Book of Fate to see what would happen to him. And to his dismay, he found that his son would wed a lowly maid that had just been born in a house under the shadow of York Minster. Now the Baron knew the father of the little girl was very, very poor, and he had five children already. So he called for his horse, and rode into York, and passed by the father's house, and saw him sitting by the door, sad and doleful. So he dismounted and went up to him and said : " What is the matter, my good man?" And the man said : "Well, your honor, the fact is, I've five children already, and now a sixth's come, a little lass, and where to get the bread from to fill their mouths, that's more than I can say."

" Don't be downhearted, my man," said the Baron. "If that's your trouble, I can help you. I'll take
away the last little one, and you won't have to bother about her."

" Thank you kindly, sir," said the man ; and he went in and brought out the lass and gave her to the Baron, who mounted his horse and rode away with her. And when he got by the bank of the River Ouse he threw the little thing into the river, and rode off to his castle.

But the little lass didn't sink ; her clothes kept her up for a time, and she floated, and she floated, till she was cast ashore just in front of a fisherman's hut. There the fisherman found her, and took pity on the poor little thing and took her into his house, and she lived there till she was fifteen years old, and a fine handsome girl.

One day it happened that the Baron went out hunting with some companions along the banks of the River Ouse, and stopped at the fisherman's hut to get a drink, and the girl came out to give it to them. They all noticed her beauty, and one of them said to the Baron: "You can read fates, Baron, whom will she marry, d'ye think ?"

"Oh! that's easy to guess," said the Baron; " some yokel or other. But I'll cast her horoscope. Come here, girl, and tell me on what day you were born?"

" I don't know, sir," said the girl, " I was picked up just here after having been brought down by the river about fifteen years ago."

Then the Baron knew who she was, and when they went away he rode back and said to the girl : " Hark ye, girl, I will make your fortune. Take this letter to my brother in Scarborough, and you will be settled for life." And the girl took the letter and said she would go. Now this was what he had written in the letter :

" Dear Brother : Take the bearer and put her to death immediately.  
" Yours affectionately,  
" Humphrey."

So soon after the girl set out for Scarborough and slept for the night at a little inn. Now that very night a band of robbers broke into the inn, and searched the girl, who had no money, and only the letter. So they opened this and read it, and thought it a shame. The captain of the robbers took a pen and paper and wrote this letter :

" Dear Brother : Take the bearer and marry her to my son immediately.  
" Yours affectionately,  
" Humphrey."

And then he gave it to the girl, bidding her begone. So she went on to the Baron's brother at Scarborough, a noble knight, with whom the Baron's son was staying. When she gave the letter to his brother he gave orders for the wedding to be prepared at once, and they were married that very day.

Soon after the Baron himself came to his brother's castle, and what was his surprise to find that the very thing he had plotted against had come to pass. But he was not to be put off that way ; and he took out the girl for a walk, as he said, along the cliffs. And when he got her all alone he took her by the arms, and was going to throw her over. But she begged hard for her life. " I have not done anything," she said, "if you will only spare me I will do whatever you wish. I will never see you or your son again till you desire it." Then the Baron took off his gold ring and threw it into the soa, saying : " Never let me see your face till you can show me that ring ;" and he let her go.

The poor girl wandered on and on, till at last she came to a great noble's castle, and she asked to have some work given to her ; and they made her the scullion girl of the castle, for she had been used to such work in the fisherman's hut.

Now one day, who should she see coming up to the noble's house but the Baron and his brother and his son, her husband. She didn't know what to do ; but thought they would not see her in the castle kitchen. So she went back to her work with a sigh, and set to cleaning a huge big fish that was to be boiled for their dinner. And, as she was cleaning it, she saw something shine inside it, and what do you think she found ? Why, there was the Baron's ring, the very one he had thrown over the cliff at Scarborough. She was glad indeed to see it, you may be sure. Then she cooked the fish as nicely as she could, and served it up.

"Well, when the fish came on the table, the guests liked it so well that they asked the noble who cooked it. He said he didn't know, but called to his servants : " Ho, there, send the cook who cooked that fine fish." So they went down to the kitchen

and told the girl she was wanted in the hall. Then she made herself ready and put the Baron's gold ring on her thumb and went up into the hall.

When the banqueters saw such a young and beautiful cook they were surprised. But the Baron was in a tower of a temper, and started up as if he would do her some violence. So the girl went up to him with her hand before her with the ring on it ; and she put it down before him on the table. Then at last the Baron saw that no one could fight against Fate, and he handed her to a seat and announced to all the company that this was his son's true wife ; and he took her and his son home to his castle ; and they all lived as happy as could be ever afterward.

6. THE FISH AND THE RING. ( Yorkshire .)

There lived in York three hundred years ago a very poor man, who had a little shop under the shadow of the Minster towers. He had already three daughters and two sons when his wife gave him hopes of a sixth child. Nor were these expectations blighted, for in due course of time she presented him with a little girl. The poor man groaned at the sight, took the child, and laid it on the counter before him, shedding tears at the prospect of having another mouth to fill. A knight who was riding by heard his sobs, and inquiring the cause, learned that the new babe was *un petit peu de trop* in the house. Now, being a sorcerer, the knight opened his great Book of Fate, and as he read therein his hair bristled on his head, and his cheek grew pale, for he saw it plainly written that this nursling babe was to be his son's wife. Determined to avoid this catastrophe, he offered to adopt the child and endow it with all bis wealth. The delighted father agreed, and gave the babe into the arms of the knigjit, who carried it to the hanks of the Ouse and flung it in. But the little creature did not sink. Its dress buoyed it up, and it was washed ashore near a fisherman's cottage. This good man, finding the poor wailing child on the river-bank, brought it home, and with his wife's consent adopted it, and under their roof it grew up to be a handsome girl of fifteen.

One day the knight came riding along the river with a number of friends. They called at the fisherman's cottage, and asked for some fish. The girl came to the door, and all the riders were struck by her beauty. As they continued their ride, they praised her much for her courteousness and the loveliness of her face, till the knight jestingly said he would search the Book of Fate to see who should be her husband. He did so, and found, to his terror, that this girl was the same whom he had flung over the bridge and believed to be dead long ago. So, leaving his comrades, he rode back to the cottage and asked the fisherman to allow his daughter to take a letter for him to his brother, a noble knight, at Scarborough. Then he wrote a letter to this effect:—

' Dear Brother, — Take the bearer and put her to death immediately.—Yours affectionately.'

Sealing this, he gave it to the girl, and she started on her journey. On the way she slept a night in a little inn. Now it fell out that a thief broke into the inn that night and entered the maiden's room, where he found the letter, and opening it he read it. Then turning his dark lanthorn on the face of the sleeping girl, he thought, 'How sad that this beautiful damsel should be the bearer of her own sentence of death ! Surely she deserves a better fate.' Then, taking a pen, he wrote on paper a note, as though from the knight, telling the brother to marry the girl to his son. Having done this, he sealed the letter and placed it in the girl's purse, whence he had abstracted the real letter. She, waking the next morning, and knowing nothing of what had. taken place during the night, hastened to Scarborough, where she was well received by the knight's brother. He read the letter, and gave immediate orders for the celebration of her nuptials with the knight's son, who was then staying at his castle.

Some days after, the knight arrived at his brother's mansion, and was much astonished and perplexed to see the course which affairs had taken, and to find that all his attempts to frustrate the purposes of fate had been in vain. However, he was not a bit more disposed than before to take matters quietly, so dragging the poor girl to the shore by her hair, he drew his dagger to stab her. She fell on her knees and implored him to spare her life, on which he so far relented that he plucked a golden ring from his finger and cast it as far as he could into the tumbling waves, saying to her, ' Swear to me that you will not come within my sight till that ring is on your finger, and I will spare your life.' She took the requisite oath and fled the place.

Far and wide did she wander, begging from door to door, till at last she found a situation as cook in a nobleman's house. One day, when guests were arriving, she looked from the window and saw the knight, her cruel father-in-law, and his son, her husband. Trembling, she hid herself in the kitchen, and her tears were mingled with the food she dressed. Just before dinner a fisherman came to the door with a magnificent fish for sale. She took it in and began to clean it. Scarcely had she opened it when she saw something glittering in its stomach. She examined the shining substance—and, lo! it was the knight's ring ! Her heart was now full of joy, and her tears were lost in smiles. She cooked the dinner so well that the knight, her father-in-law, asked his host who was bis cook.

'A strange girl,' replied he, ' who came begging to my door, and whom I received into my house from charity. Ho! some of you servants, bid her come up into the dining-hall.'

The girl, receiving this command, washed her face, braided her hair, and put on her best array; then, with the ring on her finger, she entered the hall where all were feasting.

The revellers turned to look at her, for she seemed as fair as the moon, as lovely as a rose. With an exclamation of rage and dismay, the knight rose to his feet. He recognised her at once, and, drawing his sword, rushed forward to cut her down; but she held up her hand with a smile, and there he saw the ring he had east into the sea. Now, at length he acknowledged that he was powerless to resist fate, and suffered her to remain in peace with his son, who loved her dearly, and she became famous through the land for her beauty, her courtesy, and her goodness.

p326-7

This story is made up of two story-radicals :

A. The first as far as to the marriage;

B. The second from the marriage to the end.

The first part of the story closely resembles 'The Devil with the Three Golden Hairs,' in Grimm's Kinder-Märchen, No. 29; to which are also related a Swiss story of Vogel Greet (K. M. No. 165), a Swedish tale (Afzelius 2, 161-167), a Norwegian (Asbjörnsen, No. 5), a Wendish tale (Haupt u. Schmaler, No. 17), a Hungarian (Mailan, No. 8), and a Mongolian tale in Gesser Khan, p. 142. In the German story a king takes the place of the knight, and the babe is a boy born with a caul, and therefore fated to marry his daughter. He takes the boy and casts him into the water, and it is saved by a miller. The incident of the change of letters by the thief is the same. After this the German tale branches off in another direction altogether. A modern Greek household tale (Von Halm, No. 20) is to this effect: It is prophesied that a babe will cause the death of a merchant; the merchant takes the child, as in the Yorkshire and German story, and casts it into the river, when it is saved by a shepherd. Then follows the recognition of the boy, when grown up, by the merchant, and the incident of the letter; after which the story goes off on another track. The same story exists in the ' Gesta Romanoram.' `[Ed. Swan, vol. i. Tale 20.]` It is impossible not to recognise in the myth of Romulus and Remus as an Italian form of the same widespread household tale localised.

The second part of the same Yorkshire story is founded on a different root, and one which reappears in numerous tales. Tor instance, in ' Herodotus,' it is told of Polycrates ; in the old Provencal romance of ' Magelone ' it more closely resembles the form in the Yorkshire tale. If I remember aright, it occurs in one of the ' Arabian Nights' Entertainments ; ' and if so, it was a relic of Persian romance, and would, in all probability, be found in India as well. I am not sure that it has not a mythical signification, and that the ring apparently lost in the sea, and recovered from it again, does not portray the sun cast, as it were, by the power of darkness into the deep, and recovered again by the virgin Aurora or the dawn. The instances of the reappearance of this root in household tales are too numerous to be specified. I may mention that it occurs in the familiar French tale of ' The Fair One with Golden Locks,' and that we find it in all the kindred tales of the Aryan family.

It might be worth exploring the use of the hand of glory at the point where the girl stays the night at the inn, and use this as a cliff-hanger in a split version of the tale.

Note that Henderson also includes extensive notes on the hand of glory (), and Groome's appendix includes a version (p332-333).


The Golden Ball, as collected by Groome, is also in the same book (p333) and involves a hanging — possibly make a triptych, where the gallows are the source of the dead man's hand?

The Giant with the Three Golden Hairs

THERE was once upon a time a poor woman whose son was born with a caul, and so it was foretold of him that in his fourteenth year he should marry the King’s daughter. As it happened, the King soon after came into the village, quite unknown to any one, and when he asked the people what news there was, they answered, " A few days since a child with a caul was born, which is a sure sign that he will be very lucky; and indeed it has been foretold of him that in his fourteenth year he will marry the King’s daughter."

The king had a wicked heart, and was disturbed con- cerning this prophecy, so he went to the parents, and said to them in a most friendly manner, " Give me up your child, and I will take care of him." At first they refused, but the stranger begged for it with much gold, and so at last they consented and gave him the child, thinking, " It is a luck-child, and therefore every thing must go well with it."

The King laid the child in a box, and rode away till he came to a deep water, into which he threw the box, saying to himself, " From this unsought-for bridegroom have I now freed my daughter."

The box, however, did not sink, but floated along like a ooat, and not one drop of water penetrated it. It floated at last down to a mill two miles from the King’s palace, and in the mill-dam it stuck fast. The miller’s boy, who was fortunately standing there, observed it, aud drew it ashore with a hook, expecting to find a great treasure.

When, however, he opened the box, he saw a beautiful child, alive and merry. He took it to the people at the mill, who, having no children, adopted it for their own, say- ing, "God has sent it to us." And they took good care of it, and it grew up full of virtues.

It happened one day that the King went into the mill for shelter during a thunder-storm, and asked the people whether the boy was their child. "No," they answered, "he is a foundling, who, fourteen years ago, floated into our dam in a box, which the miller’s boy drew out of the water." The King observed at once that it was no other than the luck-child whom he had thrown into the water, and so said to them, " Good people, could not the youth carry a letter to my wife the Queen ? If so, I will give him two pieces of gold for a reward."

" As my lord the King commands," they replied, and bade the youth get ready.

Then the King wrote a letter to the Queen, wherein he said, "So soon as this boy arrives with this letter, let him be killed and buried, and let all be done before I return."

The youth set out on his journey with the letter, but he lost himself, and at evening came into a great forest. In the gloom he saw a little light, and going up to it he found a cottage, into which he went, and perceived an old woman sitting by the fire. As soon as she saw the lad she was terrified, and exclaimed, " Why do you come here, and what would you do?"

" I am come from the mill," he answered, " and am going to my lady the Queen, to carry a letter ; but because I have lost my way in this forest, I wish to pass the night here."

" Poor boy," said the woman, " you have come to a den of robbers, who, when they return, will murder you."

" Let who will come," he replied, " I am not afraid ; I am so weary that I can go no further, and stretching him- self upon a bench, he went to sleep. Presently the robbers entered, and asked in a rage what strange lad was lying there. "Ah," said the old woman, "it is an innocent youth who has lost himself in the forest, and whom I have taken in out of compassion. He carries with him a letter to the Queen."

The robbers seized the letter and read it, and under- stood that as soon as the youth arrived he was to be put to death. Then the robbers took compassion on him also, and th’e captain tore up the letter and wrote another, wherein he declared that the youth on his arrival was to be married to the Princess. They let him sleep quietly on his bench till the morning, and as soon as he awoke, they gave him the letter, and showed him the right road.

When the Queen received the letter, she did as it com- manded, and caused a splendid marriage-feast to be pre- pared, and the Princess was given in marriage to the luck- child, who, since he was both young and handsome, pleased her well, and they were all very happy. Some little time afterwards the King returned to his palace, and found the prophecy fulfilled, and his daughter married to the luck- child. " How did this happen ?" he asked. " In nry letter I gave quite another command."

Then the Queen handed him the letter, that he might read for himself what it stated. Then the King perceived that it had been forged by another person, and he asked the youth what he had done with the letter that had been entrusted to him, that he had brought another. " I know nothing about it," he replied; " it must have been changed in the forest where I passed the night."

Inflamed with rage, the King answered, " Thou shalt not escape so easily; he who would have my daughter must fetch for me three golden hairs from the head of the Giant ; bring thou to me what I desire, then shalt thou re- ceive my daughter."

The King hoped by this means to get rid of him, but he answered, " The three golden hairs I will fetch, for I fear not the Giant and so he took leave and began his wanderings.

The road led him by a large town, where the watch- man at the gate asked him what trade he understood, and what he knew. " I know every thing," replied the youth.

" Then you can do us a kindness," said the watch, " if you tell us the reason why the fountain in our market- place, out of which wine used to flow, now, all at once, does not even give water."

" That you shall know," was the answer ; " but you must wait till I return."

Then he went on further, and came to a rather large city ; where the watchman asked him, as before, what trade he understood, and what he knew. " I know every thing," he replied.

" Then you can do us a kindness, if you tell us the reason why a tree growing in our town, which used to bear golden apples, does not now even have any leaves."

" That you shall know," replied the youth, " if you wait till I return ;" and so saying, he went on farther till he came to a great lake, over which it was necessary that he should pass. The ferryman asked him what trade he understood, and what he knew. " I know every thing," he replied.

"Then," said. the ferryman, "you can do me a kind- ness if you tell me why, for ever and ever, I am obliged to row backwards and forwards, and am never to be released." " You shall learn the reason why," replied the youth ; " but wait till I return."

As soon as he got over the water he found the entrance into the Giant’s kingdom. It was black and gloomy, and the Giant was not at home ; but his old grandmother was sitting there in an immense arm-chair. " What do you want ?" said she, looking at him fixedly. " I want three golden hairs from the head of the King of these regions," replied the youth, " else I cannot obtain my bride." " That is a bold request," said the woman ; " for if he comes home and finds you here it will be a bad thing for you; but still you can remain, and I will see if I can help you."

Then she changed him into an ant, and told him to creep within the fold of her gown, where he would be quite safe.

"Yes," he said, "that is all very well; but there are three things I am desirous of knowing : — Why a fountain, which used to spout wine, is now dry, and does not even give water. — Why a tree, which used to bear golden apples, does not now have leaves. — And why a ferryman is always rowing backwards and forwards, and never gets released."

" Those are difficult questions," replied the old wo- man ; " but do_you keep quiet and pay attention to what the King says when I pluck each of the three golden hairs."

As soon as evening came the Giant returned; and scarcely had he entered, when he remarked that the air was not quite pure. " I smell, I smell the flesh of man," he exclaimed ; " all is not right." Then he peeped into every corner, and looked about, but could find nothing. Presently his old grandmother began to scold, screaming, "There now, just as I have dusted and put every thing in order, you are pulling them all about again : you are for ever having man’s flesh in your nose ! Sit down and eat your supper."

When he had finished he felt tired ; and the old woman took his head in her lap, and said she would comb his hair a bit. Presently he yawned ; then winked ; and at last snored. Then she plucked out a golden hair, and laid it down beside her.

"Bah !" cried the King, "what are you about?"

" I have had a bad dream," answered the old woman, "and so I plucked one of your hairs."

"What did you dream, then?" asked he.

" I dreamt that a market-fountain which used to spout wine is dried up, and does not even give water : what is the matter with it, pray?"

"Why, if you must know," answered he, "there sits a toad under a stone, 'in the spring, which, if any one kills, wine will gush out as before."

Then the old woman went on combing till he went to sleep again, and snored so that the windows shook. Pres- ently she pulled out a second hair.

"Confound it! what are you about?" exclaimed the King in a passion.

" Don’t be angry," said she ; " I did it in a dream."

" What did you dream this time ?" he asked.

" I dreamt that in a certain royal city there grew a fruit- tree, which formerly bore golden apples, but now has not a leaf upon it : what is the cause of it ?"

"Why," replied the King, "at the root a mouse is gnawing. But if they kill it, golden apples will grow again ; if not, the mouse will gnaw till the tree dies altogether. However, let me go to sleep in peace now; for if you disturb me again you will catch a box on the ears." Nevertheless, the old woman, when she had rocked him again to sleep, plucked out a third golden hair. Hp jumped the King in a fury, and would have ill-treated her, but she pacified him, and said, " Who can help bad dreams?"

" What did you dream this time ?" he asked, still curious to know.

" I dreamt of a ferryman who is for ever compelled to row backwards and forwards, and will never be released. What is the reason thereof?"

" Oh, you simpleton !" answered the Giant. " When one comes who wants to cross over, he must give the oar into his hand ; then will the other be obliged to go to and fro, and he will be free."

Now, since the old woman had plucked the three golden hairs, and had received answers to the three questions, she let the Giant lie in peace, and he slept on till daybreak.

As soon as he went out in the morning, the old woman took the ant out of the fold of her gown, and restored him again to his human form.

" There you have the three golden hairs from the King’s head, and what he replied to the three questions you have just heard."

" Yes, I have heard and will well remember," said the luck-child ; and, thanking the old woman for her assistance in his trouble, he left those regions, well pleased that he had been so lucky in every thing. When he came to the ferryman he had to give him the promised answer. But he said, " First row me over, and then I will tell you how you may be freed and as soon as they reached the op- posite side he gave him the advice, " When another comes this way and wants to pass over, give him the oar in his hand."

Then he went on to the first city, where stood the bar- ren tree, and where the watchman waited for the answer. So he said to him, " Kill the mouse which gnaws at the root of the tree, and then it will again bear golden apples." The watchman thanked him, and gave him for a reward two asses laden with gold, which followed him. Next he came to the other city, where the dry fountain was, and he told the watchman as the Giant had said, — " Under a stone in the spring there sits a toad, which you must uncover and kill, and then wine will flow again as before."

The watchman thanked him, and gave to him, as the other had done, two asses laden with gold.

Now the lucky youth soon reached home, and his dear bride was very glad when she saw him return, and heard how capitally every thing had gone with him. He brought the King what he had desired — the three golden hairs from the head of the Giant; and when his majesty saw the four asses laden with gold, he was quite pleased, and said, " Now are the conditions fulfilled, and you may have my daughter : but tell me, dear son-in-law, whence comes all this gold ? This is indeed bountiful treasure !"

" I was ferried over a river," he replied, " and there I picked it up, for it lies upon the shore like sand."

" Can I not fetch some as well?" asked the King, feel- ing quite covetous.

" As much as you like ; there is a ferryman who will row you across, and then you can fill your sacks on the other side."

The covetous King set out in great haste upon his jour- ney, and as soon as he came to the river beckoned to the ferryman to take him over. The man came and bade him step into his boat ; and as soon as they reached the opposite shore the ferryman put the oar into his hand, and sprang on shore himself.

So the King was obliged to take his place, and there he is obliged to row to and fro for ever, for his sins.

And there he still rows, for no one has yet come to take the oar from him.

No. 38. — The Three Golden Hairs of the Sun-King

A rich, mighty king once went hunting, and wandered himself in a great forest. Towards evening he came to a hut, in which lived a poor charcoal-burner. The king asked the poor man his way to the city.

The charcoal-burner answered, 'Sir, the way to the city you could not find by yourself, and to-day I cannot go with you for my wife lies sick, and this very night will bring a child into the world. Lie down here then in the side room, and to-morrow I will guide you to the city.'

The king took the offer, and lay down in the side room ; but he could not close an eye for the moaning of the char- coal-burner's wife. Towards midnight she bore a beautiful boy, and now it was quiet in the hut Yet still the king could not sleep. He got up from his couch, drew near the door, and looked through a chink into the room where the sick woman lay. He could see her sleeping in her bed ; her man, fast asleep too, lay behind the stove ; and in its cradle was the new-born child, with three ladies in white standing round it.

The king heard one say, ' I wish this boy a misfortune.'

The second said, ' And I grant him a means to turn this misfortune to good.'

The third said, ' I will bring to pass his marriage with the daughter of the king who is now in the next room. At this very moment his wife is bringing into the world a girl of marvellous beauty.'

Thereupon the three ladies departed ; and the king thought and thought how to destroy this boy. Early next morning the charcoal-burner came into the side room and said, weeping, to the king, ' My poor wife is dead. What can I do with the little child ? '

The king answered, quite rejoiced, ' I am the king, and will care for the child. Only show me the way to the city, and I will send one of my servants to fetch the child.'

And so it was. The charcoal-burner guided his king to the city and was richly rewarded ; and the king sent a servant back with secret instructions to fling the boy into the river and let him drown. When now the servant was returning from the forest with the child, he flung it, basket and all, into the river, and told the king, *Most gracious king, I have done as thou hast commanded me.' The king rewarded him, and went now to his wife, who the night before had borne a girl of marvellous beauty.

The basket with the boy went floating about a long time on the water, and at last was seen by a fisherman who drew it out, and took the child home to his wife. They both rejoiced greatly at the sight of this pretty boy ; and as they had no children they kept him and brought him up.

Twenty years went by ; and the boy, whom his parents called Nameless, grew up a wonderfully pretty lad. Once the king passed the fisherman's hut, and saw the fair youngster. He entered the hut and asked the fisherman, ' Is this pretty youngster your son ? '

* No,' said the fisherman, ' twenty years ago I fished him out of the water.'

Then the king was exceeding terrified, and said presently, ' I will write a letter to the queen, and this lad shall take it to her.'

So he wrote this letter : ' Dear wife, have this lad put forthwith to death, else he will undo us all.'

Nameless set out with the letter for the queen, but on his way to the city lost himself in a forest, and there met a lady in white who said to him, ' You have lost yourself. Come to my hut, and rest a bit ; then I '11 soon bring you to the queen.'

She led Nameless to her hut, and there he fell fast asleep. The old lady took the letter from his pocket, burnt it, and put another in its stead. When the lad awoke, to his great amazement he found himself in front of the king's house. So he went in to the queen and gave her the letter, in which stood written : ' Dear wife, at once call the pope, and let him plight this lad to our daughter. I wish him to marry her, else a great ill will befall us.'

The queen did as her husband, the king, desired. She bade call the pope, and Nameless and the king's fair daughter became man and wife. When the king came home and learnt of this wedding, he had the letter brought, and saw it was his own handwriting. Then he asked his son-in-law where he had been and whom he had spoken with; and when Nameless told him about the lady in white, the king knew that the fairy^ had aided him. Nameless was not at all the son-in-law he wanted, and he sought to make away with him, so said, 'Go into the world and fetch me three golden hairs from the head of the Sun-King, then shall you be king along with me.'

Sorrowfully Nameless set out, for he loved his young wife, and she too loved him dearly. As he wandered on he came to a great black lake, and saw a white boat floating on the water. He cried to the old man in it, *Boat ahoy! come and ferry me over.'

The old man answered, ' I will take you across if you '11 promise to bring me word how to escape out of this boat, for only then can I die.'

Nameless promised, and the old man ferried him over the black water. Soon after Nameless came to a great city, where an old man asked him, ' Whither away ? '

' To the Sun-King,' said Nameless.

' Couldn't be better. Come, I '11 bring you to our king, who '11 have something to say to you.'

The king, when Nameless stood before him, said, ' Twenty years ago there was in our city a spring whose water made every one that drank of it grow young. The spring has vanished, and only the Sun-King knows where it is gone to. You are journeying to him, so ask him where it is gone to, and bring us word.'

Nameless promised him to bring word on his return, and departed. Some days after he came to another city, and there another old man met him and asked, ' Whither away ?'

' To the Sun-King,' said Nameless.

'That 's capital. Come, I '11 bring you to our king, who '11 have something to say to you.'

When they came to the king, the king said, ' Twenty years ago a tree in this city bore golden apples ; whoso ate of those apples grew strong and healthy, and died not. But now for twenty years this tree has put forth no more fruit, and only the Sun-King knows the reason why. So when you come to him, ask him about it, and bring us word.'

Nameless promised him to bring word on his return, and departed. Some days after he reached a great mountain, and there saw an old lady in white sitting in front of a beautiful house. She asked him, ' Whither away ? '

' I seek the Sun-King', said Nameless.

' Come in then,' said the old lady. ' I am the mother of the Sun-King, who daily flies out of this house as a little child, at mid-day becomes a man, and returns of an evening a greybeard.'

She brought Nameless into the house, and made him tell her his story. He told her of the man on the black lake, of the spring, and of the tree that used to bear golden apples.

Then said the old lady, ' I will ask my son all about that But come, let me hide you ; for if my son finds you here he 'll burn you up.'

She hid Nameless in a great vessel of water, and bade him keep quiet. At evening the Sun-King came home, a feeble old man with golden head, and got victuals and drink from his mother. When he had eaten and drunk, he laid his golden head in his mother's lap and fell fast asleep. Then the old lady twitched out a golden hair, and he cried,"

' Mother, why won't you let me sleep ? '

The old lady .answered, ' I saw in a dream a city with a tree which used to bear golden apples, and whoso ate of them grew well and healthy, and died not. For twenty years now the tree has put forth no more fruit,_ and the people know not what they ought to do.'

The Sun-King said, 'They should kill the serpent that gnaws at the root of the tree.'

Again he slept, and after a while his mother twitched out a second hair. Then cried the Sun-King, ' Mother, what 's the meaning of this ? why can't you let me sleep ? '

The old lady answered, ' My dear son, I dreamed of a city with a spring, and whoso drank of it grew young again. Twenty years has this spring ceased to flow, and the people know not what they should do.'

The Sun-King said, ' A great toad is blocking the source of the spring. They should kill the toad, then the spring will flow as before.'

Again he slept, and after a while the old lady in white twitched out a third hair. Then cried the Sun-King,

' Mother, do let me sleep.'

The old lady answered, ' I saw in a dream a great black lake with an old man rowing about it in a boat, and he doesn't know how to escape from the boat, for only then can he die.'

The Sun-King said, ' Next time he takes any one over, let him hand him the oars and jump ashore himself ; then the other must stop in the boat, and the old man can die.'

Again he slept.

Early next morning the Sun-King arose as a lovely child, and flew out of the window. The old lady gave Nameless the three hairs and said, ' Now go to your wife, and give the king the three hairs. I have done for you all that at your birth I promised my sisters. And now farewell.'

She kissed Nameless, and led him outside, and he started off homewards. When he came to the city where the spring had ceased to flow, he told the people to kill the great toad that blocked up the source. They looked, found the toad, and killed it ; then the spring flowed again, and the king rewarded him richly. When Nameless came to the city where for twenty years the tree had ceased to bear golden apples, he told the people to kill the serpdnt that was gnawing the roots of the tree. The people dug down, found the serpent, and killed it. Then the tree again bore golden fruit, and the king rewarded him richly. When Nameless reached the black lake, the old man would not take him across. But Nameless said if he would he would tell him the secret then, so the old man took him across the black water. When he was out of the boat he told the old man to hand his oars to the next passenger and then jump ashore himself; so he would be free and at last could die, but the other would have to go rowing about on the lake.

Nameless soon got back home, and gave the king the three golden hairs ; his wife rejoiced greatly, but her father was beside himself for rage. But when Nameless told of the spring and the golden apples, the king cried quite delighted, ' I too must drink of this spring ; I too must eat of these golden apples.' He set out instantly, but when he reached the black lake, the old man handed him the oars and jumped ashore. And the king could not leave the boat, and had to stop there on the water. As he never came home, Nameless became king of the country, and lived henceforth with his beautiful bride in peace and prosperity.

Identical with Wratislaw's Bohemian story of ' The Three Golden Hairs of Grandfather Allknow ' (Sixty Slavonic Folk-tales, pp. 16-25), and with Grimm's No. 29, ' The Devil with the Three Golden Hairs ' (i. 1 19-125, 377-378), only the German tale opens defectively. Wlislocki's opening, however, meets us again in Bernhard Schmidt's ' Der Spruch der Moeren* {Griechische Mdrchen, No. 2, p. 67), where, as elsewhere, the part of the fairies is taken by the three Moirai or fates. The whole question of fairy mythology requires to be carefully re-studied in the light of our copious stock of Greek and Indian folk-tales, of which Leyden and Grimm could know nothing. In his Deutsche Mythologie (i. 382) Grimm expresses himself as in doubt whether y^/a came to mean ' fairies' owing to Celtic or to Teutonic influences; probably was a conscious translation of the Greek moirai^ and is an indication that the fairy mythology of Western Europe was largely, if not wholly, derived from Greek-speaking Levantine sources^

Wikipedia - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fish_and_the_Ring  
> An Irish variation is found in Tain Bo Fraich, in which Ailill gives his daughter Findabair a ring, which she then gives to her lover Fraech, who is hated by Ailill. Ailill discovers the ring among Fraech's things, and throws it into the river, where it is swallowed by a salmon. Fraech sees this, commands a servant to catch the salmon and cook it. When Ailill demands the ring, Findabair sends a servant to deliver the fish with the ring on top. Ailill demands that Fraech tell where the ring came from, and Fraech lies, saying he found it in the salmon and not before. Despite the lie, Fraech and Findabair are able to depart for their own lands.

TAIN BO FRAICH

The following text is taken from MS. XL, Advocates Library, Edinburgh, pp. 37-45.

A collateral version from the Book of Leinster was published by O'Beirne Crowe (in the Proc. R. Ir. Acad., Ir. MS. Ser., 1870); but this book is not now to be had.

Prof. Kuno Meyer has published the Egerton MS. version of this tale (Zeitschr. f. Celt. Phil. IV i. 1902^.32-47); and has at the same time given copious notes collating the different versions.

I have endeavoured to make the translation as literal as possible; and have given the text practically as it stands in the original MS., because there is occasional doubt as to where the sentences and speeches should be divided. Extensions of ail but the simplest contractions are italicised.

The notes are meant for elucidation of the present text only, or tor the suggestion of a more plausible reading. For comparison of the different versions, reference must be made to Prof. Kuno Meyer' s text and notes.

References in the notes to the Book of Leinster (LL.) are taken from the facsimile to the Egerton MS. (Eg.) from Prof. Kuno Meyer's transcription.

THE " REAVING OF FRAECH'S COWS " HERE

FRAECH, son of Idach of the Connaughtmen : a son he was to Befinn of the Side ; a full sister she to Boinn.

He is the hero that was most beauteous of the men of Erin and Albin, but he was not long-lived. His mother gave him twelve cows from the Sid-hill : they are white, with red ears. He dwelt to the end of eight years, with no wife given to him. Fifty king's sons was the number of his household, all of the same age and like to him both in form and in feature.

Finnabair, daughter of Oilill and Meadb, loved him, from the great reports about him. This was told to him at his house. Erin and Albin were full of his fame and of tales about him. After that he cast `[Going to a dialogue with the daughter fell upon him. Crowe.]` upon himself to go to speak with the maiden. He discussed this matter with his people. " Do thou send then " (said they), " to thy mother's sister, and let somewhat be given thee by her of wondrous clothing and of gifts of the Side ". Thereupon he went to (his mother's) sister, to Boinn, and came into Mag-Breg. And he took fifty blue mantles: and each was like unto a beetle's lustre `[Was like to the *findruine* of a work of art. Cr.]` ; and four dark-grey ears were upon each mantle : and with each mantle a brooch of ruddy gold. And fifty pure-white shirts, with clasps of gold and of silver upon them. And fifty shields of silver, with rims. And in the hand of each man a royal-palace candle `[i. e. a spear.]`, with fifty rivets of white bronze in each. Fifty rings of refined gold on each one. Butt-blades `[Pins of carbuncle under them (i. e. the shields) from beneath. Cr.]` of carbuncle on their lower ends, and of precious stones their heads. They blazed in the night as though they were rays of the sun. And fifty gold-hilted swords they took ; and for each man to sit upon, a soft grey horse, with a bit of gold. A band of silver with little bells of gold under the neck of each horse. Fifty purple caparisons, with silver fringes ont of them, with buckles of gold and of silver, and with head clasps `[With drops of gold and of silver, and with head-animals. Cr.]`. Fifty whips of white bronze with crooks of gold on the end of each one. And seven hounds in chains of silver, and an apple of gold between each of them. Shoes of bronze upon them. There was no colour that was not upon them. Seven horn-blowers with them, with horns of gold and of silver ; with robes of many colours, with golden locks, long and yellow, with shining cloaks. Three druids `[Jesters. Cr.]` were before them, with diadems of silver overlaid with gold. Shields with embossed emblems `[With a cover of embroidery. Cr.]` had each one, with dark crooks, with bars of bronze `[With black staffs with filigrees of bronze. Cr.]` along their sides. Three harpers, each with a kingly countenance.

They set out thereupon after this fashion for Cruachan. The watchman sees them from the castle when they have come to the plain of Cruachan. " I see a numerous company approaching the castle : since Oilill and Meadb took sovereignty, there came not ever, and there will not come, a finer or more brilliant company. I deem it the same as though in a vat of wine my head should be, with the (fragrant) breeze that goes over me. The feats and the practice `[The activity and the play. Cr.]` that the young man who is in it makes, I never saw their equal. He flings his javelin the length of a spear's cast from him; before it reaches the ground, the seven hounds in their seven chains of silver catch it. "

Upon that the hosts in the castle of Cruachan come forth to behold them : the folk crush one another in the castle; so that sixteen men died at seeing them.

They dismount in the door of the castle. They unbridle their horses and let loose their dogs. They hunt seven deer to the fort of Cruachan, and seven foxes, and seven beasts of the plain, and seven wild boars; and the youths killed them in the forecourt of the castle. After that the hounds leap into Brei. They seize seven otters. They carried them up into the door of the main-rampart.

There they sat down. Men come from the king to speak with them. It is asked of them whence they have come. Thereupon they name themselves after their true lineages. " Fraech son of Idach is here ", say they. The steward tells it to the king and queen. " Welcome to them ", say Oilill and Meadb. " He is a noble youth ", says Oilill; " let him come within the stronghold ". A quarter of the house is granted to them.

This is the fashion of the house: — seven rows ; seven rooms from fire to wall in the house ail round. A fronting `[A rail. Cr.]` of bronze upon each apartment ; woodwork (?) of red yew, all planed and mottled `[A partitioning of red yew, under variegated planeing all. Cr.]`. Three strips of bronze in the ceiling(?) `[The skirting. Cr.]` of each room : seven strips of copper from the ox-cauldron to the rooftree in the house. Of pine was the house made; it was a roof of shingles that was upon it outside. Sixteen windows were in the house, and a shutter of copper on each one. A yoke of copper `[A tie of brass. Cr.]` across the roof-light. Four corner-poles of copper ail ornamented with bronze upon the apartment of Oilill and Meadb, and it in the very centre of the house. Two frontings of silver about it, overlaid with gold. A rod of silver in the front reached the mid-timbers `[Girders. Cr.]` of the house ; they stretch round the house `[The house was encircled. Cr.]` all round from one door to the other.

They hang up their arms in that house; they sit, and welcome is given to them. " Welcome to them ", say Oilill and Meadb.

" It is that they have come for ", says Fraech.

" Let not this be a journey for strife " `[It shall not be a habitation for begging contention this. Cr.]` , says Meadb.

Meadb and Oilill play chess after that. Thereupon Fraech takes to playing chess with a man of his people. They were beautiful `[It was a beauty of a chessboard. Cr.]` , the chess things: a board of white bronze, with four ears and elbows of gold; a candle of precious stone giving light to them; gold and silver the men that were upon the board.

" Prepare ye food for the youths ", says Oilill.

" That is not what I wish ", says Meadb; " but to go to play chess yonder with Fraech ".

" Rise and do it, I deem it good ", says Oilill.

Thereupon she played chess with Fraech. His folk meanwhile were cooking the animals.

" Let thy harpers play to us ", says Oilill.

" Let them play indeed ", says Fraech.

A harp-bag of otterskins round the harps, with their bordering ot scarlet leather `[Adornment of ruby. Cr.]` under their adornment of gold and of silver. The skin of a roe about them in the middle : it was as white as snow ; dark grey spots in its centre. Linen cloths white as the swan's raiment about the strings. (The harps of gold and silver and white bronze, with figures of serpents and birds and dogs in gold and silver. Whenever those strings were touched), these figures thereupon ran about the men ail round.

Then they played to them ; so that twelve men of their household died of weeping and sadness.

Sweet and tuneful were these three ; and they were mellower even than Uaithne `[And they were the Chants of Uaithne. Cr.]`. The famous Three were three full brothers, Tear-bringer, Smile-bringer and Sleep-bringer by name. Boinn of the Side was the mother of the Three. It is from the music which Uaithne, harp of the Dagda, played, that the Three are named. When the woman was in child-birth, it wept for sorrow over the sharpness of the pangs at first. It was a smile and a laugh it played in the middle, for joy of the two sons. A sweet sleep it plays — the last son — for the heaviness of the birth. Whence was named the third part of music. Afterward Boinn awoke ont of the sleep. " I accept " said she, " thy three sons, Uaithne of perfect ardour, since there are Sleep-bringing and Smile-bringing and Tear-bringing upon cows and women who will go with Meadb and Oilill. Men shall die, who have an car for harmonies `[By the hearing of art from them. Cr.]` ".

They cease from the playing after that in the palace.

" Majestically it came `[It is rushing that has come. Cr.]` ", says Fergus.

" Distribute to us ", says Fraech, " the food ". They bring it in. Lothur steps on to the floor of the house : he distributes to them the food. Upon his palm `[On his haunches. Cr.]` he divided each joint with his sword, and there was not redistributed fell or flesh `[And he used not touch the eating of the meats. Cr.]`. Since he assumed dividing food was never wasted under his hand.

They were three days and three nights at the playing of chess, by (the light of) the multitude of precious stones in the company of Fraech. After that Fraech addresses Meadb : " Well have I won from thee `[It is well we have been entertained by thee. Cr.]` ", says he. " I take not thy stake from the chess ; let there be no loss of honour therein to thee `[That there be not a decay of hospitality for thee in it. Cr.]` ".

" From thy coming to this castle, this is the day which seems longest to me `[Since I am in the dun, this is the day which I deem quiet. Cr.]` ", says Meadb.

" That is not strange ", says Fraech, " three days and three nights are in it ".

Upon that Meadb rises ; she thought it shame that the youths should be without food. She goes to Oilill and tells it to him : " A great deed have we done ", says she, " the youths who have come to us from outside to be without food ".

" Thou preferrest playing chess ", says Oilill.

" It hinders not the distribution to his folk through the house. It is three days and three nights ", says she. " But we noted not the night, through the white light of the precious stones in the house ".

" Let them cease from their laments `[Chanting. Cr.]` (?) till distribution is made to them ". Thereupon distribution is made to them; and it was well with them ; and they continued three days and three nights at the feasting.

It is then that Fraech was bidden into the speech-house, and the question (put) to him `[It is asked of him. Cr.]` what had brought him.

" Pleasing to me " says he, " is a visit to you ".

" Truly not ill-pleasing to the household is your acquaintance ", says Oillil. " Your presence is better than your absence ".

" We will stay then ", says Fraech, " another week ".

After that they stay in the castle to the end of a fortnight; and each day they hunted towards the castle. The Connaughtmen came to see them.

Fraech was troubled that he had no speech with the maiden, for this was the purpose which brought him. One day he rises at the end of night to wash at the river. It is then that she too went with her maid to wash. He takes her hand. " Stay to speak with me ", says he. " It is thee we have come for ".

" It were truly welcome to me ", says the maiden, " if I could `[If I were to come.]` : I can do nothing for thee ".

" Tell me, wilt thou flee with me? " says he.

" Indeed I will not flee ", she says, " for I am the daughter of a king and queen. There is naught of thy display that I learn not from my people ; and it will be my choice to go to thee. Thee have I loved. And take thou with thee this

TO DO


thumb-ring ", says the maiden, " and it shall be as a token between us. My mother gave it to me ", she says, " to lay it by; and I will say that I have lost it ".

After that they part.

<( I fear o says Oilill, " the flight of yonder maiden with Fraech : though she would be given to him for a price, and (on condition) that lie would come to us with his beasts to help us at the Reaving. "

Fraech goes to them into the speecli-lioti.se. " Is it secret conference ye hold?" says Fraech.

" l thou wilt lit in it ", says Oilill.

" Will ye give to me your daughter ? " says Fraech.

The people look one upon another 1 .

" She shall be given ", says Oilill, " if a bride-gift be given as is asked. "

" It shall be thine ", says Fraech.

" I ask three score of dark grey horses ", says Oilill, " with their bits of gold; and twelve milch kine, each one of which gives milk (for fifty) to drink, and a white calf, red-eared, with each one ; and that thou comest with me, with ail thy host, and with thy musicians, to take the cows from Cuailne : and my daughter will be given to thee, provided that thou comest. "

" I swear by my shield, by my sword, by my war-gear, I would not give that as bride-gift even for Meadb ". He goes from them out of the house.

Thereupon Oilill and Meadb speak with one another. " It will incite against us many of the kings of Erin if he takes the maiden. What is best, let us go after him and slay him straightway, ere he bring destruction upon us. "

" Evil is that ", says Meadb, " and it is a dishonour to us. "

" It will be no dishonour to us ", says Oilill, " the way that I shall plan it. " Oilill and Meadb go into the palace.

" Let us go out ", says Oilill, " and see the hounds hunting till mid-day, and until they are tired. "

i. The hosts will clearly sce she shall be given. Cr.



Afterwards they ail go out to the river to bathe. " It is told to me ", says Oilill, " that thou art a good swimmer. Come into this pool and let us see thy swimming. "

" What of this pool ? " he says.

" We know no danger in it ", says Oilill. " Bathing in it is frequent. " Thereupon Fraech puts his clothing off him and goes into the pool, and Laves its belt above. Then Oilill opens Fraech's purse behind him, and the ring was in it. Oilill recognises it. " Corne O Meadb ! " says Oilill. Then Meadb comes. " Knowest thou that?" says Oilill. " I do ", she says. Oilill casts it down into the river.

Fraech noticed that thing; and saw this, that the salmon leapt to meet it and caught it in its mouth. He springs towards it and seizes its gill. He goes to the land, and brings it to a hidden place in the bank of the river. Then he proceeds to come out of the water.

" Come not ", says Oilill, " till thou bring me a branch from the rowan-tree yonder, on the bank of the river. Beautiful to my thinking are its berries. "

Thereupon he goes away, and breaks a branch from the tree, and takes it on his shoulder 1 into the water. This then was the saying of Finnabair: "A beautiful thing ye see 2 . " She thought it the more beautiful to see Fraech over a dark pool — the body of great whiteness, the hair of great beauty, the face of comeliness, the eve of grey ; and he a lissome youth, without fault or blemish; his face narrow below, broad above, and he straight-limbed and flawless : the branch with the red berries between his white throat and face. It is this that Finnabair said : " I have seen nothing that would approach him halfor third part for shapeliness ".

After that he flung to them the branches out of the water.

" Splendid and beautiful are the berries; bring us more of them. " He goes out again into the middle of the water. The Beast seizes him in the water. " Bring me a sword > ", says

he. And there was no man upon the shore who dared to give it to him through fear of Oilill and of Meadb. Upon that Finnabair throws off her clothing, and springs with the sword into the water. Mer father casts a five-pointed spear the length of a spear' s throw down, and it goes through her two tresses; and Fraech caught the spear in lus hand. He leaps up over the spear ashore `[]` , with the Beast still in his side. He hurls the spear with the prowess of weapon-wielding tribes `[]` , so that it goes through the purple robe and through the shirt that was on Oilill. Upon that the young men gather round Oilill. Finnabair comes out of the water, and leaves the sword in the hand of Fraech : and he smote the head from the Beast, so that it remained on his side; and he brought the Beast with him to land. It is from tins is named the " Black Linn of Fraech ", in Brei, in the lands of Connaught.

Thereupon Oilill and Meadb go into their castle. " A great deed have we done ", says Meadb. " We regret ", says Oilill, " what we have done to the man. As for the maiden ", says he, " she shall die to-morrow night, and it shall not be the fault of taking the sword that will be (ascribed) to her. Make ye a bath for tins man, a broth of fresh fat, and cow's flesh minced by adze and by axe ; and bring him into the bath ". Ail was done as to that thing even as he said.

Fraech's horn-blowers go before him into the castle. They play so that thirty men of the special friends of Oilill die of the melody `[Die for pleasurableness. Cr.]`. Thereupon he goes into the castle and enters the bath. The women-folk gather round him at the vat to chafe him `[For ablution and for washing of his head. Cr.]` and to wash his head.

Then he was taken out and a bed was laid for him. And they heard something, a wailing upon Cruachan. Thrice fifty women were seen, with purple tunics, with green headgear, with silver bracelets upon their wrists. Messengers go

to them to learn the tale of wherefore they lamented. " Fraech, son of ldach ", says the woman. " the favourite son " says the woman, " of the King of the Side of Erin ". With that Fraech hears the wailing. " Lift me out ", says he to his folk; " this is the weeping of my mother ", says he, " and of the women of Boinn. " Upon that he is lifted out and carried to them. The women come round him and carry him away into Cruachan.

At noues on the morrow, this is what they saw: — he comes, quite whole, without hurt or blemish, with fifty women around him — - alike in âge, in aspect, in beauty, in sweetness, in size and in form, with features of women of the Side, so that there was no recognising of one from another of them. Folk were well-nigh smothered (in the crush) around them.

They parted in the door of the stronghold. They give forth their weeping as they go from him, so that they distracted the people in the stronghold. It is hence comes the " Wailing of the Women of the Side ", of the musicians of Erin.

Thereupon he goes into the castle. Ail the folk rise to meet him, and give him welcome as though it were from another world he came. Oilill rises, and Meadb ; they make apology to him for the hurt they had caused him 1 , and they make peace.

They take to feasting in the evening 2 . Fraech calls a lad of his company : " Go out " says he, " to the place where I went into the water. I left a salmon there. Take it to Finnahair. Let her charge herself with the care of it. Let the salmon be well cooked by her: the ring is inside the salmon. I think it likely that it will be asked of her tonight?. " Wine-mirth seized them, and music and play delight them.

Then Oilill spoke : " Bring to me all my jewels ", said he. They were brought to him, and lay in front of him. " Won-

drous, wondrous! " says everyone. " Cal] to me Finnabair ", says he. Finnabair comes to them, with lîfty maidens around her.

" O daughter ", says Oilill, " the ring which I gave to thee last year, hast thou it yet? Bring it to me, that the young men may sec it. Thou shalt have it afterwards. "

" I know not ", she says, " what was done with it. "

" Find ont, forsooth ", says Oilill. " It is needful to seek it, or for thy life to go out from thy body. "

" That is not fitting ", say the youths; " there is much that is good here already. "

" There is not one of my jewels that shall not go for the maiden's sake ", says Fraech, " because she brought the sword to me in pledge of my life. "

" Thou hast naught amongst thy jewels that will help thee, if the ring come not from her ", says Oilill.

" I have not the power to give it ", says the maiden. " Do with me as thou wishest. "

" I swear by the God my tribe swears by 1 , thou shalt die 2 , if it come not from thee ", says Oilill. " It is for this that it is sought of thee, because it is difficult. For I know that until the men who have died from the beginning of the world come again, it comes not out of the place into which it was cast. "

" Well, it will not come for treasure or longing ", says the maiden, " the jewel which is asked for. — Let me go that I may bring it, since it is often that it is asked for ".

" Thou shalt not go ", says Oilill, " but let some one go from us to fetch it. "

Finnabair sends her maid to fetch it. " I swear by the God my people swears by, if it be found, I will be under thy power no longer, even it for saroli be my occupation. "

" I shall not hinder thee, though it were to the groom thou shouldst go, if the ring be found ", says Oilill.



1. I swear the oath my territory swears. Cr.

2. Thy flesh shall perish. Cr. Literally : thy lips shall die.

3. Though I should be at great drinking continually. Cr. !



Thereupon the maid brought the plate into the palace, and upon it the salmon, cooked, and dressed with honey; it was well prepared by the maiden; and below upon the salmon was the ring of gold. Oilill saw it, and Meadb. Afterward they look upon Fraech 1 ; and he looked at his purse.

" Me thinks it is testified 2 that I left off my belt ", says Fraech. " By the truth of thy Kingship ", says Fraech, " tell what thou didst with the ring. "

a That shall not be hidden ", says Oilill. " Mine is the ring thou hadst in thy purse. I know it is Finnabair who gave it to thee. It is therefore that I cast it into the deep pool. By the truth of thy honour and thy life, O Fraech, tell after what fashion was accomplished the bringing of it out. "

" It shall not be hidden from thee ", says Fraech. " The very day I found the ring in the door of the stronghold, I knew that it was a precious jewel. It is for this that I laid it by heedfully in my purse. I heard, the day that I went to hte water, the maiden who had lost it seeking for it. I said to her, " What reward wilt thou give me for finding it? " She said to me, she would give a year's love to me. It chanced that I had not brought it with me : I had left it behind in my house. We met not (till we met) at the giving of the sword into my hand in the river. After that I saw when thou didst open the purse, and didst cast the ring into the water. I saw the salmon which leapt to meet it and caught it in its mouth. Thereupon I caught the salmon, put it up in the mande, and sent it into the hand of the maiden. And it is that salmon which is on the plate. "

The bewilderment and the surprise of these tales occupy the household. " I shall not set my mind upon another youth in Erin after thee ", says Finnabair.

" Pledge thy self to it and come to us ", say Oilill and Meadb, " with thy cows to the Cattle-reaving from Cuailne: and when thou comest again from the East with thy cows, then shall ye wed that very night, thou and Finnabair. "



\. After that Fraech looks at it. Cr.

2. Methinks it is for proof I left my girdle. Cr.



" I will do that thing ", says Fraech. After that they abide there till the morrow.

Fraech makes ready with his folk, and they bid farewell to Oilill and to Meadb. Then they depart to his lands.

It chanced that meanwhile his cows had been stolen. His mother came to him : " Not fortunate ' thy journey " says she, " which has been made. It will cause great harm to thee. The cows have been stolen, and thy three sons, and thy wife, and are at the Range of the Alps. Three of them are in Northern Albin with the Picts. "

" Tell me, what shall I do ? " says he to his mother.

" Thou shalt not go to look for them. Thou wilt not give thy life for them ", she says. " Thou shalt have other cows from me. "

" Not thus is it ", says he ; " It lies upon my honour and upon my life to go with my cows to Oilill and Meadb for the reaving of the cows from Cuailne ".

" What thou seekest ", says his mother, " will not be attained. " And with that she goes from him.

Thereupon he sets off with thrice nine men, and a hawk and a leash-hound with them; till he came into the land of Ulster, and met with Conall Cearnach at the mountains of Boirche. He tells his difficulty to him.

" Not fortunate for thee ", says that one, " will be the thing (which is upon thee). A sore trouble is upon thee 2 ", says he ; " what is thy purpose in it ? "

" Thou wilt help me 3 ", says Fraech, " and go with me whatever time we meet. "

" Yea, I will go, " says Conall Cearnach.

They set out, the three 4 of them, over the sea, across the North of England, across the Sea of Icht, to the North of Lombardy, till they came to the Mountains of Alps. They saw in front of them a girl herding sheep. " Let us two go, O Fraech ", says Conall " and let us speak with the woman

yonder; and let our youths stay here ". Thereupon they went to speak with her. She said, " Whence are ye ? " " Of the men of Erin ", says Conall.

" Not fortunate truly for men of Erin is their coming to this land. Of the folk of Erin is my mother. "

" Thou wilt help me for friendship's sake. Tell us something of our wanderings. What kind of land have we come to ? "

" A grim and fearful land, with fierce youths, who go ono every side to take cattle and women and raiment `[Captives. Cr.]` ", says she.

" What is the last thing they have taken ? " says Fraech.

" The cows of Fraech, son of Idach, from the West of Erin; and his wife, and his three sons. His wife is here with the king. There are his cows, in the land before you. "

" Thou wilt come to our aid ", says Conall.

" Little is my power save knowledge of the woman `[LL : save knowledge only.]` . "

" This is Fraech ", says Conall, " and they are his cows that were taken. "

" Do ye think the woman faithful ? " she says.

" Though we thought her faithful when she went, yet we think her not faithful since she came. "

" The woman who tends the cows, go ye to her. Tell her your need. Of the people of Erin her race, of the Ulster-folk in special. "

They go to her; they accost (?) `[They receive her. Cr.]` her, and tell her their race : and she gives them welcome.

" What has brought you ? ", says she.

" Trouble has brought us ", says Conall. " Ours are the cows and the woman who is in the stronghold. "

" It will not be fortunate for you, in sooth ", says she, " to go against the woman. Harder for you than ail else ", says she, " is the serpent which guards the stronghold. "

" Name me not `[She is not my country name. Cr.]`", says Fraech. " I think her not faithful. I think thou art faithful. We know that thou wilt not deceive us, since thou art of the Ulster-folk. "

" Who of the Ulstermen are ye? " says she.

" Hère is Conall Cearnach, the best warrior among the Ulstermen ", says Fraech. She throws two hands upon the neck of Conall Cearnach. " The Destruction will arrive this time `[Has come in this expedition. Cr.]` ", says she, " seeing that he has come, for it is to him was prophesied the destruction ot this castle. Let me go hence ", says she. " I shall not be at the milking of the cows. I shall leave the stronghold with open gate : it is I who fasten it. I shall say that the calves were sucking `[It is for drink the calves were sucking. Cr.]` . Ye may come into the castle, if but they are asleep `[Come thou into the dun when they are sleeping. Cr.]`. Most grievous for you is the serpent which is at the castle ; many hosts are destroyed by it `[Several tribes are let loose from it (i.e. of serpents). Cr.]`. " " Thus shall we go ", says Conall.

They go against the stronghold. The serpent springs into the belt of Conall Cearnach, and they pillage the castle straightway. Thereupon they rescue the wife and the three sons, and take what is best of the jewels of the castle. And Conall looses the serpent out of bis belt, and neither of them did harm to the other.

And they go into the realm of the Northern Picts, so that he takes from there three of their cows.

And they went to the castle of Ollach mac Briuin, into Aird hUa n-Eachdach. It is there that Conall Cearnach's man died, while driving the cows: Biccne son of Laegaire by name. It is from this comes " Inber mBiccne ", at Bennchur. And they brought their cows across from there. It is there they cast their horns from them; so that from this comes " Tracht mBeannchuir. "

Thereupon Fraech departed to his land, and bis sons and his wife and his cows with him : so that he went with Oilill and Meadb to the Reaving of the Cows from Cuailne.

THE END. Amen.

INTRODUCTION

The Tain bo Fraich, the Driving of the Cattle of Fraech, has apparently only one version; the different manuscripts which contain it differing in very small points ; most of which seem to be due to scribal errors.

Practically the tale consists of two quite separate parts. The first, the longer portion, gives the adventures of Fraech at the court of Ailill and Maev of Connaught, his courtship of their daughter, Finnabar, and closes with a promised betrothal. The second part is an account of an expedition undertaken by Fraech to the Alps " in the north of the land of the Long-Beards," to recover stolen cattle, as well as "his wife," who is stated by O'Beirne Crowe, on the authority of the " Courtship of Trehla'ad " in the Book of Fermoy, to have been Trebland, a semi-deity, like Fraech himself. Except that Fraech is the chief actor in both parts, and that there is one short reference at the end of the second part to the fact that Fraech did, as he had promised in the first part, join Ailill and Maev upon the War of Cualnge, there is no connection between the two stories. But the difference between the two parts is not only in the subject-matter; the difference in the style is even yet more apparent. The first part has, I think, the most complicated plot of any Irish romance, it abounds in brilliant descriptions, and, although the original is in prose, it is, in feeling, highly poetic. The second part resembles in its simplicity and rapid action the other " fore-tales " or preludes to the War of Cualnge contained in this volume, and is of a style represented in English by the narrative ballad.

In spite of the various characters of the two parts, the story seems to have been regarded as one in all the manuscripts which contain it ; and the question how these two romances came to be regarded as one story becomes interesting. The natural hypothesis would be that the last part was the original version, which was in its earlier part re-written by a man of genius, possibly drawing his plot from some brief statement that Finnabar was promised to Fraech in return for the help that he and his recovered cattle could give in the Great War; but a difficulty, which prevents us from regarding the second part as an original legend, at once comes in. The second part of the story happens to contain so many references to nations outside Ireland that its date can be pretty well fixed. Fraech and his companions go over the sea from Ulster, i.e. to Scotland; then through " north Saxon-land " to the sea of Icht (i.e. the sea of Wight or the English Channel) ; then to the Alps in the north of the land of the Long-Beards, or Lombards. The Long-Beards do not appear in Italy until the end of the sixth century ; the suggestion of North Saxon-Land reaching down to the sea of Wight suggests that there was then a South Saxon-Land, familiar to an Irish writer, dating this part of the story as before the end of the eighth century, when both Saxons and Long-Beards were overcome by Charlemagne. The second part of the story is, then, no original legend, but belongs to the seventh or eighth century, or the classical period; and it looks as if there were two writers, one of whom, like the author of the Egerton version of Etain, embellished the love-story part of the original legend, leaving the end alone, while another author wrote an account of the legendary journey of the demi-god Fraech in search for his stolen cattle, adding the geographical and historical knowledge of his time. The whole was then put together, like the two parts of the Etain story; the difference between the two stories in the matter of the wife does not seem to have troubled the compilers.

The oldest manuscript authority for the Tain bo Fraich is the Book of Leinster, written before 1150. There are at least two other manuscript authorities, one in Egerton, 1782 (published by Professor Kuno Meyer in the Zeitschrift fur Celt Philologie, 1902); the other is in MS. XL., Advocates' Library, Edinburgh (published in the Revue Celtique, Vol. XXIV.). Professor Meyer has kindly allowed me to copy his comparison of these manuscripts and his revision of O'Beirne Crowe's translation of the Book of Leinster text. The text of the literal translation given here follows, however, in the main O'Beirne Crowe's translation, which is in the Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy for 1870; a few insertions are made from the other MSS.; when so made the insertion is indicated by a note.

For those who may be interested in the subsequent history of Fraech, it may be mentioned that he was one of the first of the Connaught champions to be slain by Cuchulain in the war of Cualnge; see Miss Faraday's translation (*Grimm Library*, page 35).
