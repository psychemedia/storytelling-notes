# Steampunk Festival

60 mins.

Steampunk philosphy, eg according to https://steampunkengine.net/steampunks-reflection-on-victorian-morals-and-ethics/

- "retrofuturisitc aesthetic"
- gender roles, class structures moral dilemmas
- nostalgia and regret, "a world that never was, a mechanical marvel inspired by the aesthetics of the Victorian era", "a perceived "lost" mechanical world"; "regret for the colonial attitudes and patriarchal values"
= "Bricolage is the art of constructing something new from a range of available materials, while detournement involves subverting and repurposing existing elements to create a new meaning or message"

What was the response of the people to all the mechanisation going in, in the steampunk driven cities? Imagine forking timelines, of our world and the steampubk workd. In the countryside, the rural poor continue to tell stories, stories the age of reason would show contempt for, as being naive, or "savage". What stories would the folklorisits from the steampunk world, and from our world, have found and collected in common?

Pondering this as a conceit for finding what stories to tell: What stories would the folklorisits from the steampunk world, and from our world, have found and collected in common?

Becuase the mechanisation of the steampunk world would have left behinds its own rural hinterland, or see the old ways rural landscapes transformed by the steampubk mechanisation

Just starting to sketch some notes out for my set now that's in accord with Steampunk philosophy. Eg Wish Ring (as you requested, everyday magic:-), then considering possibles variously from a sin-eater tale (1850s-70s, fakelore vs age of reason; https://psychemedia.github.io/sin-eater-resources/_beginning.html ), a brief tale relating to the "invention of modern time" ( https://psychemedia.github.io/storytelling-notes/too_much_time.html ), or maybe death penalty for forging the ace of spades (https://psychemedia.github.io/ace-of-spades-devilish-tales/reaffirming_the_law.html ), a tale of 1817 rebellion (with a reference back to 1812 machine breakers/Luddites, and ending with last time anyone sentenced in England to hanging, drawing and quartering (they relaxed actual sentence to a beheading after being hanged till dead);  power of the hanged man (hand of glory https://psychemedia.github.io/storytelling-notes/hand-of-glory.html ), maybe something about den of vice that was 1850s Newport ( https://psychemedia.github.io/island-storynotes/carus-wilson/25-pittis-libel.html ); maybe something from Ross-on-Wye ( https://github.com/psychemedia/storytelling-notes/blob/main/ross_on_wye.md#who-killed-the-bears or https://github.com/psychemedia/storytelling-notes/blob/main/ross_on_wye.md#old-ellen-may-hill-sensation-and-the-last-witch-of-ross-on-wye ); or at a push perhaps Bridget Cleary/changelings?

Lots of possible lines.... as well as others e.g. naval mutiny off Ryde https://psychemedia.github.io/island-storynotes/spithead_mutiny.html, or press gangs  https://psychemedia.github.io/storytelling-notes/press_gang.html but I maybe need to shape those more to a "naval" set in some other context;

I did also start pondering a Sandown/Bembridge 1870s set a couple of years ago - sinking of Eurydice (a legacy masted sailing training ship as the navy was moving to steam), which sank in Sandown Bay at time Sandown pier was being built, Brading march was being reclaimed etc etc. But both of those are very historical based and things which need an appropriate delivery context and lots of work!
