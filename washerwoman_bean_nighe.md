THE BEAN NIGHE, OR WASHING WOMAN.

At times the Fairy woman (*Bean shìth*) is seen in lonely places, beside a pool or stream, washing the linen of those soon to die, and folding and beating it with her hands on a stone in the middle of the water. She is then known as the *Bean-nighe*, or washing woman; and her being seen is a sure sign that death is near.

In Mull and Tiree she is said to have praeternaturally long breasts, which are in the way as she stoops at her washing. She throws them over her shoulders, and they hang down her back. Whoever sees her must not turn away, but steal up behind and endeavour to approach her unawares. When he is near enough he is to catch one of her breasts, and, putting it to his mouth, call herself to witness that she is his first nursing or foster-mother (*muime cìche*). She answers that he has need of that being the case, and will then communicate whatever knowledge he desires. If she says the shirt she is washing is that of an enemy he allows the washing to go on, and that man's death follows; if it be that of her captor or any of his friends, she is put a stop to.

In Skye the Bean-nighe is said to be squat in figure (*tiughiosal*), or not unlike a 'small pitiful child' (*paisde beag brònach*). If a person caught her she told all that would befall him in after life. She answered all his questions, but he must answer hers. Men did not like to tell what she said. Women dying in childbed were looked upon as dying prematurely, and it was believed that unless all the clothes left by them were washed they would have to wash them themselves till the natural period of their death. It was women 'dreeing this weird' who were the washing women. If the person hearing them at work beating their clothes (*slacartaich*) caught them before being observed, he could not be heard by them; but if they saw him first, he lost the power of his limbs (*lùgh*)

In the highlands of Perthshire the washing woman is represented as small and round, and dressed in prettygreen. She spreads by moonlight the linen winding sheets of those soon to die, and is caught by getting between her and the stream.

She can also be caught and mastered and made to communicate her information at the point of the sword. Oscar, son of the poet Ossian, met her on his way to the Cairbre's feast, at which the dispute arose which led to his death. She was encountered by Hugh of the Little Head on the evening before his last .battle, and left him as her parting gift (*fàgail*), that he should become the frightful apparition he did after death, the most celebrated in the West Highlands.

Considerably allied to the fairies is another species of supposed aerial beings, called by the Welsh knockers. These the Welsh miners say are heard underground, in or near mines, and by their noises generally point out to the workmen a rich vein of ore. The following are extracts from two letters on this extraordinary subject, written in the year 1754 by Mr. Lewis Morris, (a man eminent for his learning and good sense), to his brother, who at that time resided at Holyhead.

"People who know very little of arts or sciences, or the powers of nature, (which, in other words, are the powers of the Author of nature,) will laugh at us Cardiganshire miners, who maintain the existence of knockers in mines, a kind of good-natured impalpable people, not to be seen, but heard, and who seem to us to work in the mines; that is to say, they are the types, or forerunners of working in mines, as dreams are of some accidents which happen to us. The barometer falls before rain or storms. If we did not know the construction of it, we should call it a kind of dream, that foretells rain; but we know it is natural, and produced by natural means comprehended by us. Now how are we sure, or any body sure, but that our dreams are produced by the same natural means? There is some faint resemblance of this in the sense of hearing; the bird

is killed before we hear the report of the gun. However this is, / must speak well of the knockers, for they have actually stood my very good friends, whether they are aerial beings, called spirits, or whether they are a people made of matter, not to be felt by our gross bodies, as air and fire, and the like.

"Before the discovery of Esgair y Mwyn mine, these little people, as we call them here, worked hard there day and night; and there are abundance of honest, sober people, who have heard them, and some persons who have no notion of them, or of mines either; but after the discovery of the great ore they were heard no more.

"When I began to work at Llwyn Llwyd, they worked so fresh there for a considerable time, that they frightened some young workmen out of the work. This was when we were driving levels, and before we had got any ore; but when we came to the ore they then gave over, and I heard no more talk of them.

"Our old miners are no more concerned at hearing them blasting, boring holes, landing deads, &c. than if they were some of their own people; and a single miner will stay in the work, in the dead of the night, without any man near him, and never think of any fear or of any harm they will do him. The miners have a notion that the knockers are of their own tribe and profession, and are a harmless people who mean well. Three or four miners together shall hear them sometimes, but if the miners stop to take notice of them, the knockers will also stop; but let the miners go on at their own work, suppose it is boring, the knockers will at the same time go on as brisk as can be in landing, blasting, or beating down the loose; and they are always heard a little distance from them before they come to the ore.

"These are odd assertions, but they are certainly facts, though we cannot, and do not pretend to account for them. We have now very good ore at Llwyn Llwyd, where the knockers were heard to work, but have now yielded up the place, and are no more heard. Let who will laugh, we have the greatest reason to rejoice, and thank the knockers, or rather God, who sends us these notices."

The second letter is as follows:

"I have no time to answer your objection against knockers; I have a large treatise collected on that head, and what Mr. Derham says is nothing to the purpose. If sounds of voices, whispers, blasts, working or pumping, can be carried on a mile underground, they should always be heard in the same place, and under the same advantages, and not once in a month, a year, or two years. Just before the discovery of ore last week, three men together, in our work of Llwyn Llwyd, were ear- witnesses of knockers pumping, driving a wheelbarrow, &c.; but there is no pump in the work, nor any mine within less than a mile of it, in which there are pumps constantly going. If they were these pumps that they heard, why were they never heard but that once in the space of a year? And why are they not now heard? But the pumps make so little noise, that they cannot be heard in the other end of Esgair y Mioyn mine when they are at work.

"We have a dumb and deaf tailor in this neighbourhood, who has a particular language of his own by signs; and by practice I can understand him, and make him understand me pretty well; and I am sure I could make him learn to write, and be understood by letters very soon, for he can distinguish men already by the letters of their names. Now letters are marks to convey ideas, just after the same manner as the motions of fingers, hands, eyes, &c. If this man had really seen ore in the bottom of a sink of water in a mine, and wanted to tell me how to come at it, he would take two sticks like a pumpy and would make the motions of a pumper at the very sink where he knew the ore was; and would make the motions of driving a wheelbarrow. And what I should infer from thence would be, that I ought to take out the water and sink, or drive in the place, and wheel the stuff out. By parity of reasoning, the language of the knockers, by imitating the sound of pumping, wheeling, &c. signifies that we should take out the water, and drive there. This is the opinion of all old miners, who pretend to understand the language of the knockers. Our agent and manager, upon the strength of this notice, goes on and expects great things. You, and every body that is not convinced of the being of knockers, will laugh at these things, for they sound like dreams; so does every dark science. Can you make any illiterate man believe that it is possible to know the distance of two places by looking at them? Human knowledge is but of small extent, its bounds are within our view, we see nothing beyond these; the great universal creation contains powers, &c. that we cannot so much as guess at. May there not exist beings, and vast powers, infinitely smaller than the particles of air, to whom air is as hard a body as a diamond is to us? Why not? There is neither great nor small, but by comparison. Our knockers are some of these powers, the guardians of mines.

"You remember the story in Selden's Table-Talk, of Sir Robert Cotton and others disputing about Moses's shoe. Lady Cotton came in, and asked, ( Gentlemen, are you sure it is a shoe?' So the first thing is to convince mankind that there is a set of creatures, a degree or so finer than we are, to whom we have given the name of knockers, from the sounds we hear in our mines. This is to be done by a collection of their actions well attested; and that is what I have begun to do, and then let every one judge for himself."

These letters are curious, though the reasoning is far from conclusive
