# Sir Gawain and the Carle of Carlisle

A story I came across by chance whilst I was looking for Arthurian tales, but it also hit the "giant" requirement that was also on a list of tale topics I needed to find stories for. I don't recall ever having heard this tale told before, although I do remember a couple of years 15-20 years or so ago when Arthurian tales were very popular whenever we went to a storytelling event.

Telling this tale without some adaptation may cause some tricky moments when it comes to the scenes featuring the Carle's wife an daughter...

pp108-9

108 ARTHUR OF ALBION

... Arthur and his knights go hunting, and Bishop Baldwin, Kay and Gawain pursue a deer by themselves, and lose their way. They come to the castle of the Carl of Carlisle, of which, Baldwin tells them, it is said that no man ever stayed there and escaped with his life. None the less, they enter, and meet the Carl, a hideous giant who keeps four pets in his hall—a bear, a boar, a bull and a lion. Gawain is always courteous and obedient to his host, while the others break all the rules of good conduct. He is asked by the Carl to throw a spear at him, which he obediently does; the Carl dodges the missile, and then, leading Gawain to his wife’s chamber, puts him in her bed and bids him kiss her three times, but no more. He then leads him to his daughter, with whom he spends the night. The next morning the Carl bids Gawain cut off his head, which the latter reluctantly does; whereupon the Carl changes into an ordinary man, and tells Gawain that he has been under a spell which forced him to act thus until a knight obeyed all his commands, those who failed to do so being killed by him and his ‘pets’. Gawain weds the Carl’s daughter and they return to court, where the Carl is made a knight of the Round Table.

This romance, in its earlier form 660 verses in length, comes from the same district as The Turk and Gawain. It seems to be a direct translation of some Irish or Celtic story, and there is little evidence of any French version having been used. The closest parallel yet found is the Irish Curoz’s Castle, in which the giant has similarly four beasts, the accompanying knights fail the test, and the hero obeys an order to hurl a spear at the giant.!2 A story similar to the incident of the host’s daughter is found in Norse saga, but the connection is only slight.18

Apart from the disenchantment, the framework of the romance is an example of the Imperious Host motif found in every European folklore. Anyone arriving at the host’s castle who does not implicitly obey his word, even if politeness would seem to require disobedience, is automatically killed. This trial would be an obvious qualifying test for the disenchantment by decapitation, which can only be performed by the bravest of knights. So, in spite of wide superficial variations The Turk and Gawain and Sir Gawain and the Carl of Carlisle are in fact two forms of the same theme.

Syr Gawayne; a collection of ancient romance-poems, by Scotish and English authors, relating to that celebrated Knight of the Round Table, with an introduction, notes, and a glossary

NOTES p. 344-

THIS romantic tale is here printed for the first time from an unique copy discovered in one of the MSS. of the Porkington Library, No. 10, belonging to William Ormsby Gore, Esq., M.P., written at the close of the reign of Henry the Sixth. It is more particularly interesting from its being the original from which the modernised copy in the Percy MS. was taken. The question, therefore, of the genuineness and antiquity of the romance-poems (as distinguished from the longer and better known romances,) in this celebrated MS. would seem to be decided, for as *two* of these poems, namely, *The Grene Knight* and *The Carle of Carlile*, have been preserved in MSS. of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, it is not too much to suppose, that the rest of the tales in the volume of a similar description, although written at so late a period as the latter half of the seventeenth century were derived from ancient texts, which may yet be lurking in the unexplored treasures of some cathedral, collegiate, or private library.

The original of this story must be sought for in the literature of the continent, and we find it in the beautiful fabliau of *Le Chevalier à L'Epée*, printed in Meon's *Recueil*, tome i. p. 127, 8vo, 1823, and previously analysed by Le Grand. Both works are so well known as to render any repetition of it here unnecessary.

Carle off Carlyle `[A curious Song of the Marriage of Sir Gawane, one of King Arthur's Knights.— P.]`:

THIS poem was printed from the Folio by Sir F. Madden in the Appendix to his *Syr Gawayne* for the Bannatyne Club, pp. 256-74. Some of his readings of the MS. differ from mine; and though, if I can trust my eyes, the MS. does not make all the mistakes that Sir F. Madden attributes to it, I have thought it only due to his well-established reputation and great experience in reading MSS., as well as to our readers, who will probably trust him rather than me, to put his readings in the notes. The poem is, as he says, a modernised copy of the *Syre Gawene and the Carle of Carelyle* in the Porkington MS. No. 10, " written in the reign of Edward IV.," printed by him (Sir F. Madden) in the Appendix to his *Syr Gawayne*, pp. 187-206. Though Mrs. Ormsby Gore has kindly lent me this Porkington MS., I have not collated the Folio with it, as its *Syre Gawene* will be printed by Mr. Richard Morris for the Early English Text Society next year, and will there be easily accessible to all readers. The alterations are great in words, small in incidents, and the earlier poem is the better one. Sir F. Madden looks on the occurrence of the present poem and *The Grene Knight* (vol. ii. p. 58) in our Folio as settling the " question of the genuineness and antiquity of the romance-poems (as distinguished from the longer and bettor-known romances) in this celebrated MS." — that is, that the Folio poems are not abstracts made of the old romances in the seventeenth century, but retellings or adaptations of abstracts made in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. " The original of this story must be sought for in the literature of the Continent, and we find it in the beautiful *fabliau of Le Chevalier à l'Epée*, printed in Meon's *Recueil*, tome i. p. 127, 8vo, 1823, and pre viously analysed by Le Grand. "

Like the other Gawaine stories in the Folio, this one takes us into weirdland, the region where necromancers have been at work, where Kelts loved specially to range. And, as in *The Turks and Gawin* and *The Marriage of Sir Gawaine*, the counter charm which undoes the fiendly work is Gawaine's courtesy. Though he was not held worthy of the highest honours in Arthur-story, though he kept not the state of the virgin three who alone achieved the Quest of the Holy Graal `[" Gauwains, Gauwain ! mult a lone tans que tu fus chiualers, et onques puis ne seruis ton creatour, se peu non : tu ies mais si vieus arbres qu'il n'a en toi ne fuelle ne fruit, car tu penses que nostre sires en eust la moule et l'escorche, puis que li anemis en a eu la flour et le fruit." Nasciens to Gawain, *Queste*, p. 144. Again: " et quant il vous vit, si s'en ala, car nous auies le lieu ordi de uotre pechie, et quant il s'en ala il vous dist, ' chiualer plain de poure foi et de poure creanche, ches iij. choses vous faillent : carite, abstinenche, et uerites, et pour che n'en poes auenir as auentures del saint graal.'" Queste, p. 133, ed. F. J. F. for Koxb. Club, 1864. — F.]` — Galahad, Percival, Bors, —yet the sweetness of his spirit, his never-failing gentleness to poor as well as rich, to frightful dames as well as beauties, made him the favourite of most `[Others consistently run him down.]` of the Arthur-writers, and they sang his praises and his prowess, blessed him with the loveliest wives — the second appears here — and, with Israelitish unction, added many concubines. In contrast with him, here, is not only crabbed Kay, but also the Christian Bishop who has sunk the humility of his religion in the pride of his office, has forgotten that

It ffitteth a clarke to be curteous and ffree,

and gets accordingly a rap on his crown that sends him down. But Gawaine does not fail : what courtesy requires, that he does, all that his host asks ; and so, escapes himself, and rescues his friends, from the fate that had befallen 1500 men before who " coude not their curtasye," — death at the hand and mouths of the Carle and his Four Whelps. As of the Turke (vol. i. p. 101, 1. 288) so of the Carle, Gawaine strikes off the head; the bale that Necromancy had wrought is turned to bliss, the loathsome giant becomes again a man, and Gawaine weds the lady gay. What is not possible to those sweet souls who sun their world, at whose presence words of wrath and thoughts of evil cease, the remembrance even of whose smile wins us from bitterness and gloom ? — F.

`[I'll tell you about Sir Gawaine. Arthur stayed a while in Wales, and one day said he'd hear Mass, and then go hunting. Murrock was glad. Kay too,]`

He is the celebrated Twain or Owain sometimes surnamed Le Grand, son of Urien, king of Moray, according to Geoffrey, or of Rheged, according to the Welsh authorities. His exploits were celebrated in French verse by Chrestien de Troyes, and thence trans lated into the German, Icelandic, Welsh, and English languages ; for which consult Benecke's edition of Iwein der Riter mit dem Lewen, 8vo, Berlin, 1827 ; Von der Hagen's Grundriss zur Geschichte der Deutschen Poesie, 8vo, Berlin, 1812, p. 118; Eitson's Metrical Romances, vol. i., and Notes, vol. iii., 8vo. 1802 ; and Lady C.

TH NOTES:

King Arthur and men had been out hunting, 500 deer and more had been killed.

Sir Gawain, Sir Kay and Bishop Baldwin chased a reindeer from mid-morning to late afternoon

Horn sounded to end the hunt, but continued, magic forest of Inglewood??? Deer disappeared, needed accommodation. Let's sleep under tree said Gawain. Sir Kay wanted to find lodgings. Bishop knew a place - Carle of Carlisle, lived in a nearby castle. THough he'd heard knights who stayed their only got out with a beating, if at all. Kay is up for it, to give as good as he gets.

Gawain is sure they can do it nicely.

Knokc at gates, scene with porter: Gawain nice, Kay up for a fight, porter telling them they'll all be sorry.

Brought in, shocked to see 4 wild animals round the fire: a bull, a boar, a lion and a bear. The Carle treated them like dogs as thy got up and snappd at the knights and the Bishop.

Carle was a giant - two yards across and 9 yards tall. No pillar supported the root thicker than his thighs.

Gawain bowed, the Carle said no niceties, he was not a Lord, the courtesy would be rough and ready. Get wine, sent his cup back when it was too small, wanted a large cup, holding 9 gallons, held in one hand.

Bishop went out to check his horse, eating straw next to a huge colt; he slapped the colt to send it awy from his horse, giant asked wtf? and that he'd give Bishop a slap - "but i'm a Bishop, a man of god". WHo has no respect, thwack... and knocked Bishop unconscious.

Sir Kay came out, found his horse next to the colt, slapped it on the flank, giant saw this, knocked him unconscious to th ground.

After a while they returned, Gawain asked where they've been: "checking the horses", running their heads.

Gawain asked to do the same, saw the colt outside in the rain, took it inside, saying it was his masters not theirs. The Carle thankd him.

Food was brought. The Bishop tucked straight in. Sir Kay sat by the beautiful wife of the Carle and started eyeing and chatting her up ("What's a lovely girl like you doing with a brute like him" etc) as the Carle glared at him. Gawain waited politely to be invited to sit.

The Carle asked him to do something for him - throw a spear at his head. Do it... Gawain did, threw the spear so quickly - sparks behind the head of the Carle on the wall. gawain didnlt ususally miss - how had h dodged it? The Carle thanked him, sat him opposite his wife. He was taken in by her beauty, the Carle said his desire was pointless She was his wife. Do not think more of her. Gawain blushed.

Carle's daughter called for, pretty, beautifully and expensively dressed. "Where is your harp?" the finst harp, and she played a beautiful tune, sang a song about th exploits of Arthur.

Comfortable, but simple rooms were found for Kay and the Bishop, Gawain was shown to the Carle's bedchamber and told he should make himself comfortable there. THen the Carle's wife came in and Gawain was told to kiss her while the Carle watched. gawain did as askd, kissed her again, their embrace got more intimate "WHoa" said the Carle, but you did as I asked. So you will not go unrewarded, And he sent for his daughter and said Gawain may snd th night with her.

Kay and the Bishop were up early, and Kay was all for laving, but the Bishop said they should wait for Gawain (it's all a bit Top Gear / Grand Tour, Clarkson,Hammond and May).

The Carle had got up early too, checking preparations for breakfast; the bell was rung for mass, and dutiful Gawain got up to go, asking when he would see the Carle's daughter again.

After Mass, Gawain made to go, but the Carle said "stay for breakfast".

> " Twenty winters have passed now, since I made a vow before God, one that has brought me much discredit. I made a pledge that no man should spend the night in my castle unless he did everything I asked him to do, or else he should be slain. Knight, page, earl or squire, I have never found a single man able to survive this pledge, except for you. May God reward you! I am delighted! Through the grace of Mary, Queen of Heaven, my sorrow is turned to joy!’"

Cale showed Gawain a building filled with dead men's bones, the ground blood stained. "I did this with my animals".

Gawain invited in for breakfast, and Bishop and Kay. Bishop was given a mitre, a ring and a gold cloth, Kay a war horse. Gawain, his daughter, a riding horse, and a pack horse laden down with gold.

Gawain sent with the Carle's blessing, and his daughter.

Arthur relieved to see them; Kay told him the Carle wanted to dine with him. Fabulous banquet, Arthur made him a knight of the round table, Knight of Carlisle.

Carlisle then had an abbey built, and the souls of the men he had killd were evermore prayed for.

c. 1550?

> Arthur and his court are staying in Wales. The king requests Bishop Baldwin to say a mass and then sets out with his knights to hunt. Gawain, Kay and Baldwin become separated from the group and decide to seek shelter in the castle of the Carle of Carlisle, who is well known for mistreating his guests. Kay threatens to repay any ill-treatment with violence, but Gawain insists that they behave courteously. He covers up Kay’s rudeness to the porter, and they stable their horses before entering the hall. Their host is a hideous giant, but Gawain greets him politely and he welcomes the knights, reminding them, however, of his animosity to Arthur. The Carle calms his pets (a bear, a boar, a bull and a lion) and his beautiful wife appears, sitting on his knee and singing songs about love: Gawain politely compliments her, but the Carle admonishes him for thinking of 'villainy'.
>
> One by one the knights leave the hall to check on their horses. Kay and Baldwin both turn the Carle’s own palfrey out of his stable, and are rewarded for their discourteous behaviour with violent buffets from their host. Gawain, however, covers the horse with his cloak and is thanked courteously. Back in the hall, the Carle calls for an enormous cup of wine, and they all drink.
>
> As they dine, the Carle bids Gawain throw a spear at him. The knight obeys with such force that, when the Carle ducks, it shatters against the wall. He then leads Gawain to a chamber where his wife is lying in bed, instructing him to kiss her three times but go no further. Gawain complies and becomes aroused, but his host stops the knight and leads him to his daughter’s chamber, ushering him into her bed and locking the door. In the morning, the Carl shows Gawain the bloody armour and bones of his former victims, then when the knight politely attempts to leave, insists that he stay for another meal. Afterwards, he presents Gawain with a sword and tells him to cut off his head. Gawain obeys and the Carle is transformed into a normal man. He thanks Gawain for breaking a curse that has lasted forty years, promising to found a chantry for his victims and welcome all future guests. Baldwin marries Gawain to the Carle’s daughter, and their host presents them with rich gifts, begging them to invite Arthur to dine with him. The king agrees, and the following day they all return to the Carle’s castle, which has been decorated for a lavish feast. The Carle promises to treat the king with 'great courtesy', and Arthur is so pleased that he knights the Carle before returning to his court.
