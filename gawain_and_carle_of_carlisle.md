# Sir Gawain and the Carle of Carlisle

A story I came across by chance whilst I was looking for Arthurian tales, which once found just seems to keep cropping up. I don't recall ever having heard this tale told before, perhaps because a telling without some adaptation may cause some tricky moments when it comes to the scenes featuring the Carle's wife and daughter...

In certain respects, it is reminiscent of "Gawain and the Green Knight", not least in the temptation of Gawain. I get the sense it could be told for laughs in a bloke-ish way, though I'm not sure that's my style.

CHAPTER SIX — GAWAIN

...

pp107-9

*Sir Gawain and the Carl of Carlisle* embodies a similar test and disenchantment story. It exists in two versions: that in the Porkington manuscript of the fifteenth century, and the much corrupted poem in the Percy folio, in a different metre. The former is the earlier, although the omission of the beheading and its disenchanting effect would at first imply a later recension. However, a point so far overlooked will explain this. Where the Percy MS. inserts the decapitation, there is apparently a missing leaf in the other version, since after line 515, a new leaf is started, on which the first line is by a second but coeval hand. This implies that the leaf was lost at a very early date, and the added line was inserted to supply the rhyme.

The story is not without some interest; it is a good example of the material of the primitive romances. Arthur and his knights go hunting, and Bishop Baldwin, Kay and Gawain pursue a deer by themselves, and lose their way. They come to the castle of the Carl of Carlisle, of which, Baldwin tells them, it is said that no man ever stayed there and escaped with his life. None the less, they enter, and meet the Carl, a hideous giant who keeps four pets in his hall—a bear, a boar, a bull and a lion. Gawain is always courteous and obedient to his host, while the others break all the rules of good conduct. He is asked by the Carl to throw a spear at him, which he obediently does; the Carl dodges the missile, and then, leading Gawain to his wife’s chamber, puts him in her bed and bids him kiss her three times, but no more. He then leads him to his daughter, with whom he spends the night. The next morning the Carl bids Gawain cut off his head, which the latter reluctantly does; whereupon the Carl changes into an ordinary man, and tells Gawain that he has been under a spell which forced him to act thus until a knight obeyed all his commands, those who failed to do so being killed by him and his ‘pets’. Gawain weds the Carl’s daughter and they return to court, where the Carl is made a knight of the Round Table.

This romance, in its earlier form 660 verses in length, comes from the same district as The Turk and Gawain. It seems to be a direct translation of some Irish or Celtic story, and there is little evidence of any French version having been used. The closest parallel yet found is the Irish Curoz’s Castle, in which the giant has similarly four beasts, the accompanying knights fail the test, and the hero obeys an order to hurl a spear at the giant.!2 A story similar to the incident of the host’s daughter is found in Norse saga, but the connection is only slight.18

Apart from the disenchantment, the framework of the romance is an example of the Imperious Host motif found in every European folklore. Anyone arriving at the host’s castle who does not implicitly obey his word, even if politeness would seem to require disobedience, is automatically killed. This trial would be an obvious qualifying test for the disenchantment by decapitation, which can only be performed by the bravest of knights. So, in spite of wide superficial variations The Turk and Gawain and Sir Gawain and the Carl of Carlisle are in fact two forms of the same theme.

A slightly more elaborate overview of the tale, and the two sources in which it is found, are provided by George Kittredge in *A study of Gawain and the Green Knight*.

The Carl of Carlisle

A second instance of the Temptation, in which the supernatural setting is fully preserved, and which illustrates almost everything that has been preliminarily said about these matters, is found in the extraordinary Middle English romance of *The Carl of Carlisle*. This piece is preserved in the Porkington MS. (about 1450-60) and Bishop Percy's Folio MS. (about 1650). Comparison of the Porkington version with that in the Percy Folio shows that we have to do with two texts of a single English poem, not with two independent compositions on a similar theme or two independent renderings of a common original. The identity of phraseology is sufficient to prove this beyond a shadow of doubt. The Porkington text is in tail-rhyme stanzas, the Percy text is in short couplets. Clearly one is a redaction of the other.

It is usually held that the Percy version is a ballad made out of the Porkington version by rejecting the *rimes couées*. But the assumption is not justified. The Percy version is not a ballad, though Madden prints it in quasi-ballad stanzas. It is simply a romance in short couplets, and is not stanzaic. The Porkington MS. is about two hundred years older than the Percy Folio, but that is no reason for inferring that the version which it contains is later than the Porkington version. Nor is there any antecedent probability that a romance in *rime couée* is older than a romance in short couplets: on the contrary, couplets were in earlier use in such poems. Indeed, the Percy MS. itself preserves the couplet-version of Marie's *Lai de Lanval* which was utilized by Thomas Chestre as the basis of his tail-rhyme romance of *Launfal*. It was long held that Chestre's stanzaic romance (which happens to be preserved in an older MS.) was the original of the Launfal in short couplets, but this view is now given up. The presumption, then, is that the Percy version of the Carl of Carlisle is the older. At all events, the Percy version preserves an important part of the romance which the text afforded by the Porkington MS. has lost. `[See pp. 88-89, 301-302.]` In most regards, however, the Porkington MS. furnishes a better text.

The Carl of Carlisle was probably translated or adapted from some French poem. The extant French version of a similar story, however, which forms a part of the *Chevalier à l'Épée*, is certainly not the source of the English romance. The two go back to a common source, which the English Carl represents much more faithfully than the French. The brutalities of the English poem must not lightly be regarded as debasements. They should be compared with the tone of the incident just quoted from Ider. A summary of the English romance will show how significant it is in the present investigation. I follow the Porkington text, except as indicated, usually disregarding trivial variations of the Percy MS.

King Arthur is sojourning at Cardiff [the Percy MS. says simply in Wales] with many knights (including Sir Raynbrown, " the knight of arms green "). `[The Percy text does not say that the " Knight of armes green " is present, but mentions him (with no personal name) in connection with his father Sir Ironside.]` One day, in the course of a hunt, Sir Gawain, Sir Kay, and Bishop Baldwin follow a reindeer (red deer, Percy) into a wide forest. A thick mist rises, and they give up all hope of rejoining their companions that night. The Bishop knows of a possible harborage. There is a " Carl in a castle " near-by; he is called the Carl of Carlisle. But no one ever put up with him without being beaten, and, if he got off with his life, he had only God's grace to thank. Kay blusters: he should like to visit the Carl; they will beat him if he is not complaisant. Gawain, on the contrary, says he will try what fair speech can accomplish. They ride to the Carl's gate, and Gawain sends in the porter with a courteous request for lodging. The porter warns them that they will be sorry for their coming, as he is, — his lord is an evil man.

The three guests are promptly admitted, and enter the hall, while their steeds are taken to the stable. The Carl is described as a giant, dreadful to see, with wide mouth, gray beard, long locks, and a hooked nose. It is a large span between his eyebrows and two (three, Percy) tailor's yards across his shoulders; he is nine yards (fifty cubits, Percy) in height. Four strange " whelps " are lying by the fire, — a wild bull, a felon boar, a Hon, and a huge bear. They are about to attack the guests, but creep under the table at a word from their master. The Carl receives his guests politely enough, and offers them wine out of a nine-gallon bowl.

Baldwin, Kay, and Gawain, one after another, go out to look after their horses. Baldwin and Kay, finding that a little foal of the Carl's is feeding by the side of their palfreys, turn him out, with contumely, and are rewarded by the Carl with a tremendous buffet. Gawain sees the foal standing in the rain, puts him in, and covers him with his own green mantle. The Carl thanks him for his courtesy.

Supper is ready by this time, and seats are assigned to the Bishop and Sir Kay. The Carl's wife has a place opposite Kay at the table.

She is very lovely and gloriously arrayed. " Alas," thinks Kay, " that so fair a lady should be matched with so foul a wight! " The Carl reads his thought and rebukes him. Gawain is still standing in the hall floor, not having been bidden to sit. The Carl tells him to dart a spear at him, and to hit him " even in the face " if he can. The spear is well aimed, but the Carl dodges. He then gives Gawain a place at table opposite his wife, with whom the knight at once falls so deeply in love that he can neither eat nor drink. Observing his abstraction, the Carl tells him to drink his wine — the lady is not for him. The Carl's daughter, a very beautiful girl, richly attired, then appears; she harps and sings. Then the Bishop and Sir Kay are conducted to their chamber. But Gawain is led to the Carl's own chamber, and bidden by the Carl to go to bed to his wife, take her in his arms, and kiss her [thrice, Percy]. Gawain obeys, and when the situation becomes critical, the Carl interferes, but, in reward for the knight's obedience, lodges him with his daughter, to their mutual satisfaction.

Next morning `[For the rest of the story the Percy MS. is followed.]` the Carl takes Gawain to a room in which there are the bones of fifteen hundred men (ten cartloads of bones, Porkington) and many a bloody sark. " All these," says the Carl, " I and my whelps have slain." After dinner the Carl conducts Gawain to an armory and, selecting a sword, commands Gawain to smite off his head. Gawain is reluctant, but his host threatens to smite off his if he declines, and the deed is done. Instantly the Carl " stands up, a man of the height of Sir Gawain " [no longer a monstrous giant]. He thanks Gawain for delivering him from the witchcraft under which he has suffered so long. Forty years ago he was thus transformed by necromancy, and since that time he and his whelps have slain every guest who did not do his bidding. Gawain is the first who has stood this test, and now the evil custom is abolished. " God reward you, for all my bale is brought to bliss! " The three guests are dismissed with rich presents, Gawain taking with him the Carl's daughter, to whom he has been married by the good bishop. Next day Arthur dines with the transformed Carl, and makes him a knight of the Round Table, establishing him as lord of Carlisle.

For the conclusion of the romance I have based the summary on the Percy MS., which is clearly right in almost every detail. The Porkington text omits the disenchantment by decapitation. The Carl, after inviting his guests to dinner, tells Gawain that for twenty years `[This is doubtless better than " forty " (the Percy reading).]` no man has lodged with him without being slain. The condition of the exemption was that his guests should do his bidding in every particular, and Gawain is the first who has stood the test. "Now," says the Carl, "my bale is brought to bliss," and he prays God to reward his deliverer. Then he shows Gawain the ghastly remains of the victims, and promises to forsake his wicked customs, and to practise true hospitality hereafter for Gawain's sake. Dinner follows. Then the guests depart with splendid presents, Gawain taking the daughter with him. Next day King Arthur and his knights dine with the Carl and are nobly entertained. Arthur dubs the Carl knight, makes him one of the fellowship of the Round Table, and grants him the country of Carlisle as a fief. Gawain weds the daughter, and there is a fortnight's festival.

Not only is there no beheading in the Porkington text, but the Carl says nothing about being under a spell. However, the situation is clear enough without express words, and hisjntense feeling of relief at being able to abandon his evil ways is proof enough that he had been acting under magic co mpulsion. There is also not a word about the Carl's losing his monstrous shape, though that is clearly a sine qua non for his being made a knight of the Round Table — an incident that the Porkington text retains.

NOTES p. 344-

THIS romantic tale is here printed for the first time from an unique copy discovered in one of the MSS. of the Porkington Library, No. 10, belonging to William Ormsby Gore, Esq., M.P., written at the close of the reign of Henry the Sixth. It is more particularly interesting from its being the original from which the modernised copy in the Percy MS. was taken. The question, therefore, of the genuineness and antiquity of the romance-poems (as distinguished from the longer and better known romances,) in this celebrated MS. would seem to be decided, for as *two* of these poems, namely, *The Grene Knight* and *The Carle of Carlile*, have been preserved in MSS. of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, it is not too much to suppose, that the rest of the tales in the volume of a similar description, although written at so late a period as the latter half of the seventeenth century were derived from ancient texts, which may yet be lurking in the unexplored treasures of some cathedral, collegiate, or private library.

The original of this story must be sought for in the literature of the continent, and we find it in the beautiful fabliau of *Le Chevalier à L'Epée*, printed in Meon's *Recueil*, tome i. p. 127, 8vo, 1823, and previously analysed by Le Grand. Both works are so well known as to render any repetition of it here unnecessary.

TH: the notes along the side of the poem summarise the tale:

> I'll tell you about Sir Gawaine. Arthur stayed a while in Wales, and one day said he'd hear Mass, and then go hunting. Murrock was glad. Kay too, and Lancelot, Percival, Ewaine, Lott, the Green Knight, Gawaine, Mordred, Lybius Disconyus, and Iron side, who was better than any of Arthur's knights, and got his name because he went always armed, to fight giants. Beagles ran, greyhounds pulled down the deer, and by noon 100 harts were killed. But Gawaine, Kay, and Bishop Bodwin, lose their way in following a red deer. Gawaine proposes to dismount, and stay all night in the forest. Kay says he'll lodge in some body's house. No one dare stop him. The Bishop says, "The Carle of Carlisle will: he never lets any man lodge with him. " " If he refuses me, I'll beat him till he stinks," says Kay. Gawaine tells Kay not to brag ; they'll try fair speech first; if that's no good, Kay may scold. They ride to the Earl's gate. Gawaine knocks, and tells the Porter that they are tired out with hunting, and ask his lord for a night's lodging. Kay threatens the Porter, but he answers boldly. Gawaine asks him courteously, and the Porter gives his message to the Carle. The Carle regrets that they have been kept so long waiting. Gawaine &c. ride in, go to the hall, and see the Carle, a loathly man, with fingers like stakes and hands like leaves. Gawaine salutes him courteously, and the Carle welcomes them for Arthur's sake, though Arthur and he have long been foes. They go to the tables, and see 4 whelps, a bear, a boar, a bull, and a lion. A fair lady seats herself on the Carle's knee and Gawaine says her bedfellow will be a happy man. The Carie reproves him. Kay goes to the stable, finds the  palfrey next to his, turns it out, and gives it a clout. The Carle knocks Kay down. Kay threatens him, and he tells Kay that if he says any more he'll get more knocks. Then the Bishop goes to look at his palfrey. He finds the Carle's there, and turns it out with a cut, to go to the devil. The Carle knocks the Bishop over, he cares nothing for mitre or ring. Then Gawaine goes to see his palfrey. He finds the Carle's foal by it, wet with rain. Gawaine covers the foal with his mantle and tells it to eat away. The Carle thanks Gawaine, takes him in, calls for a bowl of wine, and drinks 15 gallons at one draught. Then they all have supper. After it, the Carle tells Gawaine to take a spear and to mark him in his face. Gawaine takes the spear, charges at the Carle (who dodges his head,) runs the spear into the wall, and breaks it off. Then the Carle takes Gawaine to his wife's bed, and bids him get in and kiss her, but do nothing more. Gawaine does so and thinks to do more, but the Carle stops him, and takes him to his daughter's bed, and tells him to get into it. Gawaine does so, and the Carle goes away, locking the door. Next morning, he calls Gawaine, and shows him bloody shirts and 1500 dead men's bones, slain by him, the Carle. Gawaine wants to take leave, but the Carle makes him stop to dinner. After it he shows Gawaine a sword, and begs him to cut his (the Carle's) head off. Gawaine refuses, whereupon the Carle says he'll cut his head off if he don't do it. So Gawaine cuts the Carle's head off, and he stands up a proper man, and thanks Gawaine for delivering him from the witchcraft that 40 years ago transformed him, so to be till a Knight of the Round Table should cut his head off. " Christ reward you! Henceforth I'll kill no one; but every body shall be welcome to me." The Bishop marries Gawaine and the Carle's daughter. The Carle gives Kay a blood-red steed, and Gawaine's lady a white palfrey. Then he bids Gawaine go to Arthur and ask him to dine with him next day. Gawaine goes singing with his lady, and tells Arthur his adventures. Kay gives Arthur the Carle's invitation. Arthur and his company ride off, are received at the Carle's with sound of trumpet, harp, gittern, and psaltery ; tables are laid, and the feast begins, minstrels playing the while. Arthur likes his dinner, knights the Carle, gives him Carlisle, makes him an Earl, and a Knight of the Round Table, and christens him Carlisle. After dinner the guests go home. May God bring our souls to heaven! Amen!

__Carle off Carlyle__ `[A curious Song of the Marriage of Sir Gawane, one of King Arthur's Knights.— P.]`:

THIS poem was printed from the Folio by Sir F. Madden in the Appendix to his *Syr Gawayne* for the Bannatyne Club, pp. 256-74. Some of his readings of the MS. differ from mine; and though, if I can trust my eyes, the MS. does not make all the mistakes that Sir F. Madden attributes to it, I have thought it only due to his well-established reputation and great experience in reading MSS., as well as to our readers, who will probably trust him rather than me, to put his readings in the notes. The poem is, as he says, a modernised copy of the *Syre Gawene and the Carle of Carelyle* in the Porkington MS. No. 10, " written in the reign of Edward IV.," printed by him (Sir F. Madden) in the Appendix to his *Syr Gawayne*, pp. 187-206. Though Mrs. Ormsby Gore has kindly lent me this Porkington MS., I have not collated the Folio with it, as its *Syre Gawene* will be printed by Mr. Richard Morris for the Early English Text Society next year, and will there be easily accessible to all readers. The alterations are great in words, small in incidents, and the earlier poem is the better one. Sir F. Madden looks on the occurrence of the present poem and *The Grene Knight* (vol. ii. p. 58) in our Folio as settling the " question of the genuineness and antiquity of the romance-poems (as distinguished from the longer and bettor-known romances) in this celebrated MS." — that is, that the Folio poems are not abstracts made of the old romances in the seventeenth century, but retellings or adaptations of abstracts made in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. " The original of this story must be sought for in the literature of the Continent, and we find it in the beautiful *fabliau of Le Chevalier à l'Epée*, printed in Meon's *Recueil*, tome i. p. 127, 8vo, 1823, and pre viously analysed by Le Grand. "

Like the other Gawaine stories in the Folio, this one takes us into weirdland, the region where necromancers have been at work, where Kelts loved specially to range. And, as in *The Turks and Gawin* and *The Marriage of Sir Gawaine*, the counter charm which undoes the fiendly work is Gawaine's courtesy. Though he was not held worthy of the highest honours in Arthur-story, though he kept not the state of the virgin three who alone achieved the Quest of the Holy Graal `[" Gauwains, Gauwain ! mult a lone tans que tu fus chiualers, et onques puis ne seruis ton creatour, se peu non : tu ies mais si vieus arbres qu'il n'a en toi ne fuelle ne fruit, car tu penses que nostre sires en eust la moule et l'escorche, puis que li anemis en a eu la flour et le fruit." Nasciens to Gawain, *Queste*, p. 144. Again: " et quant il vous vit, si s'en ala, car nous auies le lieu ordi de uotre pechie, et quant il s'en ala il vous dist, ' chiualer plain de poure foi et de poure creanche, ches iij. choses vous faillent : carite, abstinenche, et uerites, et pour che n'en poes auenir as auentures del saint graal.'" Queste, p. 133, ed. F. J. F. for Koxb. Club, 1864. — F.]` — Galahad, Percival, Bors, —yet the sweetness of his spirit, his never-failing gentleness to poor as well as rich, to frightful dames as well as beauties, made him the favourite of most `[Others consistently run him down.]` of the Arthur-writers, and they sang his praises and his prowess, blessed him with the loveliest wives — the second appears here — and, with Israelitish unction, added many concubines. In contrast with him, here, is not only crabbed Kay, but also the Christian Bishop who has sunk the humility of his religion in the pride of his office, has forgotten that

It ffitteth a clarke to be curteous and ffree,

and gets accordingly a rap on his crown that sends him down. But Gawaine does not fail : what courtesy requires, that he does, all that his host asks ; and so, escapes himself, and rescues his friends, from the fate that had befallen 1500 men before who " coude not their curtasye," — death at the hand and mouths of the Carle and his Four Whelps. As of the Turke (vol. i. p. 101, 1. 288) so of the Carle, Gawaine strikes off the head; the bale that Necromancy had wrought is turned to bliss, the loathsome giant becomes again a man, and Gawaine weds the lady gay. What is not possible to those sweet souls who sun their world, at whose presence words of wrath and thoughts of evil cease, the remembrance even of whose smile wins us from bitterness and gloom ? — F.

hee cold more of honor in warr  
then all the Knights that with Arthur weare  
burning dragons he slew in Land,  
& wilde beasts, as I vnderstand ;  
wilde beares he slew that stond ;  
a hardyer Knight was neuer ffound ;  
he was called in his dayes  
one of King Arthurs ffellowes.  
why was hee called Ironsyde ?

hee wold allwais arms beare,

& by noone of the same day

then Sir Gawaine & Sir Kay,  
& Bishopp Bodwin, as I heard say,  
after a redd deere `[rayne-dere, and reyne-dere, 1. 79. — Pork.]` thé rode  
into a fforrest wyde & brode.  
a thicke mist ffell them among,  
that caused `[Only half the u in the MS.— F. caised. — Madden.]` them all to goe wronge :  
great moane made then Sir Kay  
that they shold loose the hart that day ;  
that red hart wold not dwell.  
hearken what aduentures them beffell :  
ffull sore thé were adread  
ere the any Lodginge had ;  
then spake Sir Gawaine,  
" this Labour wee haue had in vaine ;  
this red hart is out of sight,  
wee meete with him no more this night.  
I reede wee of our horsses do light,  
& lodge wee heere all this night ;  
Truly itt is best, as thinketh mee,  
to Lodge low vnder this tree."  
" nay," said Kay, " goe wee hence anon,  
ffor I will lodge whersoere `[wherforre, Madden's text : whersoever ?, his note. — F.]` I come ;  
for there dare no man warne me, `[wern hit me. — Pork]`  
of whatt estate soeuer hee bee."  
" yes," said the Bishopp, " that wott I well ;  
here dwelleth a Carle in a Castele,  
the Carle of Carlile is his name,
I know itt well by St. Iame ;

`[and by noon 100 harts were killed. But Gawaine, Kay, and Bishop Bodwin, lose their way in following a red deer. Gawaine proposes to dismount, and stay all night in the forest. Kay says he'll lodge in some body's house. No one dare stop him. The Bishop says, "The Carle of Carlisle will:]`

`[he never lets any man lodge with him. " If he refuses me, I'll beat him till he stinks," says Kay. Gawaine tells Kay not to brag ; they'll try fair speech first; if that's no good, Kay may scold.]`

that durst lodge within his hold ;  
but, & if hee scape `[staye. — Madden.]` with his liffe away,  
hee ruleth him well, I you say." `[It schall be bette, as I harde say, And ȝefe he go wtt lyfe away. —Porkington MS.]`
then said Kay, " all in ffere, `[i.e. together. Perhaps all on fire. —P]`  
to goe thither is my desire ;  
ffor & the Carle be neuer soe bolde,  
I thinke to lodge within his hold.  
ffor if he iangle & make itt `[him.— P.]` stout,  
I shall beate the Carle all about,  
& I shall make his bigging bare,  
& doe to him mickle Care ;  
& I shall beate [him,] as I thinke,  
till he both sweate and stinke."  
then said the Bishopp, " so mote I ffare,  
att his bidding I wilbe yare."  
Gawaine said " lett be thy bostlye ffare, `[Compare vol. i. p. 91, 1. 25-30. Kay was the braggart of Arthur's court.]`  
ffor thou dost euer waken care.  
if thou scape `[Madden reads the MS. stape, and corrects it to scape. — F.]` with thy liffe away,  
thou ruleth thee well, I dare say."  
then said Kay, " that pleaseth mee ;  
thither Let vs ryde all three.  
such as hee bakes, such shall hee brew ;  
such as hee shapes, such shall hee sew ;  
such as he breweth, such shall he `[him ?. — Madden.]` drinke."  
" that is contrary," said Gawaine, " as I thinke ;  
but if any ffaire speeche will he gaine,  
wee shall make him Lord within his owne `[aine (in pencil). — P. Pork, has the talk 1. 104-30 somewhat differently.-F.]` ;  
if noe ffaire speech will auayle,  
then to karp on Kay wee will not ffaile."  

`[They ride to the Earl's gate. Gawaine knocks, and tells the Porter that they are tired out with hunting, and ask his lord for a night's lodging. Kay threatens the Porter, but he answers boldly. Gawaine asks him courteously, and the Porter gives his]`

then said the Bishopp, " thai senteth `[Madden reads tenteth.—F.]` mee ;  
thither lett vs ryde all three."  
when they came to the carles gate,  
a hammer they ffound hanging theratt :  
Gawaine hent the hammer in his hand,  
& curteouslye on the gates dange.  
fforth came the Porter with still ffare,  
saying, " who is soe bold to knocke there ? "  
Gawaine answered him curteouslye  
"man," hee said, " that is I. `[" It am I " is the earlier phrase. — F.]`  
wee be 2 "Knights of Arthurs inn,  
& a Bishopp, no moe to min `[min, ming, i.e. mention, vide v. 162.—P.]` ;
wee haue rydden all day in the fforrest still

ffor Arthurs sake, thai is our Kinge,  
wee desire my Lord of a nights Lodginge,

that wee may scape `[Madden again reads stape, and corrects to scape. — F.]` away without scorne." `[Pork, puts in the Porter's answer, warning them that his lord "can no cortessye," and that they will not escape without a "wellony." — F.]`  
Then spake the crabbed Knight Sir Kay :  
" Porter, our errand I reede the say,`[thou say or thee (to) say. — P.]`  
or else the Castle gate wee shall breake,  
& the Keyes thereof to Arthur take."  
the Porter sayd with words throe, `[tho, i. e. then.— P. A.S. þrà, bold.— F.]`  
" theres no man aliue that dares doe soe !  
of `[If.— P.]` a 100d such as thou his death had sworne,  
yett he wold ryde on hunting to morne. `[to-morrow.— P.]`  
" then answered GAWAIN thai was curteous aye,  
" Porter, our errand I pray thee say."  
"yes," said the Porter, " withouten ffayle  
I shall say your errand ffull well."
as soone as the Porter the Carle see,  
hee kneeled downe vpon his knee :  
"Yonder beene 2 Knights of Arthurs in, `[inne.— P.]`  
& a Bishopp, no more to myn ;  
they haue roden all day in the fforrest still,  
that horsse [&] man `[horse & man. — P.]` is like to spill ;  
they desire you ffor Arthirs sake, their Kmg,  
to grant them one nights Lodginge,  
& herberrow till the day att Morne  
that they may scape `[Madden again reads stape, and corrects to scape. — F.]` away without scorne."  
"noe thing greeues `[Half the u left out in the MS.— F.]` me," sayd the Carle without doubt,  
" but that they `[the.— P.]` Knights stand soe long without."  
with that they `[the.— P.]` Porter opened the gates wyde,  
& the Knights rode in that tyde.  
their steeds into the stable are tane,  
the Knights into the hall are gone `[gane.— P.]` :  
heere the Carle sate in his chaire on hye,  
with his legg cast ouer the other knee ;  
his mouth was wyde, & his beard was gray,  
his lockes on his shoulders lay ;  
betweene his browes, certaine  
itt was large there a spann,  
with 2 great eyen brening as ffyer.  
Lord ! hee was a Lodlye syer `[a lodlye sire, i. e. filthy, p. 387. — P.]` !  
ouer his sholders he bare `[bore. — Madden.]` a bread  
3 taylors yards, as clarkes doe reade ;  
his ffingars were like to teddar stakes, `[The stakes by which, the hair lines are fasten'd to the ground that are tied to the horses' feet when they graze in open fields.— P. Madden reads tedder. — F.]`  
& his hands like breads that wiues may bake ;  

`[message to the Carle. The Carle regrets that they have been kept so long waiting. Gawaine &c. ride in, go to the hall, and see the Carle, a loathly man, with fingers like stakes and hands like leaves.]`

`[Gawaine salutes him courteously, and the Carle welcomes them for Arthur's sake, though Arthur and he have long been foes. They go to the tables, and see 4 whelps, a bear, a boar, a bull, and a lion.]`

50 Cubitts `[ix. taylloris ȝerdis. — Pork.]` he was in height ;  
Lord, he was a Lothesome wight !  
when Sir Gawaine that carle see,  
he halched `[i.e. saluted. — P. Madden reads the MS. haltled, and corrects it to halsed. Halche is O. N. heilsa, Dan. hilsa, to salute, to cry hail to. Wedgwood. — P.]` him ffull curteouslye,  
& saith, " carle of Carlile, `[" Callile, MS.," says Madden.— P.]` god sane thee
as thou sitteth in thy prosperitye ! "  
the carle said, " as christ `[Madden reads cheif, and puts " Crist ? " in his note. — P.]` me saue, `[perhaps take. — P.]`  
yee shall be welcome ffor Arthurs sake.  
`[yt et in MS.— P.]` yet is itt not my part to doe soe,  
ffor Arthur hath beene euer my ffoe ;  
he hath beaten my "Knights, & done them bale,  
`[sent.— P.]` & send them wounded to my owne hall,  
yett the truth to tell I will not Leane, `[vid. p. 367, St. 45 [of MS.].— P. See Dr. Robson's note in Sir John Butler above. Madden says "leave, MS." — P.]`  
I haue quitt him the same againe."  
" that is a kind of a knaue `[A c follows in the MS.— P.]`," said Kay, " without Leasing,  
soe to reuile a Noble King."  
Gawaine heard, & made an s were,  
" Kay, thou sayst more then meete weere."  
with that they went ffurther into the hall,  
where bords were spredd, & couered with pall ;  
& 4 welpes of great Ire  
they ffound Lying by the ffire.  
there was a beare that did rome, `[Cp. the bere to ramy. Pork.— P.]`  
& a bore that did whett his tushes `[tusks. — Madden. — P.]` ffome,
alsoe a bull that did rore,  
& a Lyon that did both gape & rore ;  
the Lyon did both gape and gren.  
" O peace, whelpes ! " said the carle then :  
ffor that word that they carle `[the Carle.— P.]` did speake,  
the 4 whelpes vnder they bord `[the bord. — P.]` did creepe.  
downe came a Lady ffaire & ffree,
& sett her on the carles knee ;  
one whiles shee harped, another whiles song,  
both of Paramours & louinge amonge.  
" well were that man," said Gawaine, " that ere were borne,  
that might Lye with that Lady till day att morne. "  
" that were great shame," said the carle ffree,  
" that thon sholdest doe me such villanye." `[Pork, substitutes a scene of the knights drinking, for this one of the lady ; but describes the Carle's wife at supper-time, p. 197 of Madden's Syr P. Gawayne. -F.]`  
" Sir," said Gawaine, " I sayd nought." 
" no, man," said the carle ; " more thou thought."  
Then start Kay to the fflore,  
& said hee wold see how his palfrey ffore. `[i. e. fared, praet, inusitat. — P.]`  
both corne & hay he ffound Lyand,  
& the carles palfrey by his steed did stand.  
Kay tooke the carles palfrey by the necke,
& soone hee thrust him out att the hecke `[i. e. Cratch, verb. Scot. Dr. Graingr. — P.]` :  
thus Kay put the carles ffole out,  
& on his backe he sett a clout.  
then the carle himselfe hee stood there by,  
and sayd, "this buffett, man, thou shalt abuy.`[abye. — P. Madden reads aby. -F.]` "
The carle raught Kay such a rapp  
that backward he ffell fflatt ;  
had itt not beene ffor a ffeald `[i. e. a truss of straw, Dr. Graingr. —P.]` of straw.  
Kayes backe had gone in 2. `[twa. — P.]`  
then said Kay, " & thow were without thy hold,  
Man ! this buffett shold be deere sold."  
" what," sayd the carle, " dost thou menace me ?

`[A fair lady seats herself on the Carle's knee and Gawaine says her bedfellow will be a happy man. The Carie reproves him. Kay goes to the stable, finds the  palfrey next to his, turns it out, and gives it a clout. The Carle knocks Kay down. Kay threatens him, and he tells Kay]`

`[that if he says any more he'll get more knocks. Then the Bishop goes to look at his palfrey. He finds the Carle's there, and turns it out with a cut, to go to the devil. The Carle knocks the Bishop over, he cares nothing for mitre or ring. Then Gawaine]`

I swere by all soules sicerlye `[Madden reads sikerlye. -F.]` !  
Man ! I swere ffurther thore, `[tho.— P.]`  
if I heere any malice more, `[moe. — P.]`
ffor this one word thai thou hast spoken  
itt is but ernest thou hast gotten."  
then went Kay into the hall,  
& the Bishopp to him can call,  
saith : Brother Kay, where you haue beene ? "  
" to Looke my palffrey, as I weene. `[als I ween, i.e. I also thinke, intend, Sed vid. infra 276. — P. As is thus, like. — F.]` "  
then said the Bishopp, " itt ffalleth me  
that my palfrey I must see."  
both corne & hay he ffound Lyand,  
& the carles palffrey, as I vnderstand.  
the Bishopp tooke the carles horsse by the necke,  
& soone hee thrust him out att the hecke ;  
thus he turned the carles ffole out,  
& on his backe he sett a clout ;  
sais, " wend forth, ffole, in the devills way !  
who made thee soe bold wv'th my palfrey ? "  
the carle himselfe he stood there by :  
" man ! this buffett thou shalt abuy. `[abay, MS. says Madden. — F.]` "
he hitt the Bishopp vpon the crowne,  
that his miter & he ffell downe.  
" Mercy ! " said the Bishopp, " I am a clarke !  
somewhatt I can of chr[i]sts werke."  
he saith, " by the Clergye I sett nothing,  
nor yett by thy Miter nor by thy ringe.  
It ffitteth a clarke to be curteous & ffree,  
by the conning `[MS. coming. — F. cunning or conning. — P.]` of his clergy."  
with that the Bishopp went into the hall,  
& Sir Grawaine to him can call,  
saith, " brother Bishopp where haue you beene ? "  
"to looke my palfrey, as I weene."  
then sayd Sir Gawaine, " itt ffalleth mee  
thai my palfreye I must needs see."  
corne & hay he ffound enoughe Lyand,  
& the carles ffole by his did stand.  
the carles ffole had beene fforth in the raine ;  
therof Sir Gawaine was not ffaine ;  
hee tooke his mantle thai was of greene,  
& couered the ffole, as I weene ;  
sayth, " stand vp, ffole, & eate thy meate ;  
thy M.aster payeth ffor all that wee heere gett."  
they carle `[The Carle.— P.]` himselfe stood thereby,
& thanked him of his curtesye ;  
they carle `[The Carle.— P.]` tooke Gawaine by the hand,
& both together in they hall they wend.  
the carles called ffor a bowle of wine,  
& soone they settled them to dine ;  
70 bowles `[gallons?— Madden. Ordinary bowls. — F.]` in that bowle were, —  
he was not weake that did itt beare, —  
then they `[the.— P.]` carle sett itt to his Chin,  
& said, " to you I will begin ! "  
15 gallons he dranke that tyde,
& raught to his men on euery side.  
then they `[the.— P.]` carle said to them anon,  
" Sirrs, to supper gett you gone ! "  
Gawaine answered the carle then,  
" Sir, att your bidding we will be ben. `[baine.— P.]` "  
" if you be bayne att my bidding,  
you honor me without Leasinge."  
they washed all, & went to meate,  
& dranke the wine thai was soe sweete.  

`[goes to see his palfrey. He finds the Carle's foal by it, wet with rain. Gawaine covers the foal with his mantle and tells it to eat away. The Carle thanks Gawaine, takes him in, calls for a bowl of wine, and drinks 15 gallons at one draught. Then they all have supper.]`

`[After it, the Carle tells Gawaine to take a spear and to mark him in his face. Gawaine takes the spear, charges at the Carle (who dodges his head,) runs the spear into the wall, and breaks it off. Then the Carle takes Gawaine to his wife's bed,]`

the carle said to Gawaine anon,  
"a long speare see thou take in thy hand, `[hond.— P.]`  
att the buttrye dore take thou thy race,  
& marke me well in middest the face.  
" a ! " thought `[Ah! thought.— P.]` Sir Kay, " that that were I !  
then his buffett he shold deere abuy. `[MS. aluy. Madden reads a buy. — F. abuy or abye. — P.]` "  
" well," quoth the carle, " when thou wilt, thou may, `[then thou (yee) may. — P.]`  
when thou wilt thy strength assay." —  
"well Sir," said Kay, " I said nought."  
"Noe," said the carle, "but more thou thought."  
then Gawaine was ffull glad of that,  
& a long spere in his hand he gatt ;  
att the buttery dore `[Madden reads the MS. doe. — F.]` he tooke his race,  
& marked the carle in the middst the fface.  
the carle saw Sir Gawaine come in ire,  
& cast his head vnder his speare,  
Gawaine raught the wall such a rapp,  
the flyer fllew out, & the speare brake ;  
he stroke a ffoote into the wall of stone,  
a bolder Barren was there neuer none.  
" soft," said the carle, "thow was tó radd. `[furious, O. Fr. roide. — Skeat. Roide, rough, fierce, violent. — Cotgrave. A.S. hraed, swift, quick, rush. — F.]` "  
"I did but, Sir, as you me bade."  
" if thou had hitt me as thou had ment,  
thou had raught me a ffell dint. `[Pork. MS. puts Gawaine's supper after this, and brings the Carle's daughter in to harp and sing to them.

they carle tooke Gawaine by the hand,  
& both into a Chamber they wend ;

the carles wiffe therin was laid :  

`[and bids him get in and kiss her, but do nothing more. Gawaine does so and thinks to do more, but the Carle stops him, and takes him to his daughter's bed, and tells him to get into it. Gawaine does so, and the Carle goes away, locking the door. Next morning, he calls Gawaine,]`

the carles said, "Gawaine, of curtesye  
gett into this bedd w^'th this ffaire Ladye.  
kisse thou her 3se before mine eye ;  
looke thou. doe no other villanye."  
the carle opened the sheetes wyde ;  
Gawaine gott in by the Laydes syde ;  
Gawaine oner her `[he. — Madden. ]` put his arme ;  
with that his flesh began to warme :  
Gawaine had thought to haue made in ffare, `[free. q. — Pencil note. ]`  
" hold," q^oth the carle, " man, stopp there `[MS. thee.— F.]` !  
itt were great shame," quoth they carle, " for me  
that thou sholdest doe me such villanye ;  
but arise vp, Gawaine, & goe with me,  
I shall bring thee to a ffairer Lady then euer was shee."  
they `[the.— P.]` carle tooke Gawaine by the hand ; `[Pork. MS. makes the Carle send his daughter to Gawaine, ib. p. 201 — F.]`  
both into another Chamber they wend ;  
a ffaire bedd there found they spred,  
and the Carles daughter therin Laid :  
saith, " Gawaine, now for thy curtesye  
gett thee to bedd to this ffaire Lady."  
the carle opened the sheetes wyde,  
Sir Gawaine gott in by the Ladyes side.  
Gawaine put his arme ouer that sweet thing ;  
" sleepe, daughter," sais the carle, " on my blessing."  
they carle turned his backe & went his way,  
& lockt the dore with a siluer Kaye.  
on the other morning `[In the next m.—P.]` when the carles rose,  
vnto his daughters chamber he goes :  
" rise vp, Sir Gawaine, & goe with mee,  
a maruelous sight I shall lett thee see."  
they carle tooke him by the hand,  
& both into another chamber they wend,  

`[and shows him bloody shirts and 1500 dead men's bones, slain by him, the Carle. Gawaine wants to take leave, but the Carle makes him stop to dinner. After it he shows Gawaine a sword, and begs him to cut his (the Carle's) head off. Gawaine refuses, whereupon the Carle says he'll cut his head off if he don't do it. So Gawaine cuts the Carle's head off, and he]`

& there they found many `[One stroke too few in the MS. — F.]` a bloody serke

they found vpon a rooke `[i. e. a ruck, a heap. — P.]` att once,

saith, " I & my welpes haue slaine all there."  
then Sir Gawaine curteous and kind, `[hend, q. — Pencil note.]`  
he tooke his leaue away to wend,  
& thanked they carle & the Ladyes there,  
right as they worthy were.  
"nay," said the carle, "wee will first dine,  
& then thou shalt goe with blessing mine. `[Only half the m in the MS. Madden reads mine too. — F.]` "  
after dinner, the sooth to say,  
the carle tooke Gawaine to a Chamber gay  
where were hanginge swords towe `[rowe. — Madden.]` ;  
the Carle soone tooke one of tho,  
& sayd to the Knight then,  
" Gawaine, as thou art a man,  
take this sword & stryke of my head."  
" Nay," said Gawaine, " I had rather be dead ;  
ffor I had rather suffer pine & woe

till a Knight of the round table `[I would read : by Nigromance thus was I bound, till a Knight of the table round.— Skeat.]`  
had with a sword smitten `[MS. snitten.— F.]` of my head,  
if he had grace to doe that deede.  
itt is 40 winters agoe  
since I was transformed soe ;  
since then, none Lodged within this wooun, `[Madden reads woom, and notes woone ? — F.]`  
but I & my whelpes driuen them downe ;  
& but if hee did my bidding soone,  
I killed him & drew him downe,  
euery one but only thee.  
Christ grant thee of his mercye !  
he that the world made, reward thee this !  
ffor all my bale thou hast turned to blisse.  
now will I leaue that Lawe ;  
there shall no man ffor me `[i. e. thro' me. — P.]` be slawe,  
& I purpose ffor their sake  
a chantrey in this place to make,  
& 5 preists to sing ffor aye  
vntill itt be doomes day.  
& Gawaine, for the loue of thee

Sir Gawaine & the young Lady clere,  
the Bishopp weded `[wedded. — Madden.]` them in ffere ;  

`[stands up a proper man, and thanks Gawaine for delivering him from the witchcraft that 40 years ago transformed him, so to be till a Knight of the Round Table should cut his head off. " Christ reward you! Henceforth I'll kill no one; but every body shall be welcome to me." The Bishop marries Gawaine and ]`

`[the Carle's daughter. The Carle gives Kay a blood-red steed, and Gawaine's lady a white palfrey. Then he bids Gawaine go to Arthur and ask him to dine with him next day.

ffor his loue that Iudas sold,  
& for his sake that in BETHELEM was borne, —  
that hee wold dine with him to morne."  
Sir Gawaine sayd the carle vnto,  
" fforssooth I shall your message doe."  
then they rode singing by the way  
with the Ladye that was gay ;  
they were as glad of that Lady bright  
as euer was ffowle of the day-Lyght.  
they told King Arthur where they had beene,  
& what aduentures they had scene.  
" I thanke god," sayd the "King, " cozen Kay,

"Marry," sayd Sir Kay againe,  
" of my liffe `[lifte, MS., says Madden.— F.]` I may be ffaine.

TH NOTES:

King Arthur and men had been out hunting, 500 deer and more had been killed.

Sir Gawain, Sir Kay and Bishop Baldwin chased a reindeer from mid-morning to late afternoon

Horn sounded to end the hunt, but continued, magic forest of Inglewood??? Deer disappeared, needed accommodation. Let's sleep under tree said Gawain. Sir Kay wanted to find lodgings. Bishop knew a place - Carle of Carlisle, lived in a nearby castle. THough he'd heard knights who stayed their only got out with a beating, if at all. Kay is up for it, to give as good as he gets.

Gawain is sure they can do it nicely.

Knokc at gates, scene with porter: Gawain nice, Kay up for a fight, porter telling them they'll all be sorry.

Brought in, shocked to see 4 wild animals round the fire: a bull, a boar, a lion and a bear. The Carle treated them like dogs as thy got up and snappd at the knights and the Bishop.

Carle was a giant - two yards across and 9 yards tall. No pillar supported the root thicker than his thighs.

Gawain bowed, the Carle said no niceties, he was not a Lord, the courtesy would be rough and ready. Get wine, sent his cup back when it was too small, wanted a large cup, holding 9 gallons, held in one hand.

Bishop went out to check his horse, eating straw next to a huge colt; he slapped the colt to send it awy from his horse, giant asked wtf? and that he'd give Bishop a slap - "but i'm a Bishop, a man of god". WHo has no respect, thwack... and knocked Bishop unconscious.

Sir Kay came out, found his horse next to the colt, slapped it on the flank, giant saw this, knocked him unconscious to th ground.

After a while they returned, Gawain asked where they've been: "checking the horses", running their heads.

Gawain asked to do the same, saw the colt outside in the rain, took it inside, saying it was his masters not theirs. The Carle thankd him.

Food was brought. The Bishop tucked straight in. Sir Kay sat by the beautiful wife of the Carle and started eyeing and chatting her up ("What's a lovely girl like you doing with a brute like him" etc) as the Carle glared at him. Gawain waited politely to be invited to sit.

The Carle asked him to do something for him - throw a spear at his head. Do it... Gawain did, threw the spear so quickly - sparks behind the head of the Carle on the wall. Gawain didn't usually miss - how had the Carle dodged it? The Carle thanked him, sat him opposite his wife. He was taken in by her beauty, the Carle said his desire was pointless She was his wife. Do not think more of her. Gawain blushed.

Carle's daughter called for, pretty, beautifully and expensively dressed. "Where is your harp?" the finest harp, and she played a beautiful tune, sang a song about th exploits of Arthur.

Comfortable, but simple rooms were found for Kay and the Bishop, Gawain was shown to the Carle's bedchamber and told he should make himself comfortable there. THen the Carle's wife came in and Gawain was told to kiss her while the Carle watched. Gawain did as asked, kissed her again, their embrace got more intimate "Whoa" said the Carle, but you did as I asked. So you will not go unrewarded, And he sent for his daughter and said Gawain may spend the night with her.

Kay and the Bishop were up early, and Kay was all for leaving, but the Bishop said they should wait for Gawain (it's all a bit Top Gear / Grand Tour, Clarkson, Hammond and May).

The Carle had got up early too, checking preparations for breakfast; the bell was rung for mass, and dutiful Gawain got up to go, asking when he would see the Carle's daughter again.

After Mass, Gawain made to go, but the Carle said "stay for breakfast".

> " Twenty winters have passed now, since I made a vow before God, one that has brought me much discredit. I made a pledge that no man should spend the night in my castle unless he did everything I asked him to do, or else he should be slain. Knight, page, earl or squire, I have never found a single man able to survive this pledge, except for you. May God reward you! I am delighted! Through the grace of Mary, Queen of Heaven, my sorrow is turned to joy!’"

Carle showed Gawain a building filled with dead men's bones, the ground blood stained. "I did this with my animals".

Gawain invited in for breakfast, and Bishop and Kay. Bishop was given a mitre, a ring and a gold cloth, Kay a war horse. Gawain, his daughter, a riding horse, and a pack horse laden down with gold.

Gawain sent with the Carle's blessing, and his daughter.

Arthur relieved to see them; Kay told him the Carle wanted to dine with him. Fabulous banquet, Arthur made him a knight of the round table, Knight of Carlisle.

Carlisle then had an abbey built, and the souls of the men he had killd were evermore prayed for.

c. 1550?

> Arthur and his court are staying in Wales. The king requests Bishop Baldwin to say a mass and then sets out with his knights to hunt. Gawain, Kay and Baldwin become separated from the group and decide to seek shelter in the castle of the Carle of Carlisle, who is well known for mistreating his guests. Kay threatens to repay any ill-treatment with violence, but Gawain insists that they behave courteously. He covers up Kay’s rudeness to the porter, and they stable their horses before entering the hall. Their host is a hideous giant, but Gawain greets him politely and he welcomes the knights, reminding them, however, of his animosity to Arthur. The Carle calms his pets (a bear, a boar, a bull and a lion) and his beautiful wife appears, sitting on his knee and singing songs about love: Gawain politely compliments her, but the Carle admonishes him for thinking of 'villainy'.
>
> One by one the knights leave the hall to check on their horses. Kay and Baldwin both turn the Carle’s own palfrey out of his stable, and are rewarded for their discourteous behaviour with violent buffets from their host. Gawain, however, covers the horse with his cloak and is thanked courteously. Back in the hall, the Carle calls for an enormous cup of wine, and they all drink.
>
> As they dine, the Carle bids Gawain throw a spear at him. The knight obeys with such force that, when the Carle ducks, it shatters against the wall. He then leads Gawain to a chamber where his wife is lying in bed, instructing him to kiss her three times but go no further. Gawain complies and becomes aroused, but his host stops the knight and leads him to his daughter’s chamber, ushering him into her bed and locking the door. In the morning, the Carl shows Gawain the bloody armour and bones of his former victims, then when the knight politely attempts to leave, insists that he stay for another meal. Afterwards, he presents Gawain with a sword and tells him to cut off his head. Gawain obeys and the Carle is transformed into a normal man. He thanks Gawain for breaking a curse that has lasted forty years, promising to found a chantry for his victims and welcome all future guests. Baldwin marries Gawain to the Carle’s daughter, and their host presents them with rich gifts, begging them to invite Arthur to dine with him. The king agrees, and the following day they all return to the Carle’s castle, which has been decorated for a lavish feast. The Carle promises to treat the king with 'great courtesy', and Arthur is so pleased that he knights the Carle before returning to his court.
