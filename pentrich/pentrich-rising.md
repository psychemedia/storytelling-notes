# Pentrich Rising

```text
I bring you a tale, 
Of treason, and lies.  
Gather round for my story:  
Of rebels, and spies.
```

It's December, 1816, and revolt is in the air. The impoverished masses are clamouring for state aid and Parliamentary Reform. A large rally is held in London, peaceful for the most part, but then, a riot: warrants, and later, rewards, are issued against the leaders of the supposed insurrection; arrests are later made. The date for the State Trial, for High Treason no less, is set for June.

Around the country, secret gatherings, meetings and mutterings. Parliamentary reform; state aid; the people are suffering, and want representation; the people are suffering, and need help.

From the Midland counties of Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire to the West Riding of Yorkshire, a tall, fair-headed, red-whiskerd and well-dressed man attends many of the meetings. Bringing news: of sentiment in London, of the planned actions elsewhere around the country. A certain Mr William Oliver. His conversations with two local committees are notable: in Huddersfield, and in Nottingham. The story is the same: as the State Trial begins in London, there will be an insurrection, and a march to the metroplis. Weapons will be required, but the garrisons will be quickly captured and rendered ineffective. No blood will be spilled. Debts will be relieved, industries nationalised, and politics reformed. The date is set: Sunday, June 8th, 1817.

In Huddersfield, two dozen men meet at Folly Hall Bridge and in Honley, armed and ready to march. But it seems that somehow the Magistrates and the Yeomanry knew what was likely to be afoot. It seems almost as if they had been forewarned. In the early hours of Monday morning, a shot is fired at the local Yeomanry, and a horse is hit. The ball of shot is removed, and I believe the horse recovered. No animals were harmed, at least, not mortally, during this part of the action. The insurrectionists are disbursed and several persons apprehended.

Over the coming days and weeks the men are interviewed, and set to appear at the Assizes in York, scene of a Special Commission five years earlier that saw 15 men, Luddites from the Huddersfield area, sentenced to death in a special and promptly hanged.

But in a local newspaper, the Leeds Mercury, a story has broken: a spy, William Oliver, claiming to be a Parliamentary reformer, well-connected with other reformers in London, has been touring the organising committees of the North and promoting insurrection. Questions are asked in Parliament. Entrapment is claimed. There is public uproar — this is public service investigate journalism at its best. The men at York are acquitted.

So too, in the State Trials in London, where the claimed organisers of insurrection in London six months before are acquitted.

But in Pentrich, on the Derbyshire / Yorkshire border, a different story plays out. There, too, William Oliver had encouraged discontent, had encouraged co-ordinated action, had promoted a June 8th uprising.

Fifty men had set out from Pentrich, intending to take part in a co-ordinated raid on the nearby Butterley Iron Works to steal arms and munitions, and then to make their way to Nottingham, and London, building numbers all the while.

But it seems that the magistrates and the Yeomanry knew what was likely to be afoot. It seems almost as if they had been forewarned. The men left the ironworks and headed towards Nottingham. The numbers grew, to 500 or so, but by now the authorities had the evidence they needed, and the insurrectionists were disbursed. The leaders, identified by who knows what intelligence, were later arrested. At the local assizes, they are summoned to appear before a Special Commission to be held in the Autumn on the charge of High Treason. Four in particular accused of being the leaders. Or perhaps, make that three, Because one of the leaders, who had avoided action on the night in question, and who had been the contact man for a certain Mr William Oliver, was treated differently. It would not do for *his* evidence to come before the jurors, let alone the public.

During the trial, a press blackout was in force, although contemporaneous reports of the proceedings were to appear after the trial. Outside the court, graffiti'd messages to the jurors daub the courthouse wall: "Jurymen – remember Oliver!"

By the end of the trial, the three leaders, and sundry others, were found guilty of High Treason. For the leaders, a sentence of hanging, drawing and quartering. For the others, just hanging, although in a 19th century style plea bargain, that was commuted to deportation.

For three leaders — Jeremiah Brandreth, William Turner & Isaac Ludlam — they also received clemency of a sort, from the Prince Regent: their bodies would not be quartered.

And so it was, just after midday, Friday November 7th, the three prisoners were paraded round the prison yard in Derby, where they were hung from the scaffold using the short drop method to ensure a slow, lingering death by stangulation. For half an hour they hung there, whereupon their bodies were taken down, one at a time, placed upon a block, and decaptitated with an axe.  In turn, their heads were lifted up by the executiner and shown to the stunned, silent crowd: "Behold the head of the traitor".

Later that afternoon, their bodies were dumped in an unmarked grave.

And that is the story of the Pentrich Uprising.

Pentrich Rising, Ferocious Dog

Oh my name is William Turner and my tale I'll tell to thee
about the revolution in 1817
With Brandreth and Ludlam and a band of fifty strong
With hundreds more to meet us
on the road, as we march on

A night for revolution, a night to fight
A call to arms in England
All workers must unite
Tonight we march on Pentrich
with London in our sights
A night for revolution
All workers must unite
And then we fight

Little did we know there was a traitorous government spy
William J. Oliver a man I now despise
The Pentrich revolution was always doomed to fail
For high treason, I was sentenced and hung in Derby Gaol

A night for revolution a night to fight
A call to arms in England
All workers must unite
Tonight we march on Pentrich
with London in our sights
A night for revolution
All workers must unite
And then we fight
