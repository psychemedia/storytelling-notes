# Macpherson's Rant

*I first came across this story whilst searching for traditional gipsy fiddler stories. My first attempt is a rather literal telling that combines  several historical accounts, which all seem to differ in various ways. I try to retain the essence of the story whilst tying up loose ends or rather clunky bits that appear in some accounts.*

> James, or Jamie, Macpherson was the bastard son of a Scottish laird, born to a gypsy mother but brought up in his father's household. He was strong, a forceful character, and a gifted musician: many was the night when the young James Macpherson would dazzle the ceilidh with his violin playing.
>
> All things must come to an end, however, and when his father died, the estate went the way of a more, shall we say, legitimate claim, and Jamie took to the hills, to the gypsy life that was in his blood.
>
> These were hard times for gypsies, though, the Scottish travellers, the Scottish Romanies, the "Egyptians": harried, untolerated, persecuted, even, much as they are to this day. They were also seen as lawbreakers, *sorners*, people who would camp without permission in empty farmers' barns and outhouses that dotted the wild landscape. But Jamie's band were honourable, or so it is said, and if you spent the evening with Jamie and his men, you could guarantee he'd keep everyone entertained with his fiddle playing.
>
> Tradition has it that Jamie and his band of followers were the Scottish equivalent of Robin Hood and his Merry Men, but I don't know about that: you'd have to ask his clansmen. But it does seem as if he had good nature, and that it contributed to his downfall.
>
>I'm not sure how he was arrested the first time....
>
> Perhaps it was following the night when he stopped his men raiding a house — and they would only raid the houses and farms of wealthy men, sharing their spoils with the those in need of them — when the master of the house was burying his wife and child — it would be wrong to exploit such a time of grief; one of the gang took issue with giving up on such easy pickings and informed the local Sherriff as to Jamies' whereabouts...
>
> Or maybe it was the tale I heard tell that one night he heard a frightened scream coming from the farmhouse near where he was camping; that he and his men raced to the cottage, that they found Lord Braco there, molesting the daughter of the house: surely, he set about Braco, and sent him and his men on their way with their tails between their legs; some say that Jamie Macpherson then wooed and fell in love with that fair maiden, others that as a result of that night, Braco raised a warrant for Jamie's arrest, for sorning, and for being an "Egyptian", which is to say, a gypsy.
>
> Whether Macpherson actually waylaid the messenger and stole the warrant, or whether the summons was delivered to the Sheriff, Jamie just seemed to grow and grow in confidence. At one point, he announced he would take a procession into Aberdeen, led by his piper ahead of him. This was no doubt a flagrant act of protest, of sticking two fingers up at the magisterial authorities; but it seems they authorities were better prepared than Jamie had expected, because he was captured, and imprisoned.
>
> But his merry men — if you could ever imagine a band of huge, great, sword wielding, hairy Scottish gypsy warriors being described as "merry men" — came to his rescue: one retrieved his sword, another outwitted the jailer and freed Jamie Macpherson. In the course of the escape, a local butcher, who also topped up his wages by acting as the local hangman, tried to apprehend Jamie, leaping stunt man style from an upstairs window and landing on top of him. Seeing his trusty dog nearby, the butcher called to the dog — "get him, kill him" — but with lightning quick presence of mind, Jamie's accomplice threw his plaid — you know, his tartan shawl — over the butcher, and so confused the dog that the dog then started mauling his covered master.
>
> And so it was, Jamie returned to the hills, making occasional raids, staying, or sorning, wherever the road took him. Until he was captured again.
>
> This time, there was to be no escape, even though you might argue that no escape was necessary. Because even though Braco, recalling his previous warrant for arrest, would have Jamie judged by the Laird of that place, a kinsman of Jamie, and sentenced to death by a landowner's right, others would argue that the jurisdiction lay elsewhere. Indeed, after lobbying by Jamie's cousin — remember, Jamie was the son of a laird jhimself, even if an illegitimate one — a reprieve from that sentence was granted by the Sheriff... But...  somehow...  Braco managed to hear of it.
>
> And even though the time for the execution had been set... well, Braco couldn't risk it. The messenger with the reprieve would surely been on his way by now, he might arrive at any time...  and so, Braco had the hands of the clock of that place moved forwards, hastening the allotted time of execution.
>
> Macpherson was led out to the gallows.
>
> He asked for one last request — that he be allowed to play a tune on his trusty fiddle — and the wish was granted.
>
> Taking his trusty fiddle in hand, he played a tune of his own composition, a tune known variously today as Macpherson's Rant, or Macpherson's Lament.
>
> He looked around at the assembled audience, haunted looks as they realised this hero's days were surely at an end, and perhaps thankful that they were not up on the gallows with with him. "Who will take my fiddle? Who will play for me at my wake?" Silence. No-one dared risked being seen as an accomplice of Jamie Macpherson. And with that he gave a cry of anger, snapping the violin in two and towing it into the crowd. The noose was placed around his neck... But then, perhaps even as the messenger, with his reprieve, approached, Jamie Macpherson threw himself off the step to his death: no man would be able to say they had hung Jamie Macpherson.
>
> The violin, well, the violin, and Jamie's huge sword, I believe they can still be seen, to this day, in a small museum in Banff, in North-East Scotland.  And in that town of Banff, from where Jamie was hung, well, the lairdship was stripped of its manorial right of managing trial and punishment. And in the town of Macduff, just over the estuary, I have heard said the facing wall of the clock tower there is blanked off; for the people of Macduff have not given the people of Banff, the time of day ever since that fateful day of November 16th, 1700, when Jamie Macpherson played his final lament.

HISTORICAL TALES AND LEGENDS OF THE HIGHLANDS.

COMPILED BY

ALEXANDER MACKENZIE

1878

JAMES MACPHERSON, THE FAMOUS MUSICIAN & FREEBOOTER.

The story of James Macpherson is one which has induced much curiosity and inquiry, and, short as the time is since he was done to death, shows how soon facts may become garbled and altered in complexion. Sir Walter Scott, for instance, makes Inverness the closing scene of the proceedings. That he was wrong is clearly shown by the records of the Sheriff Court of Banff.

James Macpherson was the illegitimate son of Macpherson of Invereshie, by a beautiful gipsy girl who attracted his notice at a wedding.

He acknowledged the child, and reared him in his own house until he lost his life in pursuing a hostile clan to recover a spreach of cattle taken from Badenoch.

Macpherson, who had grown in beauty, strength, and stature rarely equalled, then took his place in the clan, with the chief's blood flowing in his veins, as a young Highland freebooter, who, in descending from the mountains with his followers, believed he was only asserting the independence of his tribe, and when they harried the Lowlands was only taking a lawful prey. Such acts were not, in the opinion of the "pretty men" of those times, to be confounded with pitiful thieving and stealing, but considered as deeds of spirit and boldness calculated to make a man famous in his country side and among his fellows.

Macpherson excelled in love as in war, and was the best fiddle player and the best swordsman of his name. Tradition asserts that, if it must [Pg 26] be owned that his prowess was debased by the exploits of a freebooter, no act of cruelty, no robbery of the widow, the fatherless, or the distressed, and no murder were ever perpetrated under his command or by his knowledge.

His sword and shield are still preserved at Duff House, a residence of the Earl of Fife. The sword is one which none but a man of uncommon strength could wield. It is two-handed, six feet in length, and the blade nearly as broad as a common scythe. The shield is of wood, covered with bull's hide, and studded with brass nails, and is both hacked and perforated in many places, telling a tale of many a hard fought fight. Tradition also asserts that he often gave the spoils of the rich to relieve the poor, and that his followers were restrained from many atrocities of rapine by the awe of his mighty arm.

Indeed, it is said that a dispute with a foiled and savage member of his tribe, who wished to rob a gentleman's house while his wife and two children lay on the bier for interment, was the cause of his first being betrayed within the power of the law. From this toil he escaped, to the vexation of the magistrates of Aberdeen, who bribed a girl of that city, of whom Macpherson was very fond, to allure and deliver him again into their hands, under pretence of hearing his wonderful performances on the violin.

No sooner did the frantic girl understand the true state of the case than she made known, through a tribe of gipsies, the chief of whom was Peter Brown, a notorious vagrant, the capture of Macpherson to his comrades, when his cousin, Donald Macpherson, a gentleman of herculean powers, came from Badenoch in order to join the gipsy, Brown, in liberating the prisoner. On a market day they brought several assistants, and swift horses were stationed at convenient distances. There was a platform before the jail covering the door below. Donald Macpherson and Peter Brown forced the jail, and while Peter Brown went to help the heavily fettered prisoner, James Macpherson, in moving away, Donald Macpherson guarded the jail door with a drawn sword. Many persons assembled at the market had experienced James Macpherson's humanity or shared his bounty in the past, and they crowded round the jail as if in mere curiosity, but, in fact, to obstruct the civil authorities in their attempt to prevent a rescue. A butcher, however, was resolved to detain Macpherson, expecting a large recompense from the magistrates. He sprung up the stairs, and leaped from the platform upon Donald Macpherson, whom he dashed to the ground by the force and weight of his body. Donald soon resolved to make a desperate resistance, and the combatants in their struggle tore off each other's clothes. The butcher got a glimpse of his dog upon the platform, and called him to his aid, but Macpherson with admirable presence of mind snatched up his own plaid, which lay near, and threw it over the butcher, thus misleading the instinct of his canine adversary. The dog darted with fury upon the plaid and terribly lacerated his master's thigh. In the meantime, James Macpherson had been carried out by Peter Brown, and was soon joined by Donald Macpherson, who was quickly covered by some friendly spectators with a bonnet and greatcoat. The magistrates ordered webs from the shops to be drawn across the Gallowgate, but Donald cut them with his sword, and James, the late prisoner, got off on horseback.

Some time after he was brought into fatal companionship with gipsies, by the same power which led the old Grecian hero to change his club for a distaff. The Highlander fell in love with a gipsy girl, and with one companion, James Gordon, who eventually paid the penalty with him, he entered for a time into the roving company of the gipsy band. The Banffshire gentlemen, whom Macpherson had plundered of old, heard with delight that the most dreaded of their enemies had come almost unprotected into their boundaries.

According to the evidence on the trial, he seems to have joined the gipsies on a rioting rather than on a plundering excursion in Keith market, when he fell into the hands of his watchful foes, the chief of whom was Duff of Braco. He was immediately thrown into prison, and brought to trial with three persons, Peter Brown, Donald Brown, and James Gordon, his companions, indited by the Procurator-Fiscal as "Egyptians or gipsies, and vagabonds; and sorners, and robbers, and known habit and repute guilty of theft, masterful bangstree, riot, and oppression."

When brought into Court at Banff the Laird of Grant attempted to rescue them from the claims of the law, by asserting his right to try them as being dwellers within the regality of Grant, over which he had the power of pit and gallows.

The Sheriff, Nicholas Dunbar of Castlefield, however, over-ruled the claim, and sustaining himself as judge, ordered a jury to try the prisoners on the next day. This was accordingly done, when they were found guilty and condemned, more apparently from a bad name, than from any immediate crimes of which they had been guilty.

The Sheriff passing over the two Browns, the captain of the gipsy band and his brother, sentenced Macpherson and Gordon to death, causing them to be taken from the Court to the Tolbooth of Banff, from which eight days afterwards they were to be conveyed to the gallows hill of Banff, and hanged by the neck to the death on gibbets erected there. This hurried sentence shows the influence which the fear of Macpherson, or private enmity, exercised [Pg 29]over the minds of Dunbar, the Sheriff, and the jury, and hints at the influence exercised by Braco Duff upon Sheriff, jury, and magistrates, especially as the Browns, his companions, were not sentenced; in fact, they lay in jail for a year, and afterwards made their escape from prison.

Macpherson was an admirable performer on the violin, and the ardent love for music was a fit ingredient in the character of one who could so idly risk his life in the pursuit of romantic love. His musical talent was evinced long before his capture in the composition of a pibroch that goes by his name; and he is said also to have composed the words and music, which, in his last moments, he gave to the world under the name of "Macpherson's Farewell"—

My father was a gentleman  
Of fame and lineage high,  
Oh! mother, would you ne'er had born  
A wretch so doomed to die!  
But dantonly and wantonly  
And rantonly I'll gae,  
I'll play a tune and dance it roun'  
Below the gallows tree.

The Laird o' Grant with power aboon  
The royal majesty,  
He pled fu' well for Peter Brown  
But let Macpherson die.  
But dantonly, &c.

But Braco Duff, in rage enough,  
He first laid hands on me;  
If death did not arrest my course,  
Avenged I should be.  
But dantonly, &c.

I've led a life o' meikle strife,  
Sweet peace ne'er smiled on me,  
It grieves me sair that I maun gae  
An' na avenged be.  
But dantonly, &c.  

The verses of the song above given represent him as a musician, and as determined to display, which he certainly did, a mood of recklessness such as the boldest felon seldom evinces when below the fatal tree. Burns on his tour through the Highlands, it is very probable learned both the air and the tradition connected with it, and it may be that while composing, what Lockhart calls a grand lyric, he had Macpherson's words in his mind. Burns has written—

Sae rantonly, sae wantonly,  
Sae dauntingly gaed he,  
He played a spring and danced it round  
Below the gallows tree.

I've lived a life of sturt and strife  
I die by treacherie,  
It burns my heart I must depart  
And not avenged be.

Now farewell light thou sunshine bright,  
And all beneath the sky,  
May coward shame disdain his name  
The wretch that dares not die.

Sae rantingly, sae wantonly,  
Sae dauntingly gaed he,  
He played a spring and danced it round  
Below the gallows tree.  

On the eighth day after his trial he was brought with his companion, Gordon, to the foot of the fatal tree, several hours before the time specified in the sentence for his execution.

It is said that his death was hurried on by the Magistrates, and that they also caused the messenger intrusted with a reprieve to be stopped by the way, in consequence of which acts of injustice it is alleged the town of Banff was deprived of the power of trying and executing malefactors.

When the freebooter came to the foot of the gallows tree in presence of the spectators who had come to witness his untimely end, he played with the utmost pathos the fine tune, "Macpherson's Farewell," which he had previously composed.

When he had finished he asked if he had any friend in the crowd to whom a last gift of his violin would be acceptable on condition of his playing the same tune over his body at his lyke wake. No one had the hardihood to claim friendship with one in whose crimes the acknowledgment might imply a participation, and the freebooter saying that the instrument had been his solace in many a gloomy hour, and that it should now perish with him, broke it over his knee, and, scattering the fragments among the crowd, immediately flung himself off the ladder.

Thus died James Macpherson, who, if he was a freebooter, possessed the heart of an errant knight. Donald Macpherson, his relative and friend, picked up the neck of the violin which is still preserved in the family of Cluny, Chief of the Macphersons. One thing is certain amid all the traditions which have come down regarding this bold and singular robber; his strength and stature far exceeded those of common men; and this was proved, when his grave was opened some years ago, by the examination of his bones.

### Domestic Annals of Scotland

The *Domestic Annals of Scotland: from the Revolution to the Rebellion of 1745* was a three volume work by Robert Chambers and published between 1858 and 1861 by William and Robert Chambers. The history of James Macpherson is related in [https://archive.org/details/domesticannalsof03chamiala/page/232/mode/2up?q=macpherson], p233-237.

...

Nov. 16, 1700

A band of persons, usually called Egyptians or gipsies, used  to go about the province of Moray in armed fashion, helping themselves freely to the property of the settled population, and ordinainly sleeping in kilns near the farmhouses. There seems to have been thirty of them in all, men and women ; but it was seldom that more than eight or ten made their appearance in any one place. It was quite a familiar sight, at a fair or market in Banff, Elgin, Forres, or any other town of the district, to see nearly a dozen sturdy Egyptians march in with a piper playing at their head, their matchlocks slung behind them, and their broad-swords or dirks by their sides, to mingle in the crowd, inspect the cattle shewn for sale, and watch for bargains passing among individuals, in order to learn who was in the way of receiving money. They would be viewed with no small suspicion and dislike by the assembled rustics and farmers ; but the law was unable to put them entirely down.

James Macpherson, who was understood to be the natural son of a gentleman of the district by a gipsy mother, was a conspicuous or leading man in the band ; he was a person of goodly figure and great strength and daring, always carrying about with him — how acquired we cannot tell — an example of the two-handed swords of a former age, besides other weapons. He had a talent for music, and was a good player on the violin. It has been stated that some traits of a generous nature occasionally shone out in him ; but, on the whole, he was merely a Highland cateran, breaking houses and henroosts, stealing horses and cattle, and living recklessly on the proceeds, like the tribe with which he associated.

[Illustration of Macpherson's Sword.]

Duff, Laird of Braco, founder of the honours and wealth of the Earls of Fife, took a lead at this time in the public affairs of his district. He formed the resolution of trying to give a check to the lawless proceedings of the Egyptians, by bringing their leaders to justice. It required some courasre to face such determined ruffians with arms in their hands, and he had a further difficulty in the territorial i7oo, prejudices of the Laird of Grant, who regarded some of the robbers as his tenants, and felt bound, accordingly, to protect them from any jurisdiction besides his own. `[Alexander Duff was descended from a race of gentry in Morayshire — the Duffs of Muldavit — and it seems to have been by saving, prudence, and good management that he was enabled to increase his share of the ftimily possessions, and so far advance the prospects of his house, that it was ennobled in the nest generation, and now ranks among tho eight or ten families of highest wealth in Scotland. There is a characteristic story about Braco surveying one day an extensive tract of country containing several tolerable lairdships, when, seeing the houses in various directions all giving out signs of being inhabited by their respective families, he said : ' A' that reek sail come out o' ae lum yet ! ' and he made good his word by ultimately buying up the whole of that district.]` This remark bears particularly upon two named Peter and Donald Brown, who had lived for half a year at a place closely adjacent to Castle-Grant, and the former of whom was regarded as captain of the band.

Finding Macpherson, the Browns, and others at the 'Summer's Eve Fair in Keith, the stout-hearted Braco made up his mind to attack them. To pursue a narrative which appears to be authentic : ' As soon as he observed them in the fair, he desired his brother-in-law, Lesmurdie, to bring him a dozen stout men, which he did. They attacked the villains, who, as they had several of their accomplices with them, made a desperate resistance. One of them made a pass at Braco with his hanger, intending to run him through the heart; but it slanted along the outside of the ribs, and one of his men immediately stabbed the fellow dead. They then carried Macpherson and [Peter] Brown to a house in Keith, and set three or four stout men to guard them, not expecting any more opposition, as all the rest of the gang were fled. Braco and Lesmurdie were sitting in au upper room, concerting the commitment of their prisoners, when the Laird of Grant and thirty men came calling for them, swearing no DuflPin Scotland should keep them from him. Braco, hearing the noise of the Grants, came down stairs, and said, with seeming unconcern and humour: "That he designed to have sent them to prison ; but he saw they were too strong a party for him to contend with, and so he must leave them;" but, without losing a moment, he took a turn through the market, found other two justices of peace, kept a court, and assembled sixty stout fellows, with whom he retook the two criminals, and sent them to prison.' `[The above narration appeared in the *Dumfries Journal* (newspaper).]`

1700.

James Macpherson, the two Browns, and James Gordon, were brought before the sheriff of Banffshire at Banff, on the 7th of November 1700, charged with ' being habit and repute Egyptians and vagabonds, and keeping the markets in their ordinary manner of thieving and purse-cutting ' . . . . being guilty also of ' masterful bangstrie and oppression.' A procurator appeared on the part of the young Laird of Grant, demanding surrender of the two Browns, to be tried in the court of his regality, within whose bounds they had lived, and offering a *culreach* or pledge for them; `[The system of culreach or repledgiation was one of great antiquity in Scotland, but last heard of in the Highlands. So lately as 1698, George Earl of Cromarty obtained a charter, giving him this among other powers : If any of the indwellers and tenants of his lands should happen ' to be arrested or attached before any judge or judges, spiritual or temporal, in any time coming, to repledge and call them back to the privilege and liberty of the said court of bailiery and regality of Tarbat.']` but the demand was overruled, on the ground that the Browns had never been truly domiciliated there. Witnesses were adduced, who detailed many felonies of the prisoners. They had stolen sheep, oxen, and horses ; they had broken into houses, and taken away goods; they had robbed men of their purses, and tyrannously oppressed many poor people. It was shewn that the band was in the habit of speaking a peculiar language. They often spent whole nights in dancing and debauchery, Peter Brown or Macpherson giving animation to the scene by the strains of the violin. An inhabitant of Keith related how Macpherson came to his house one day, seeking for him, when, not finding him, he stabbed the bed, to make sure he was not there, and, on going away, set the ale-barrel aflowing. The jury gave a verdict against all the four prisoners ; but sentence was for the meantime passed upon only Macpherson and Gordon, adjudging them to be hanged next market-day. `[Documents of the process in Spalding Club Miscellany, iii, 175.]`

Macpherson spent the last hours of his life in composing a tune expressive of the reckless courage with which he regarded his fate. He marched to the place of execution, a mile from the town, playing this air on his violin. He even danced to it under the fatal tree. Then he asked if any one in the crowd would accept his fiddle, and keep it as a memorial of Macpherson ; and finding no one disposed to do so, he broke the instrument over his knee, and threw himself indignantly from the ladder. Such was the life and death of a man of whom one is tempted to think that, with such qualities as he possessed, he might, in a happier age, have risen to some better distinction than that which unfortunately he has attained.

Burns's fine ode on Macpherson will be remembered :

Sae rantingly, sae wantony,  
Sae dantonly gaed he,  
He played a spring and danced it round,  
Beneath the gallows tree.

There was, however, an earlier celebration of the robber's hardihood on a broadside, a copy of which will be found in Herd's *Collection of Scottish Songs* (1776). See also a curious volume, entitled *Scottish Ballads and Songs* (Edinburgh, T. G. Stevenson, 1859).

A long two-handed sword is shewn in Duff House, the seat of the Earl of Fife, as that of Macpherson. It is a formidable weapon, 4 feet 3 inches long, and having a wavy-edged blade. It is obvioiisly a mediaeval weapon, yet, of course, may have been used in a later age.

March 4, 1701. — There was a petition to the Privy Council from Peter and Donald Brown, prisoners in the Tolbooth of Banff, representing that they had been condemned solely as 'repute vagabond Egyptians,' to bo hanged on the 2d April. They claimed a longer day, 'either for their relief or due preparation;' and the Lords granted reprieve till the second Wednesday of June.

## Genealogical Memoirs of the Duffs

One of the earliest accounts of the Macpherson tale comes, rather interestingly, from the perspective of Macpherson's nemesis, the family Duff. Although it was wasnlt until November, 1869 that [Genealogical Memoirs of the Duffs](https://archive.org/details/genealogicalmemo1869bair) was first published, by Lauchlan D. Gordon Duff, the preface dates it much earlier:

> The author of this manuscript was William Baird, Esq. of Auchmeddan, in the parish of Aberdour, in the district of Buchan and County of Aberdeen.
> ...
> As appears from several of his incidental remarks in the course of this manuscript, he should seem to have written it during the period from the year 1763 to the year 1773, when he sent it as a present to William Duff, of Muirtown, grandson of Provost William Duff of Inverness, with the view, there can be no doubt, of having it preserved as a genealogical memorial of the family of Duff.

p50-51
Alexander Duff of Braco was born in the end of 1650 or beginning of 1651.

After his Education at School & Colledge was over, he attended a Writer to the Signet's Chamber at Edinr. some years, and came into employment himself as an Agent, but retired to the country in 1675.

He married early to Margaret Gordon, Daughter of Sir James Gordon of Lesmore, who outlived him many years ; he sat long in the Scotch Parliament as one of the Representatives of the County of Banff, and was alwise for what he thought the interest of his Country.

p52-
He was certainly a good Countryman in all national concerns, and a very useful member of Society in the North of Scotland, by the care he took to have all the Highland Robers and Thieves who pestered the low Country at that time, apprehended and brought to Justice on which Occasion he frequently exposed his own life to very great danger, but at the same time gave good proof of his courage and conduct.

One instance, which made a great deal of noise at the time, gave occasion to a Ballad which is still sung in the Country, I mean the seizing of Mcpherson and Peter Brown in Summerive's fair at Keith, Septr. 1700.

They were two notorious breakers of the Peace in all sort of villiany. Braco had made several attempts to catch them, but as they were protected by the Laird of Grant, Laird Lewis, who did not look with a very favourable eye on him, he was still disappointed.

As soon as he spied them in the market, he desired his Brother-in-law, Lesmurdy, to bring him a dozen of stout able men, which he did ; they all attackt the villains, who having several of their accomplices with them, made a desperate Resistence. One of them made a pass at Braco intending to run him thro the heart, but the durk slented alongst the outside of his Ribs without cutting the Skin, and one of Braco's men stab'd the Fellow dead. They carried Mcpherson & Brown to a house in Keith where Braco & Lesmurdy left them with a Guard, not expecting any more opposition.

But when they were in an upper room with two or three of their acquaintances concerting the committment of their Prisoners ; the Laird of Grant, with Thirty armed men, came to the door calling for them, and swearing that no Duff in Scotland should keep them from him. Braco, hearing the noise of the Grants, came down Stairs and said, with seeming unconcern and in good humour, that he intended to have sent them to Prison. But he saw they were protected by too strong a Party for him to contend with, and, therefore, must give them up ; but without losing a moment he took a turn thro' the market, found other two Justices of Peace, held a Court, and assembled sixty able bold men, who retook the Criminals. They were sent to Prison, carried to Edinr. and tried ; they were both condemned to be hanged, Mcpherson's sentence was executed, but by Grant's interest Brown's was changed into Banishment.

ANECDOTES OF J. MACPHERSON, THE ANCIENT FREEBOOTER AND MUSICIAN.

Mr. Editor,— You are, no doubt, acquainted with many traits of character peculiar to the *Gael*; and it is believed the following account of a gipsy freebooter will shew, how much the ferocity and meanness of his maternal tribe were corrected by occasionally associating with the generous mountaineers who countenanced him, for the sake of his father. James Macpherson, the subject of our memoir, was born of a beautiful gipsy, who at a great wedding attracted the notice of a half-intoxicated highland gentleman. He acknowledged the child, and had him reared in his house, until he lost his life in bravely pursuing a hostile clan, to recover a spraith of cattle taken from Badenoch. The gipsy woman, hearing of this disaster, in her rambles the following summer, came and took away her boy; but she often returned with him, to wait upon his relations and clansmen, who never failed to clothe him well, besides giving money to his mother. He grew up in strength, stature, and. beauty, seldom equalled. His sword is still preserved at Duft-house, a residence of the Earl of Fife, and few men in our day could carry, far less wield it as a weapon of war; and if it must be owned his prowess was debased by the exploits of a freebooter, it is certain no act of cruelty, no robbery of the widow, the fatherless, or distressed, and no murder, was ever perpetrated under his command. He often gave the spoils of the mch to relieve the poor; and ail his tribe were restrained from many atrocities of rapine by their awe of his mighty arm. Indeed, it is said that a dispute with an aspiring and savage man of his tribe, who wished to rob a gentleman's house while his wife and two children lay on the bier for interment, was the cause of his being betrayed to the vengeance of the law. The magistrates of Aberdeen were exasperated at Macpherson's escape, when they bribed a girl in that city to allure and deliver him into their hands. There is a platform before the jail, at the top of a stair, and a door below. When Macpherson's capture was made known to his comrades by the frantic girl, who had been so credulous as to believe the magistrates only wanted to hear the wonderful performer on the violin, his cousin, Donald Macpherson, a gentleman of Herculean powers, did not disdain to come from Badenoch, and to join a gipsy, Peter Brown, in liberating the prisoner. On a market-day they brought several assistants ; and swift horses were stationed at a convenient distance. Donald Macpherson and Peter Brown forced the jail, and while Peter Brown went to help the heavily-fettered James Macpherson in moving away, Donald Macpherson guarded the jail-door with a drawn sword. Many persons, assembled at the market, had experienced James Macpherson's humanity, or had shared his bounty; and they crowded round the jail as in mere curiosity, but, in fact, to obstruct the civil authorities from preventing a rescue. A butcher, however, was resolved, if possible, to detain Macpherson, expecting a large recompense from the magistrates: he sprang up the stairs, and leaped from the platform upon Donald Macpherson, whom he dashed to the ground by the force and weight of his body. Donald Macpherson soon recovered, to make a desperate resistance; and the combatants tore off each other's clothes. The butcher got a glimpse of his dog upon the platform, and called him to his aid; but Macpherson, with admirable presence of mind, snatched up his own plaid, which lay near, and threw it over the butcher, thus misleading the instinct of his canine adversary. The dog darted with fury upon the plaid, and terribly lacerated his master's thigh. In the mean time, James Macpherson had been carried out by Peter Brown, and was soon joined by Donald Macpherson, who was quickly covered by some friendly spectator with a hat and great coat. The magistrates ordered webs from the shops to be drawn across the Gallowgate; but Donald Macpherson cut them asunder with his sword, and James, the late prisoner, got off on horseback. He was some time after betrayed by a man of his own tribe; and was the last person executed at Banff, previous to the abolition of heritable jurisdiction. He was an admirable performer on the violin; and his talent for composition is still in evidence in "Macpherson's Rant,", " Macpherson's Pibroch," and "Macpherson's Farewell." He performed those tunes at the foot of the fatal tree; and then asked if he had any friend in the crowd to whom a last gift of his instrument would be acceptable. No man had hardihood to claim friendship with a delinquent, in whose crimes the acknowledgment might implicate an avowed acquaintance. As no friend came forward, Macpherson said, the companion of many gloomy hours should perish with him; and, breaking the violin over his knee, he threw away the fragments. Donald Macpherson picked up the neck of the violin, which to this day is preserved, as a valuable memento, by the family of Cluny, chieftain of the Macphersons. B. G.
