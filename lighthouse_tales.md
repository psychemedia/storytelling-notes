LIGHT-KEEPERS AND DEATH AT THE SMALLS. — There are now always three light-keepers on duty at off-shore lighthouses. When was this number first appointed by the authorities at the Trinity House? It is usually stated that this course was adopted in consequence of the tragic occurrence at the Eddystone, when one of the two only then employed died, and his companion, being unable to obtain help from shore for nearly a month, owing to the prevalence of stormy weather, was obliged to keep his companion's body in the lighthouse unburied rather than run the risk of being accused of having murdered him. It has, however, been recently said, but without the authority for the statement being given, that the regulation requiring the constant employment of three lightkeepers was in consequence of a death at the Smalls Lighthouse in 1802.

The dues arising from the Eddystone light were in private hands down to 1807. Will any of your readers give me an authoritative statement as to whether the maintenance of the light was previously in the hands of the proprietors or of the Trinity Board? W. S. B. H

LIGHT-KEEPERS AND DEATH AT THE SMALLS (7th S. viii. 26). — In 'Grainger's Wonderful Museum,' published in 1808, the same story of the death of one of the two attendants and the non-interment of the body is given on the authority of Mr. Smeaton, the engineer and builder of the Eddy stone, who died on September 8, 1792. From the same source I learn that the "proprietors " were induced to employ a third hand, consequently the regulation must have been issued before the Trinity Board were responsible for the maintenance of the lighthouse.

LlGHT-KEEPEKS AND DEATH AT THE SMALLS

(7th S. viii. 26, 79).— Near to the end of the third edition of Cooke's 'County of Devon' there is given an "additional account of Eddystone Lighthouse," in which it is explained that after the destruction, in 1703, of Winstanley's erection "a second was not commenced till the year 1706, after the making of an act. vesting the duties payable by shipping passing the light-house, in the Trinity-house, and empowering the master, wardens, &c., to grant leases. In consequence of these powers, they agreed with a Captain Level, or Lovet, for a term of ninety-nine years, commencing from the day that a light should be exhibited. Upon this agreement Capt. Lovet engaged a Mr. John Rudyerd (who) erected a second light-house (which) was commenced in July, 1706; and sufficiently completed to exhibit a light on July 28, 1708."

The agreement would terminate in 1807, the year which is referred to by W. S. B. H. Rudyerd's structure was burnt in 1755, and it was in this lighthouse that the tragic incident related by Smeaton had occurred. J. F. MANSERGH.

VIGIL RECALLED, By H. W. EVANS, SOLVA.

The recent seven days' vigil on the Ives Lighthouse vividly reminds one of a local event on the Smalls Lighthouse some twenty miles outside our little harbour of Solva in 1802. This first edifice was erected on eight oak pillars, 80ft. high, with a small apartment, like a crow's nest, for a living room on the top. It was aptly styled a " strange wooden-legged Malay-looking baraccoon of a lighthouse." It had been inhabited for some 25 years before this incident took place.

The two light keepers then on duty were Thomas Howells, of Kingheriot, and Thomas Griffiths, of Solve. Both were married and had families. Vessels continually reported that they had observed distress signals on the Smalls, and although repeated attempts were made tt was found impossible to land there owing to the tempestuous weather. They only succeeded in getting near enough to see the dim outline of a man standing in the gallery of the lighthouse, but could get no reply to their signals.

The anxiety on shore of Mr. Whiteside, its builder and designer, and to the relatives of the men was intense. Night after night saw them on the cliffs watching the lights, fearful of something having befallen the keepers, but as regularly as they watched, so the light burned with its usual brightness.

A day or so before the signal of distress was hoisted, Griffiths complained of being unwell, and after many weeks of intense suffering, the poor fellow breathed his last. Howell's skill as a cooper enabled him to make a coffin for him out of the boards from the bulkhead in the dwelling apartment. Atter incredible labour he placed the body in the coffin and conveyed it to the gallery above and lashed it to the railings.

The body could not be thrown to the sea, as suspicion with her thousand tongues might then point to Howells.

Finally, a Milford Haven boat landed two light keepers and brought Howell and his dead companion away. The mental and physical strain which Howell had undergone told heavily upon him so that his friends scarcely knew him. After four months in each a place and tinder such circumstances, whom would it not affect? After that experience three lighthousekeepers are always on duty at the Smalls.

The tragedy of Smalls Lighthouse
...
For a while, Thomas Howell kept the body of is colleague inside the living compartment with him but understandably after a time this began to bother him, particularly so when the body began to decompose.
Unfortunately, the two men were known to argue quite a lot and Howell's naturally worried that if he merely threw the body into the sea that he would soon be accused of a treacherous murder.
...
The bad weather did not abate and further terrible winds blasted the coffin apart, sending the timbers crashing into the sea.  There remained, though, tied to the railings, the emaciated remains of Thomas Griffith.  When the winds blew at a particular angle, it appeared that the dead man was beckoning to his colleague.
...
For four months it was impossible to land on the rocky island and all that could be seen was some sort of distress signal.  At the time, though the Royal Navy had its famous custom of communicating with flags, there was no Morse-code or equivalent for Lighthouses or anyone else for that matter.  A distress signal could be created but who could know what was being signalled.
...
It took several more months before a craft was able to land on the island and for all that time, Howell had no choice but to spend every day and night looking out at the beckoning corpse.   Not that, people didn't try to land earlier. Some of the bravest crews of the West Coast attempted landfall but the seas were also too rough.  They could see a figure standing on top of the lighthouse waving to them but he never seemed to respond to their shouts and so the sailors were forced to return to port with no more information than they had before.
...
When Howell was finally relieved from the lighthouse the effect the situation had had on him was said to be so extreme that he was driven quite mad and his physical appearance and mental wellbeing had so changed that his friends on the mainland no longer recognised him.

... The two had been witnessed on numerous occasions arguing and shouting at each other at the local pub. A more disagreeable pair could hardly have been chosen to occupy a tiny hut in such a hostile and lonely place. Yet, in 1801, that is exactly what happened.  ...
Howell was aware of the public perception of his relationship with Griffith. Rather than commit the remains to the sea, he elected to preserve them, lest he be accused of murdering his partner. Unfortunately, the storms persisted and the beacon went unanswered. Night after night as the hut swayed in the besieging waves, Thomas Griffith began to rot.  
The quiet lump and slow decay was more than Howell could stand. He felt that the corpse was watching him, silently admonishing him from beneath its feeble shroud. Eventually, he could stand it no longer and Howell began constructing a casket for the corpse out of the hut's interior walls. With an enormous effort of strength and will, he gathered Griffith into the coffin and secured him on a ledge outside the hut. Still, the beacon burned in vain.  
As the gale force winds continued to batter the lighthouse, Griffith's coffin began to break apart. Howell tried to make repairs, though he simply lacked the resources. Eventually, one of Griffiths arms broke free and began flailing with the wind, rapping against the lighthouse window. To Howell, it looked as if the hand with its rotted flesh was beckoning him to come outside. For weeks, the rapping continued. Howell imagining Griffith's voice and laughter howling in the winds. The hands seemed to have some undead life, moving and gesturing with the storms.  
... More disturbingly, there were reports of someone standing on the ledge of the lighthouse, possibly trying to signal for help. This could only have been the corpse of Griffith, lashed to the hut in his shattered coffin.

About 1800, probably in the winter of 1800-1, the lighthouse was the scene of a grim tragedy. Ivor Emlyn gives a graphic description of this harrowing experience. (1) Two lighthouse keepers, Thomas Howell and Thomas Griffith, were on duty in the lighthouse; extremely bad weather prevailed, and landing on the rock was impossible. During the height of the storm, vessels passing the rock reported when they arrived in port that signals of distress were flying on the lighthouse. No code of signals then existed, so what the matter was none could tell. All attempts by boats to land on the rock or to approach sufficiently close to make communication possible proved futile. They could only get near enough to see the dim outline of one of the men standing on the gallery of the lighthouse. Whether he spoke they could not tell.

Weeks went by and the mystery remained unsolved. With the strain Whiteside and the relatives of the keepers were almost distracted, but the fact that the light was exhibited only between sunset and sunrise was evidence that both the men were not incapacitated.

At last the weather moderated and a boat was able to get to the lighthouse. It was discovered that Griffith, after weeks of suffering, had died. The feelings of the surviving keeper can be imagined better than described. Imprisoned in a confined space with a corpse, without any hope of immediate assistance, was the predicament in which he found himself, and unless the body was soon removed the atmosphere would become vitiated. To dispose of it by casting it into the sea might throw suspicion on himself. However, Howell was formerly a cooper, and the skill he had acquired in that trade enabled him to fashion a rough coffin out of the wood taken from a bulkhead in the living apartment, after  which with a supreme effort he managed to carry the coffin »> Ivor Emlyn, pp. 18-21.

with its burden up to the gallery and to secure it to the railings, where it remained for three weeks. The storm, it has been said, lasted four months. The mental and physical anguish Howell had endured had reduced him to such a state that when brought ashore some of his friends hardly recognized him. After this terrible experience three keepers were in attendance at the same time during the winter months.

## Flannan Isles Mystery

I first came across this tale whilst specifically looking for lightoghouse tales, for a possible short set with a nautical theme.

Scene setting


Island myths...

https://web.archive.org/web/20070313003106/http://www.appins.org/martin.htm
There are several springs and fountains of curious effects; such as that at Loch-Carlvay, that never whitens linen, which hath often been tried by the inhabitants. The well at St. Cowsten's Church never boils any kind of meat, though it be kept on fire a whole day. St Andrew's Well, in the village Shader, is by the vulgar natives made a test to know if a sick person will die of the distemper he labours under. They send one with a wooden dish to bring some of the water to the patient, and if the dish, which is then laid softly upon the surface of the water, turn round sun-ways, they conclude that the patient will recover of that distemper; but if otherwise, that he will die.

...

Several other stones are to be seen here in remote places, and some of them standing on one end. Some of the ignorant vulgar say, they were men by enchantment turned into stones; and others say, they are monuments of persons of note killed in battle.

...

Near to the north-west promontory of Carlvay Bay, called Galen-head, are the little islands of Pabbay, Shirem, Vacksay, Wuya, the Great and Lesser. To the north-west of Galen-head, and within six leagues of it, lie the Flannan-Islands, which the seamen call North-hunters; they are but small islands, and six in number, and maintain about seventy sheep yearly. The inhabitants of the adjacent lands of the Lewis, having a right to these islands, visit them once every summer, and there make a great purchase of fowls, eggs, down, feathers, and quills. When they go to sea, they have their boat well manned, and make towards the islands with an east wind; but if before or at landing the wind turn westerly, they hoist up sail, and steer directly home again. If any of their crew is a novice, and not versed in the customs of the place, he must be instructed perfectly in all the punctilioes observed here before landing; and to prevent inconveniences that they think may ensue upon the transgression of the least nicety observed here, every novice is always joined with another, that can instruct him all the time of their fowling: so all the boat's crew are matched in this manner. After their landing, they fasten the boat to the sides of a rock, and then fix a wooden ladder, by laying a stone at the foot of it, to prevent its falling into the sea; and when they are got up into the island, all of them uncover their heads, and make a turn sun-ways round, thanking God for their safety. The first injunction given after landing, is not to ease nature in that place where the boat lies, for that they reckon a crime of the highest nature, and of dangerous consequence to all their crew; for they have a great regard to that very piece of rock upon which they first set their feet, after escaping the danger of the ocean.

The biggest of these islands is called Island-More; it has the ruins of a chapel dedicated to St. Flannan, from whom the island derives its name. When they are come within about 20 paces of the altar, they all strip themselves of their upper garments at once; and their upper clothes being laid upon a stone, which stands there on purpose for that use, all the crew pray three times before they begin fowling: the first day they say the first prayer, advancing towards the chapel upon their knees; the second prayer is said as they go round the chapel; the third is said hard by or at the chapel; and this is their morning-service. Their vespers are performed with the like number of prayers. Another rule is that it is absolutely unlawful to kill a fowl with a stone, for that they reckon a great barbarity, and directly contrary to ancient custom.

It is also unlawful to kill a fowl before they ascend by the ladder. It is absolutely unlawful to call the island of St. Kilda (which lies thirty leagues southward) by its proper Irish name Hirt, but only the high country. They must not so much as once name the islands in which they are following by the ordinary name Flannan, but only the country. There are several other things that must not be called by their common names, e.g., Visk, which in the language of the natives signifies Water, they call Burn; a Rock, which in their language is Creg, must here be called Cruey, i.e., hard; Shore in their language, expressed by Claddach, must here be called Vah, i.e., a Cave; Sour in their language as expressed Gort, but must be here called Gaire, i.e., Sharp; Slippery, which is expressed Bog, must be called Soft; and several other things to this purpose. They account it also unlawful to kill a fowl after evening-prayers. There is an ancient custom by which the crew is obliged not to carry home any sheep-suet, let them kill ever so many sheep in these islands. One of their principal customs is not to steal or eat anything unknown to their partner, else the transgressor (they say) will certainly vomit it up; which they reckon as a just judgment. When they have loaded their boat sufficiently with sheep, fowls, eggs, down, fish, &c., they make the best of their way homeward. It is observed of the sheep of these islands that they are exceeding fat, and have long horns.

I had this superstitious account not only from several of the natives of the Lewis, but likewise from two who had been in the Flannan islands the preceding year. I asked one of them if he prayed at home as often, and as fervently as he did when in the Flannan Islands, and he plainly confessed to me that he did not: adding further, that these remote islands were places of inherent sanctity; and that there was none ever yet landed in them but found himself more disposed to devotion there, than anywhere else. The Island of Pigmies, or, as the natives call it, the Island of Little Men, is but of small extent. There has been many small bones dug out of the ground here, resembling those of human kind more than any other. This gave ground to a tradition which the natives have of a very low-statured people living once here, called Lusbirdan, i.e., pygmies.

TELEGRAM FROM MASTER, LIGHTHOUSE TENDER,
"HESPERUS", REPORTING ACCIDENT AT FLANNAN ISLANDS LIGHTHOUSE

26 December, 1900
A dreadful accident has happened at Flannans. The three Keepers, Ducat, Marshall and the occasional have disappeared from the island. On our arrival there this afternoon no sign of life was to be seen on the Island. Fired a rocket but, as no response was made, managed to land Moore, who went up to the Station but found no Keepers there. The clocks were stopped and other signs indicated that the accident must have happened about a week ago. Poor fellows they must been blown over the cliffs or drowned trying to secure a crane or something like that. Night coming on, we could not wait to make something as to their fate. I have left Moore, MacDonald, Buoymaster and two Seamen on the island to keep the light burning until you make other arrangements. Will not return to Oban until I hear from you. I have repeated this wire to Muirhead in case you are not at home. I will remain at the telegraph office tonight until it closes, if you wish to wire me.

Master, HESPERUS

LETTER FROM MR J MOORE, ASSISTANT
LIGHTKEEPER, WHO WAS DUE FOR RELIEF DUTY AT THE LIGHTHOUSE

Flannan Islands Lighthouse
28 December 1900


Sir

It was with deep regret I wish you to learn the very sad affair that has taken place here during the past fortnight; namely the disappearance of my two fellow lightkeepers Mr Ducat and Mr Marshall, together with the Occasional Keeper, Donald McArthur from off this Island.

As you are aware, the relief was made on the 26th. That day, as on other relief days, we came to anchorage under Flannan Islands, and not seeing the Lighthouse Flag flying, we thought they did not perceive us coming. The steamer's horn was sounded several times, still no reply. At last Captain Harvie deemed it prudent to lower a boat and land a man if it was possible. I was the first to land leaving Mr McCormack and his men in the boat till I should return from the lighthouse. I went up, and on coming to the entrance gate I found it closed. I made for entrance door leading to the kitchen and store room, found it also closed and the door inside that, but the kitchen door itself was open. On entering the kitchen I looked at the fireplace and saw that the fire was not lighted for some days. I then entered the rooms in succession, found the beds empty just as they left them in the early morning. I did not take time to search further, for I only too well knew something serious had occurred. I darted out and made for the landing. When I reached there I informed Mr McCormack that the place was deserted. He with some of the men came up second time, so as to make sure, but unfortunately the first impression was only too true. Mr McCormack and myself proceeded to the lightroom where everything was in proper order. The lamp was cleaned. The fountain full. Blinds on the windows etc. We left and proceeded on board the steamer. On arrival Captain Harvie ordered me back again to the island accompanied with Mr McDonald (Buoymaster), A Campbell and A Lamont who were to do duty with me till timely aid should arrive. We went ashore and proceeded up to the lightroom and lighted the light in the proper time that night and every night since. The following day we traversed the Island from end to end but still nothing to be seen to convince us how it happened. Nothing appears touched at East landing to show that they were taken from there. Ropes are all in their respective places in the shelter, just as they were left after the relief on the 7th.

On West side it is somewhat different. We had an old box halfway up the railway for holding West landing mooring ropes and tackle, and it has gone. Some of the ropes it appears, got washed out of it, they lie strewn on the rocks near the crane. The crane itself is safe.

The iron railings along the passage connecting railway with footpath to landing and started from their foundation and broken in several places, also railing round crane, and handrail for making mooring rope fast for boat, is entirely carried away. Now there is nothing to give us an indication that it was there the poor men lost their lives, only that Mr Marshall has his seaboots on and oilskins, also Mr Ducat has his seaboots on. He had no oilskin, only an old waterproof coat, and that is away. Donald McArthur has his wearing coat left behind him which shows, as far as I know, that he went out in shirt sleeves. He never used any other coat on previous occasions, only the one I am referring to.

 

REPORT BY SUPERINTENDENT ON DISASTER
AT FLANNAN ISLANDS LIGHTHOUSE

On receipt of Captain Harvie's telegram on 26 December 1900 reporting that the three keepers on Flannan Islands, viz James Ducat, Principal, Thomas Marshall, second Assistant, and Donald McArthur, Occasional Keeper (doing duty for William Ross, first Assistant, on sick leave), had disappeared and that they must have been blown over the cliffs or drowned, I made the following arrangements with the Secretary for the temporary working of the Station.

James Ferrier, Principal Keeper was sent from Stornoway Lighthouse to Tiumpan Head Lighthouse and John Milne, Principal Keeper at Tiumpan Head was sent to take temporary charge at Flannan Islands. Donald Jack, the second Assistant Storekeeper was also despatched to Flannan Islands, the intention being that these two men, along with Joseph Moore, the third Assistant at Flannan Islands, who was ashore when the accident took place, should do duty pending permanent arrangements being made. I also proceeded to Flannan Islands where I was landed, along with Milne and Jack, early on the 29th ulto.

After satisfying myself that everything connected with the light was in good order and that the men landed would be able to maintain the light, I proceeded to ascertain, if possible, the cause of the disaster and also took statements from Captain Harvie and Mr McCormack the second mate of the HESPERUS, Joseph Moore, third Assistant keeper, Flannan Islands and Allan MacDonald, Buoymaster and the following is the result of my investigations:-

The HESPERUS arrived at Flannan Islands for the purpose of making the ordinary relief about noon Wednesday, 26 December and, as neither signals were shown, nor any of the usual preparations for landing made, Captain Harvie blew both the steam whistle and the siren to call the attention of the Keepers. As this had no effect, he fired a rocket, which also evoked no response, and a boat was lowered and sent ashore to the East landing with Joseph Moore, Assistant Keeper. When the boat reached the landing there being still no signs of the keepers, the boat was backed into the landing and with some difficulty Moore managed to jump ashore. When he went up to the Station he found the entrance gate and outside doors closed, the clock stopped, no fire lit, and, looking into the bedrooms, he found the beds empty. He became alarmed at this and ran down to the boat and informed Mr McCormack and one of the seamen managed to jump ashore and with Moore made a thorough search of the Station but could discover nothing. They then returned to the ship and informed Captain Harvie who told Moore he would have to return to the Island to keep the light going pending instructions, and called for volunteers from his crew to assist in this.

He met with a ready response and two seamen, Lamont and Campbell, were selected with Mr MacDonald, the Buoymaster, who was on board, also offered his services, which were accepted and Moore, MacDonald and these two seamen were left in charge of the light while Captain Harvie returned to Breasclete and telegraphed an account of the disaster to the Secretary.

The men left on the Island made a thorough search, in the first place, of the Station and found that the last entry on the slate had been made by Mr Ducat, the Principal Keeper on the morning of Saturday, 15 December. The lamp was crimmed, the oil fountains and canteens were filled up and the lens and machinery cleaned, which proved that the work of the 15th had been completed. The pots and pans had been cleaned and the kitchen tidied up, which showed that the man who had been acting as cook had completed his work, which goes to prove that the men disappeared on the afternoon which was received (after news of the disaster had been published) that Captain Holman had passed the Flannan Islands in the steamer ARCHTOR at midnight on the 15th ulto, and could not observe the light, he felt satisfied that he should have seen it.

On the Thursday and Friday the men made a thorough search over and round the island and I went over the ground with them on Saturday. Everything at the East landing place was in order and the ropes which had been coiled and stored there on the completion of the relief on 7 December were all in their places and the lighthouse buildings and everything at the Stations was in order. Owing to the amount of sea, I could not get down to the landing place, but I got down to the crane platform 70 feet above the sea level. The crane originally erected on this platform was washed away during last winter, and the crane put up this summer was found to be unharmed, the jib lowered and secured to the rock, and the canvas covering the wire rope on the barrel securely lashed round it, and there was no evidence that the men had been doing anything at the crane. The mooring ropes, landing ropes, derrick landing ropes and crane handles, and also a wooden box in which they were kept and which was secured in a crevice in the rocks 70 feet up the tramway from its terminus, and about 40 feet higher than the crane platform, or 110 feet in all above the sea level, had been washed away, and the ropes were strewn in the crevices of the rocks near the crane platform and entangled among the crane legs, but they were all coiled up, no single coil being found unfastened. The iron railings round the crane platform and from the terminus of the tramway to the concrete steps up from the West landing were displaced and twisted. A large block of stone, weighing upwards of 20 cwt, had been dislodged from its position higher up and carried down to and left on the concrete path leading from the terminus of the tramway to the top of the steps.

A life buoy fastened to the railings along this path, to be used in case of emergency had disappeared, and I thought at first that it had been removed for the purpose of being used but, on examining the ropes by which it was fastened, I found that they had not been touched, and as pieces of canvas was adhering to the ropes, it was evident that the force of the sea pouring through the railings had, even at this great height (110 feet above sea level) torn the life buoy off the ropes.

When the accident occurred, Ducat was wearing sea boots and a waterproof, and Marshall sea boots and oilskins, and as Moore assures me that the men only wore those articles when going down to the landings, they must have intended, when they left the Station, either to go down to the landing or the proximity of it.

GREAT LIGHTHOUSE DISASTER. KEEPERS DROWNED.
Intimation has been received at the Northern Lighthouse Board, Edinburgh, of the loss of the lighthouse staff the Flannan Lighthouse.

The station was established in December last year, and was staged by four men, three duty and the other having relief.

When the Board's steamer yesterday went to the islands to land the relieving keeper,it was found that the three men last duty had disappeared, leaving no trace behind.

They are — the principal keeper, James Ducat;  and Thomas Marshall, and Donald McArthur —the latter occasional keeper on duty in place of a sick member of the regu-

It is surmised that thev were swept away during the storm of last week, either when a crew or when trying to  render assistance to some vessel in distress. The relieving keeper and three other men have been temporarily left the Island.

UPARALLELED INCIDENT.

No such incident has ever happened in the history of the Lighthouse Board, and it is provident that it did not result in disaster to any passing vessel.

The Flannan Islands are group of seven islands seventeen miles west of Lewis, in the Hebrides.

DISASTER AT FLANNAN ISLANDS LIGHTHOUSE. THREE MEN DROWNED. A telegram was received on Thursday by Superintendent Smith, of the Stornoway police, from the west end of the Island of Lewis, conveying the sad intelligence of the loss on Friday or Saturday last of the three keepers of the Flannan Islands Lighthouse. No particulars have come to hand as to how the disaster occurred. The names of the keepers on duty then were James Ducat (43), Thos. Marshall (28). and Donald Macarthur (40). The lighthouse steamer proceeded during Thursday to the Flannan Islands. but was unable to effect a landing owing to the state of the sea surrounding the island on which the lighthouse is built. Signals were exhibited from the steamer, but no response came from the lighthouse, nor could any sign of human life be seen about the place. The tower appears to be intact, but the lantern has not been lit for the past six nights. Great anxiety prevails concerning the men, and conjecture is busy with all sorts of stories regarding their fate. The homes of the men are at Breasclete, on Loch Roag, where a pier has also been built for the relieving steamer.

MYSTERIOUS LIGHTHOUSE DISASTER OFF THE LEWIS.
THREE MEN LOST.

The Northern Lighthouse Board received intelligence in Edinburgh of a terrible disaster that had occured on the Flannan which are shout 44 miles west of the Butt of Lewis, and 40 miles north of St Kilda. The lighthouse in one of the rock stations where three men are continually stationed, fortnightly reliefs being given. The three men List stationed on the lighthouse were named James Ducat, the principal keeper; Thomas Marshall and Donald McArthurur, the last named being an occasional keeper, employed in this instance during the illness of one of the regular staff. The relieving keeper, Moore, was landed on the island by the Board's steamer, and the absence of all the men showed that a dreadful occurrence had happened. So far as is presently known, the men have vanished, and nothing definite is known of their fate. It is, however, surmised that the calamity happened during the great storm of last week. As the regulations provide that during the night one man must remain in constant attendance on the lights, it is regarded as practically certain that the accident occurred in daylight, and it is suggested as one probably cause that the men have been blown over the cliffs and drowned while trying to secure the crane. Another theory is that they may have been trying to give asssistance to a fishing boat or other vessel in distrees. The relieving keeper, Moore, was left at the lighthouse with three other men to keep the light burning pending permanent arrangements. The Flannan islands are a group of seven small  am gr alp .-mall precipitous islands, sometimes called "the seven hunters," covering an area of about three miles by two.The easternmost is about 17 miles off Gallon Head, in Lewis, and the islands lie near the track of vessels bound from the westward, and making to take the north passage through the Pentland Firth. The light, which was first lighted on 1st December of last year, is seen 24 miles off in clear weather. A system of signalling in case of need, exists between the lighthouse and the nearest point on the main islands, from whence the light is visble in clear weather. It is explained that the absence of signalling gave rise to no suspicion that anything was wrong, and that it would be taken for granted that the light could not be seen on account of the recent bad weather. Of the three men lost two were married men, Ducat and Macarthur. The former's wife and family reside at Breasclete, in Lewis, to which plac Macarthur, who was and old army man, belonged. It is understood tha no such occurrence ever before happened in the history of the Board, the most serious previous disaster being the loss of the attending boat, with all hands, on a run between Kirkcudbright and the Little Ross some years ago.

FLANNAN ISLANDS LIGHTHOUSE STAFF DISAPPEAR. ARBROATH MAN DROWNED.
 
Intimation was received on Thursday by the Northern Lighthouse Board, Edinburgh, of the loss of lighthouse staff at the Flannan Island* Lighthouse. The station was established in December of last year, and was staffed by four men, three taking duty and one having relief. When the Board's steamer on Wednesday went to the Islands to land the relieving keeper it was found that the three men last on duty— James Ducat, the principal keeper, who is native of Arbroath, and whose father lives in Lochlaud Street, and Thomas Marshall, and Donald M'Arthur, the latter an occasional keeper, who was on duty in place of a sick member of the regular staff, had disappeared. So far as is yet known no trace of them was found, and it is surmised that they were swept away during the storm of last week, either when attempting to save a crane or when trying to render assistance to some vessel in distress. The relief keeper with three other men have been left on the island, pending permanent arrangements. Mr Ducat was well-known here amongst circle of friends in his younger days. He was engaged for some time as a pupil-teacber in Chapelton School, Inverkeilor. Subsequently he entered the service of Messrs Thomas Muir, Son, & Patton, coal merchants here, as a clerk, at which occupation he was engaged for about a couple of years. He then became a clerk in the employment of Mr Lackie, ironmonger, Montrese, where he remained for some time. Fully 20 years ago he became lighthousekeeper, for which occupation had always a particular liking. After being for some time at St Abb's Head he was transferred to Girdleness, and afterwards received bis first appointment to the station in Scurdyness, Montrose. From Scurdyness, Mr Ducat was transferred to Inchkeith. His next appointment was to Loch Ryan, and then to the Isle of Man. At the opening of the Flannan Islands Station in December Mr Ducat was appointed chief keeper, and transferred his wife and family to the land station at Breasclete. Mr Ducat ia survived by a wife and four children, for whom much sympathy ia felt in their sad bereavement.

1900 crew disappearance

Flannan Isles Lighthouse
The first record[3] that something was abnormal on the Flannan Isles was on 15 December 1900 when the steamer Archtor, on a passage from Philadelphia to Leith, noted in its log that the light was not operational in poor weather conditions. When the ship docked in Leith on 18 December 1900, the sighting was passed on to the Northern Lighthouse Board.[10] The relief vessel, the lighthouse tender Hesperus, was unable to sail from Breasclete, Lewis, as planned on 20 December due to adverse weather; it did not reach the island until noon on 26 December.[8] The lighthouse was manned by three men: James Ducat, Thomas Marshall, and Donald McArthur, with a rotating fourth man spending time on shore.

On arrival, the crew and relief keeper found that the flagstaff had no flag, none of the usual provision boxes had been left on the landing stage for re-stocking, and more ominously, none of the lighthouse keepers were there to welcome them ashore. Jim Harvie, the captain of Hesperus, attempted to reach them by blowing the ship's whistle and firing a flare, but was unsuccessful.

A boat was launched and Joseph Moore, the relief keeper, was put ashore alone. He found the entrance gate to the compound and the main door both closed, the beds unmade, and the clock unwound. Returning to the landing stage with this grim news, he then went back up to the lighthouse with Hesperus's second-mate and a seaman. A further search revealed that the lamps had been cleaned and refilled. A set of oilskins was found, suggesting that one of the keepers had left the lighthouse without them. There was no sign of any of the keepers, neither inside the lighthouse nor anywhere on the island.[8][11]

Moore and three volunteer seamen were left on the island to attend the light and Hesperus returned to Lewis. Captain Harvie sent a telegram to the Northern Lighthouse Board dated 26 December 1900, stating:

A dreadful accident has happened at the Flannans. The three keepers, Ducat, Marshall and the Occasional have disappeared from the Island... The clocks were stopped and other signs indicated that the accident must have happened about a week ago. Poor fellows they must have been blown over the cliffs or drowned trying to secure a crane.[8][11]

On Eilean Mòr, the men scoured every corner of the island for clues as to the fate of the keepers. They found that everything was intact at the east landing but the west landing provided considerable evidence of damage caused by recent storms. A box at 33 metres (108 ft) above sea level had been broken and its contents strewn about; iron railings were bent over, the iron railway by the path was wrenched out of its concrete, and a rock weighing more than a ton had been displaced. On top of the cliff at more than 60 metres (200 ft) above sea level, turf had been ripped away as far as 10 metres (33 ft) from the cliff edge.[12]

Northern Lighthouse Board investigation
On 29 December 1900, Robert Muirhead, a Northern Lighthouse Board (NLB) superintendent, arrived to conduct the official investigation into the incident. Muirhead had originally recruited all three of the missing men and knew them personally.[13][14]

He examined the clothing left behind in the lighthouse and concluded that Ducat and Marshall had gone down to the western landing stage, and that McArthur (the 'Occasional') had left the lighthouse during heavy rain in his shirt sleeves. He noted that whoever left the light last and unattended was in breach of NLB rules.[8] He also noted that some of the damage to the west landing was "difficult to believe unless actually seen".[15]

From evidence which I was able to procure I was satisfied that the men had been on duty up till dinner time on Saturday the 15th of December, that they had gone down to secure a box in which the mooring ropes, landing ropes etc. were kept, and which was secured in a crevice in the rock about 110 feet [34 meters] above sea level, and that an extra large sea had rushed up the face of the rock, had gone above them, and coming down with immense force, had swept them completely away.[16]

Whether this explanation brought any comfort to the families of the lost keepers (Ducat left a wife and four children; McArthur, a wife and two children) is unknown.[15] This development did, however, tarnish the lighthouse's reputation for many years after the incident. [17]

Speculation and conjecture
No bodies were ever found, but there have been some mysterious sights resulting in "fascinated national speculation" in newspapers and periodicals of the era.[18] Implausible stories ensued, such as that a sea serpent had carried the men away; that they had arranged for a ship to take them away and start new lives; that they had been abducted by foreign spies; or that they had met their fate through the malevolent presence of a boat filled with ghosts (the baleful influence of the "Phantom of the Seven Hunters" was widely suspected locally).[8] More than ten years later, the events were still being commemorated and elaborated on. The 1912 ballad Flannan Isle by Wilfrid Wilson Gibson refers erroneously to an overturned chair and uneaten meal laid out on the table, indicating that the keepers had been suddenly disturbed.[15]

Yet, as we crowded through the door,
We only saw a table spread
For dinner, meat, and cheese and bread;
But, all untouch'd; and no-one there,
As though, when they sat down to eat,
Ere they could even taste,
Alarm had come, and they in haste
Had risen and left the bread and meat,
For at the table head a chair
Lay tumbled on the floor.[19]

However, in a first-hand account made by Moore, the relief keeper, he stated that: "The kitchen utensils were all very clean, which is a sign that it must be after dinner some time they left."[8]

Later theories and interpretations
Over time, a story has developed of the existence of unusual log book entries. They supposedly have Marshall saying on 12 December that there were "severe winds the likes of which I have never seen before in twenty years". He also is said to have reported that Ducat had been "very quiet" and Donald McArthur had been crying. McArthur was a veteran mariner with a reputation for brawling, and thus it would be strange for him to be crying in response to a storm. Log entries on 13 December were said to have stated that the storm was still raging, and that all three men had been praying. This was also puzzling, as all three men were experienced lighthouse keepers who knew they were in a secure structure 150 feet above sea level and should have known they were safe inside. Furthermore, there had been no reported storms in the area on the 12, 13 and 14 December.[20] The final log entry is said to have been made on 15 December, stating "Storm ended, sea calm. God is over all".[13] An investigation by Mike Dash for the Fortean Times revealed that the logbooks were fictional, later additions to the story.[21]

The westernmost of the Flannan Isles: Eilean a' Ghobha and Roareim with Brona Cleit in the distance
Subsequent researchers have taken into account the geography of the islands.[8] The coastline of Eilean Mòr is deeply indented with narrow gullies called geos. The west landing, which is situated in such a geo, terminates in a cave. In high seas or storms, water would rush into the cave and then explode out again with considerable force. It was possible McArthur may have seen a series of large waves approaching the island and, knowing the likely danger to his colleagues, ran down to warn them only to be washed away as well in the violent swell.[22] Recent research by James Love discovered that Marshall was previously fined five shillings when his equipment was washed away during a huge gale. It is likely, in seeking to avoid another fine, that he and Ducat tried to secure their equipment during a storm and were swept away as a result. The fate of McArthur, although required to stay behind to man the lighthouse, can be guessed to be the same. Love speculates that McArthur probably tried to warn or help his colleagues and was swept away too.[23] This theory also has the advantages of explaining the set of oilskins remaining indoors and McArthur's coat remaining on its peg,[8][24] although perhaps not the closed door and gate.[25] Another theory is based on the first-hand experiences of Walter Aldebert, a keeper on the Flannans from 1953 to 1957. He believed one man may have been washed into the sea but then his companions, who were trying to rescue him, were washed away by more rogue waves.[25]

A further proposal is based on the psychology of the keepers. Allegedly, McArthur was a volatile character; this may have led to a fight breaking out near the cliff edge by the West Landing that caused all three men to fall to their deaths.[26] Another theory is that one of the men went insane, murdered the other two, threw their bodies into the sea, and then jumped in to his own death.[20]

SOME NOTES ABOUT THE FLANNAN ISLANDS.

The Flannan, or " Flannel Isles," as they are called in the Statistical Account of Scotland (the scene of the late disaster to the lighthouse men), are rather interesting rocky islets, and are supposed to have been the residence of eocleeiastics in the time of the Druids. They are called by Buchanan Insular Sacrae. There is at least one ruin on Eilean Mohr of some small ecclesiastical building known as "The Blessing Chapel," just below the spot on which the lighthouse is now erected. The islands, which are attached to the parish of Uig, are, as has already been stated, a rocky cluster, seven in number, with narrow waterways between them. The total area they cover would be about two miles by a quarter of a mile, the long way being east and west. The largest of the group, Eilean Mohr, ie barely a mile across. The cliffs are of gneiss. Nearly all the members of the group have this in common that their sides are precipitous. Formerly, a few sheep, belonging to people on the mainland, were grazed on the oslands, but that has been given up for many years. Macculloch speaks of the islands being a great resort for sea-birds, but people who lately visited them say that in that respect there is nothing very remarkable about them. In connection with what has been said as to the association of the Druids with this lovely group rocky islands, it may be recalled that, at Callornish, near the head of Loch Roag, are the celebrated Druidical standing stones, forming one of the most complete remains of the kind in the kingdom, while at the neighbouring township of Carloway is one of the largest and most perfect Danish forts or dounes to be met with in Scotland. It was in the sands of the bay of Uig, in 1831, that a number of small ivory sculptured figures, resembling chessmen, were found, and being of great antiquity, were transmitted to the Antiquarian Society of Edinburgh. In Martin Martin's volume, "A Description of the Western Islands of Scotland," dated 1695, a chapter is devoted to "interior Islands," adjacent to Lewis. Dealing with the subject, the writer says:—

"Near to the north-west promontory of Carloway Bay, called Gallenhead, are the little islands of Pabbay, Shirem, Vaxay, Wayn, the Great and Lesser. To the north-west of Gallenhead, and within six leagues of it, the Flannan islands, which the seamen call North Hunters; they are but small islands, and six in number, and maintain about seventy sheep yearly. The inhabitantes of the adjacent lands of the Lewis, having a right to these islands, visit them every summer, and there make a great purchase of fowls, eggs, down, feathers, and quills. When they go to sea they have their boat well manned, and make towards the islands with an east wind; but if before or at the landing the wind turn westerly, they hoist up sail end steer directly home again. If any of their crew is a novice, and not versed in the customs of the piece, he must he instructed perfectly in all the punctilioes observed here before landing, and to prevent inconveniences that they think may ensue upon the transgression of the least nicety observed here, every novice is always joined with another that can instruct him all the time of their fowling; so all the boat's crew are matched in this manner. After their landing, they fasten the boat to the sides of the rock, and then fix a wooden ladder by laying a stone at the foot of it to prevent its falling into the sea, and they are got up into the island, all of them uncover their heads, and make a turn sun-ways round, thanking God for their safety. The biggest of these islands is called Island More; it has the ruins of a chapel, dedicated to St Flannan, from whom the island derives its name. When they are come within about twenty paces of the altar they all strip themselves of their upper garments at once, and their upper clothes being laid upon a stone, which stands there on purpose for that use, all the crew pray three times before they begin fowling; the first day they say the first prayer, advancing towards the chapel upon their knees; the second prayer is said as they go round the chapel: the third is said hard by or at the chapel; and this is their morning service. Their vespers are performed with the like number of prayers. Another rule is that it is absolutely unlawful to kill a fowl with a stone, for that they reckon a great barbarity, and directly contrary to ancient custom. It is also unlawful to kill a fowl before they ascend by the ladder. It is absolutely unlawful to call the island of St Kilda (which lies thirty leagues, southwards) by its proper Irish name, Hirt, but only the high country. They must not so much as once name the islands in which they are fowling by the ordinary name, Flannan, but on the country. There are several other things that must not he called by their common names, e.g.. visk, which in the language of the natives signifies water, they call burn; a rock, which in their language is crag, must here he called cruey, i.e., hard; ahem, in their language expressed by claddach, must here be called vah, i.e., a cave; sour in their language is expressed gort, but must here be called gair, i.e., sharp; slippery, which is expressed bog, must he called soft; and several other things to this purpose. They count it also unlawful to kill a fowl after evening prayers. There is an ancient custom by which the crew is obliged not to carry home sheep suet, let them kill ever so many sheep in these islands."

THE FLANNAN DISASTER.

IT is not surprising to find an almost world-wide interest being taken in the mystery which surrounds the disappearance of the three keepers of the Flannan Islands Lighthouse. No other event of this distressing character has happened in the history of the Scottish Lighthouse Board, who have under their charge 102 lighthouses and stations, extending from St Abb's Head, Berwickshire, round the coast to Kircudbright, and south to the Chickens Rock at the Isle of Man. The editor of that enterprising illustrated journal, the *Sphere*, has courteously forwarded to this office a proof copy of an illustrated notice of the now sadly-historic Eileen Mhor, which is to appear in Saturday's issue. As an extended account of the islands appeared in our own paper last week, it is only necessary here to mention that the *Sphere's* pictures are seven in number, and that they enable one to form an excellent idea of the seven lonely lumps of gneiss rock, which in ancient times, by the way, were inhabited by people like the St Kildans, who raised sheep and ponies, and collected eggs, down, feathers, and quills.

The Disappearance of the Keepers of the Flannan Islands Lighthouse in the Outer Hebrides.

A serious disaster was reported on Thursday, December 27, to the Scottish Lighthouse Board. When the Board's relieving staff went to Flannan Islands Light house, near the island of Lewis, on Wednesday, the 26th, they found that the staff of three men were missing, and it is supposed that they were all drowned during the great gale of the preceding week. Their names are James Ducat, principal keeper, Thomas Marshall, and Donald McArthur, the latter an occasional keeper, who was relieving a sick man on the regular staff.

No such accident as this has ever before happened in the history of the Scottish Lighthouse Board, the commissioners of which have under their charge 102 lighthouses and stations extending from St. Abb's Head, Berwick shire, to Kirkcudbright and south to Chickens Rock on the Isle of Man. The lighthouse where this unfortunate disaster has just occurred was a newly-constructed one, the light being first lit on December 1, 1899. The lighthouse is perched on the summit of Eilean Mohr, the western most of the Flannan Islands or "Seven Hunters" as they are sometimes called, the islands being seven in number. It is a full seventeen miles west of the nearest point of the island of Lewis, Outer Hebrides, the chief town of which is Stornoway. The island resembles the Bass Rock in shape, but is somewhat larger.

These seven lonely lumps of gneiss rock face the full force of the north Atlantic gales. So exposed is the position that it took four seasons to build the lighthouse, all the contractors' materials and horses having to be raised by cranes as shown in the illustration. Two landing places were constructed in order to facilitate the landing of the relief keeper and stores from whatever quarter the wind might be blowing. A little tramway runs from the steps to the lighthouse buildings. The islands are quite uninhabited but for the keepers. The lighthouse staff consisted of four men, three of whom remained on the island, the fourth man in rotation having a fortnight on shore at the comfortable house erected for them and their families at Breasclete on the north shore of Loch Roag. The light can be seen from the loch at night in fair weather, and it was usual for the men to signal the mainland at frequent intervals.

For one or two nights previous to Wednesday, December 26, the light was not seen, and the fact was telegraphed to the commissioners at Edinburgh. On Wednesday the Board's steamer set out for the island with the relieving keeper with what anxiety its return was awaited can be imagined. On arriving at the Eilean Mohr no sign of life was to be seen. A boat's crew landed and ran up the steep approach to the lighthouse. They shouted but there was no answer. The tower and the keeper's houses were searched, but not a trace of the three un fortunate keepers was to be found. A rocket was fired, but there was no response except from the sea birds. All the clocks had run down, and the last entry in the log was dated the previous Saturday. The fact that all the ropes in the storehouse have been removed and that the crane near the lighthouse has been broken away points to the fact that the men probably lost their lives in an attempt to secure the crane during the gale and were blown or washed from their foothold. A temporary staff has been landed, and the light, a 140,000 candle-power one which can be seen in clear weather for twenty-four miles, is once more warning the vessels passing to and from the Pentland Frith.

Though there are, of course, at this high latitude no great ocean liners to warn, the danger to trading steamers running between America and the east coast of Scotland owing to the Flannan light not being lit was no less great.

Captain Jenkins of the trading steamer *Manhanset* which has just arrived at Dundee from New York, reports that he passed within seven miles of the Flannan Islands on Sunday, December 23. The weather was clear at the time, but he saw no light, though a sharp look out was kept. The last entry in the log it will be noticed was on Saturday, the day previous.

Though until recently quite uninhabited it is evident that the islands were dwelt upon at some remote period from the remains of two ancient buildings still standing just below the lighthouse, supposed to have been the residence of Druid priests or hermits. Old records speak of the islands as *insula sacra*. The proximity of the Druidical "standing stones" of Callernish certainly lends probability to an occupation of the islands in recent prehistoric times. From an old work entitled *A Description of the Western Islands of Scotland*, written by Martin Martin, and dated 1695, it would at first appear as if the islands were inhabited, for he mentions that the inhabitants of Lewis made an annual excursion to the six islands (there are really seven) and there made " a great purchase of fowls, eggs, down, feathers and quills." It is, however, clear from the rest of the narrative that the Lewis islanders merely landed on an uninhabited island where the birds and wild sheep bred undisturbed during the rest of the year, and gathered supplies of all these articles mentioned, there being none to say them nay. The Lewis men said prayers at the ancient chapel, but it is evident that no priest officiated there:—

> When they are come within about twenty paces of the altar they all strip themselves of their upper garments at once, and their upper clothes being laid upon a stone, which stands there on purpose for that use, all the crew pray three times before they begin fowling; the first day they say the first prayer, advancing towards the chapel upom their knees; the second prayer is said as they go round the chapel; the third is said hard by or at the chapel and this is their morning service. Their vespers are performed with the like number of prayers. Another rule is that it is absolutely unlawful to kill a fowl with a stone, for that they reckon a great barbarity and directly contrary to ancient custom. ... The biggest of these islands is called Island More it has the ruins of a chapel dedicated to St. Flannan, from whom the island derives its name. The Island ot Pigmies— or, as the natives call it, the Island of Little Men— is but of small extent. There have been many small bones dug out of the ground here, resembling those of human kind more than any other. This gave ground to a tradition which the natives have of a very low-statured people once living here called Lusbirdan i.e., pigmies.

One of the accounts of the disaster states that here is no land between the Flannan Islands and America. Due west there is nothing but ocean, but slightly to the south-west there is the lonely rock known as Rockall, presumably from the fact that it is all rock. This lies at a distance of 184 miles west of St. Kilda. It is 70 ft. high by 100 ft. round. Its position enders it unique as there is no other rock situated at such a distance from land. P. H.

THREE MEN VANISHED.
MYSTERY OF THE LIGHTHOUSE.

Neil Macpherson, of Stafford Street, Oban, Argyll, has retired after serving 39 years as head steward of the West of Scotland lighthouse steamer Hesperus.

A few months after joining the service he sailed in the Hesperus on a relief trip to the Flannan Isle lighthouse, the loneliest in Britain, standing on the top of a perpendicular cliff.

No trace of the three keepers could be found on the island. The table in the lighthouse had been set for three, but the meal was untouched.

The mystery of the Flannan lighthouse has never been solved.

LITTLE HOPE FOR MISSING MEN

Search Made for Flannan Isle Lighthouse Keepers

There is still news of the two lighthouse keepers reported missing from the Monach Isles Light since Sunday.

The latest information is that the Barra lifeboat has made thorough search in the Neighbourhood, and, finding no trace of the men or their boat, has returned to Castle bay.

The lighthouse ship Pole Star has arrived at the Monach Light. It is believed that the Pole Star has also searched the vicinity, but it is not known whether any trace the missing men has been found.

Called from Cape Wrath

The missing keepers are Mr James Milne, head keeper, and Mr W. M. Black, a supernumerary. Mr Milne has been for many years in the service. He is a widower, and his twenty-year-old daughter, Annie, keeps house for him. She is at present on the Monach Isles. Mr Black has been only three months the service.

He is a native of Stromness and unmarried. A brother of his is cook on the Pole Star, which was summoned from Suleskerry, off Cape Wrath.

Mr Archibald Macmillan, the assistant keeper, has been the only man on the island of Shillay, where the Monach lighthouse stands, since Sunday morning, when his two companions set off their boat to post their letters at the neighbouring island of Heisker. Mrs Macmilian and Miss Milne have been the only women on the island.

InHelpless Position

Mr Macmillan was in a helpless position when his two companions failed to return.

He had no boat, as they had taken the only one on the island. He had no proper communication with Heisker. He communicated with the Flannan lighthouse and through the Flannans an SOS was sent which brought the lifeboat and the Pole Star hurrying to the scene.

On Monday morning saw an upturned boat on the rocks across the Sound from Shillay but he had no means of going see whether it was the lighthouse boat.

Yesterday morning he reported that the boat had disappeared.

Little Hope

"There can little hope for them," Mr J. G. Wakelin, secretary of the Commissioners of Northern Lighthouses, stated in Edinburgh last night.

During the day, he added, the steamer had landed two relief keepers on the island on which the lighthouse stands to take the place of the missing men.

LIGHTHOUSE MEN VANISH SEARCH NEAR SCOTS ISLE

HELP RUSHED TO LONE KEEPER

The Barra lifeboat was searching last night for two of the three keepers at the lonely Monach Lighthouse, west of North Uist, the Outer Hebrides, who are missing and believed drowned.

A capsized boat has been seen. Meantime help is on the way to the remaining keeper, who is working the light by himself.

The news reached the mainland by means of the short-wave telephone system which is fitted in every West of Scotland lighthouse, and by means of which the attendants of one lighthouse can communicate with their neighbours.

The wife of one of the Butt of lighthousemen stated in an interview tha they had been in half-hourly communication with the Monach Isles via the lighthouse of Flannan since the men were reported missing.

SQUALLS AND RAIN.

Mr Milne, the head keeper, and Mr Black, tha supernumerary at the Monach Isles, left on Sunday by small boat to go to the neighbouring island of Heisker for mails.

They were last seen about 4.40 p.m. It is thought that they were then on their way back. It was squally, and there was a bad shower.

Since the men disappeared their upturned boat has been seen on the rocks. That was yesterday morning, and it has since disappeared.

The Barra lifeboat had a 50-mile run to the area where the two men disappeared It was intended to search through the night with the aid of the searchlight.

When the news was communicated the Northern Lighthouse Commissioners' office in Edinburgh the commissioners got into touch with the lighthouse steamer Pole Star at Stromness, and the ship left immediately with one of the assistant keepers from the Butt of Lewis to relieve Mr MacMillan, the Monach assistant keeper, who is keeping solitary vigil

FROM ANGUS COAST.

Milne has been in the lighthouse service about 20 years, and comes from the Angus coast.

Black, a single man, from the Orkneys, has been in the service only a short time.

ANOTHER S.O..S. FROM LIGHTHOUSE

The lighthouse steamer Hesperus left Oban last night in response to another urgent radio message, which stated that one of the three keepers on the Flannan Lighthouse, which is the most westerly lighthouse in Scotland, had met with an accident.

The lighthouse is about 100 miles west of the Butt of Lewis.

No details of the accident are available.

The Hesperus left Oban nine o'clock. She would take about 18 hours to reaoh the lighthouse.

Flannan Isles Lighthouse DisasterReport by Superintendent on Disaster at Flannan Islands Lighthouse Undated (c.January 1901, Northern Lighthouse Board archives). On receipt of Captain Harvie's telegram on 26 December 1900 reporting that thethree keepers on Flannan Islands, viz James Ducat, Principal, Thomas Marshall,second Assistant, and Donald McArthur, Occasional Keeper (doing duty for WilliamRoss, first Assistant, on sick leave), had disappeared and that they must have beenblown over the cliffs or drowned, I made the following arrangements with thesecretary for the temporary working of the Station.James Ferrier, Principal Keeper, was sent from Stornoway Lighthouse toTiumpan Head Lighthouse and John Milne, Principal Keeper at Tiumpan Head wassent to take temporary charge at Flannan Islands. Donald Jack, the second AssistantStorekeeper, was also dispatched to Flannan Islands, the intention being that thesetwo men, along with Joseph Moore, the third Assistant at Flannan Islands, who wasashore when the incident took place, should do duty pending permanent arrangementsbeing made. I also proceeded to Flannan Islands where I was landed, along withMilne and Jack, early on the 29th ulto. After satisfying myself that everything connected with the lighthouse was ingood order and that the men landed would be able to maintain the light, I proceededto ascertain, if possible, the cause of the disaster and also took statements fromCaptain Harvie and Mr McCormack, the second mate of the Hesperus, Joseph Moore, third Assistant Keeper, Flannan Islands and Allan Macdonald, Buoymaster, and thefollowing is the result of my investigations:—The Hesperus arrived at Flannan Islands for the purpose of making ordinaryrelief about noon on Wednesday, 26 December and, as neither signals were shown,nor any of the usual preparations for landing made, Captain Harvie blew both thesteam whistle and the siren to call the attention of the Keepers. As this had no effect,he fired a rocket, which also evoked no response, and a boat was lowered and sentashore to the East landing. There being still no signs of the Keepers, the boat wasbacked into the landing and with some difficulty Moore managed to jump ashore.When he went up to the Station he found the entrance gate and outside doors closed,the clock stopped, no fire lit, and, looking into the bedrooms, he found the bedsempty. He became alarmed at this and ran down to the boat and informed MrMcCormack, the second mate, that he Keepers were missing. McCormack and one of the seamen managed to jump ashore and with Moore made a thorough search of theStation but could discover nothing. They then returned to the ship and informedCaptain Harvie who told Moore he would have to return to the Island to keep the lightgoing pending instructions, and called for volunteers from the crew to assist in this.He met with a ready response and two seamen, Lamont and Campbell, were selectedand Mr Macdonald, the Buoymaster, who was on board, also offered his services,which were accepted, and Moore, Macdonald and these two seamen were left incharge of the light while Captain Harvie returned to Breasclete and telegraphed anaccount of the disaster to the secretary.The men left on the Island made a thorough search, in he first place, of theStation and found that the last entry on the slate had been made by Mr Ducat, thePrincipal Keeper on the morning of Saturday, 15 December `[This specifically contradicts the notion that it was Marshall who kept up the log, as is stated in mostsecondary sources. As Principal, log–keeping would certainly have been Ducat's duty.]`. This is borne out byinformation which was received (after news of the disaster had been published) that Captain Holman had passed the Flannan Islands in the steamer Archtor at midnight of the 15th ulto., and could not observe the light, although from the conditions of theweather and his position, he felt satisfied that he should have seen it.On the Thursday and Friday `[27 and 28 December]` the men made a thorough search over andround the island and I went over the ground with them on the Saturday. Everything atthe East landing place was in order and the ropes which had been coiled and storedthere on completion of the relief on 7 December were all in their places and thelighthouse buildings and everything in the Station was in order. Owing to the amountof sea, I could not get down to the landing place, but I got down to the crane platformabout 70 feet above the sea level. The crane originally erected on this platform waswashed away during last winter, and the crane put up this summer was found to beunharmed, the jib lowered and secured to the rock, and the canvas covering the wirerope on the barrel securely lashed round it, and there was no evidence that the menhad been doing anything at the crane. The mooring ropes, landing ropes, derrick landing ropes and crane handles, and also a wooden box in which they were kept andwhich was secured in a crevice in the rocks 70 feet up the tramway from the terminusof the tramway to the concrete steps up from the West landing, were displaced andtwisted. A large block of stone, weighing upwards of 20 cwt., had been dislodgedfrom its position higher up and carried down to and left on the concrete path leadingfrom the terminus of the tramway to the top of the steps. A life buoy fastened to therailing along this path, to be used in case of emergency, had disappeared, and I thought at first that it had been removed for the purpose of being used but, on examining the ropes by which it had been fastened, I found that they had not been touched, and pieces of canvas were adhering to the ropes, [and] it was evident that the force of the sea pouring through the railings had, even at this great height (110 feet above sea level), torn the life buoy off the ropes. When the accident occurred, Ducat was wearing sea boots and a waterproof, and Marshall sea boots and oilskins, and Moore assures me that the men only wore those articles when going down to the landing of the proximity of it.After a careful examination of the place, the railings, ropes etc and weighing all the evidence which I could secure, I am of the opinion that the most likely explanation of the disappearance of the men is that they had all gone down on the afternoon of Saturday, 15 December to the proximity of the West landing, to secure the box with the mooring ropes, etc and that an unexpectedly large roller had come upon the Island, and a large body of water going up higher than where they were and coming down upon them had swept them away with resistless force. I have considered and discussed the possibility of the men being blown by the wind, but, as the wind was westerly, I am of the opinion, notwithstanding its greatforce, that the more probable explanation is that they have been washed away as, had the wind caught them, it would, from its direction, have blown them up the Island and I feel certain that they would have managed to throw themselves down before they had reached the summit or brow of the Island.On conclusion of my enquiry on Saturday afternoon, I returned to Breasclete, wired the result of my investigations to the Secretary and called on the widows of James Ducat, the Principal Keeper and Donald McArthur, the Occasional keeper. I may state that, as Moore was naturally very much upset by the unfortunate occurrence, and appeared very nervous, I left A. Lamont, seaman, on the Island to go to the lightroom and keep Moore company when on watch for a week or two. If this nervousness does not leave Moore, he will require to be transferred, butI am reluctant to recommend this, as I would desire to have at least one man who knows the work of the Station. The Commissioners appointed Roderick MacKenzie, Gamekeeper, Uig, near Meavaig, to look out daily for signals that might be shown from the Rock, and to note each night whether the light was seen or not seen. As it was evident that light had not been lit from the 15th to the 25th of December, I resolved to see him on Sunday morning, to ascertain what he had to say on the subject. [His son is] an intelligent lad of the gamekeeper class, who actually performs the duty of looking out for signals —and I had a conversation with him on the matter, and I also examined the Return Book. From the December Return, I saw that the tower itself was not seen, even with the assistance of a powerful telescope, between the 7th and the 29th December. The light was, however, seen on 7 December, but was not seen on the 8th, 9th, 10th and 11th. It was seen on the 12th, but was not seen again until the 26th, the night on whichit was lit by Moore. MacKenzie stated (and I have since verified this), that the lights sometimes cannot be seen for four or five consecutive nights, but he was beginning to be anxious at not seeing it for such a long period, and had, two nights prior to its reappearance, been getting the assistance of the natives to see if it could be discerned. Had the lookout been kept by an ordinary Lightkeeper, as at Earraid for Dubh Artach, I believe it would have struck the man ashore at an earlier period that something was amiss, and, while this would not have prevented the lamentable occurrence taking place, it would have enabled steps to be taken to have the light re–lit at an earlier date. I would recommend that the Signalman should be instructed that, in future, should he fail to observe the light when, in his opinion, looking to the state of the atmosphere, it should be seen, he should be instructed to intimate this to the Secretary, when the propriety of taking steps could be considered. I may explain that signals are shown from Flannan Islands by displaying balls or discs from each side of the Tower, on poles projecting out from the Lighthouse balcony, the signals being differentiated by one or more discs being shown on the different sides of the Tower. When at Flannan Islands so lately as 7th December last, I had a conversation with the late Mr Ducat regarding the signals, and he stated that hewished it would be necessary to hoist one of the signals, just to ascertain how soon itwould be seen ashore and how soon it would be acted upon. At that time I took a noteto consider the propriety of having a daily signal that all was well — signals underthe present system only being exhibited when assistance of some kind is required. After carefully discussing the matter, and discussing it with the officials competent to offer an opinion on the subject, I arrived at the conclusion that it would not be advisable to have such a signal, as, owing to the distance between the Island and theshore, and to the frequency of haze on top of the Island, it would often be unseen between the 7th and 29th December, and an 'All Well' signal would have been of nouse on this occasion.The question has been raised as to how we would have been situated had wireless telegraphy been instituted, but, had we failed to establish communications for some days, I would have concluded that something had gone wrong with the signaling apparatus, and the last thing that would have occurred to me would have been that all the three men had disappeared. In conclusion, I would desire to record my deep regret at such a disaster occurring to Keepers in this Service. I knew Ducat and Marshall intimately, andMcArthur the Occasional, well. They were selected, on my recommendation, for thelighting of such an important Station as Flannan Islands, and as it is always myendeavour to secure the best men possible for the establishment of a Station, as the success and contentment of a Station depends largely on the Keepers present at its installation, this of itself is an indication that the Board has lost two of its mostefficient Keepers and a competent Occasional. I was with the Keepers for more than a month during the summer of 1899,when everyone worked hard to secure the early lighting of the Station before winter,and, working along with them, I appreciated the manner in which they performed their work. I visited Flannan Islands when the relief was made so lately as 7th December, and have the melancholy recollection that I was the last person to shake hands with them and bid the adieu.

THE ROUND TOWERS OF IRELAND
AND
THE FRENCH "FANAUX DE CIMETIERE."
By nODDER M. WESTRORP.
Mr. Fergusson, in his Handbook of Architecture, remarks that Dr. Petrie's argument with regard to the Round Towers only removes the difficulty one step further back, as he does not attempt to show- whence the Irish obtained this very remarkable form of tower; and adds, that any one who has seen the towers must feel that there is still room for any amount of speculation regarding such peculiar monuments. In reading Do Caumont's Cours d' Antiquites Monumentales, I have been struck with a very remarkable analogy between the Irish Round Tower and what is named in De Caumont's work, a "Fanal de Cimctiere," a beacon of a cemetery, or lantern of the dead; which lias led me to add another speculation to the already long list, and to infer that tho Irish Round Towers derive their origin from France, and that they were erected in cemeteries as memorials of the dead, and were used as beacons to guide funeral processions to the churchyards, the lights in the tower serving also as a signal to recall to the passers-by the presence of the departed spirit, and to invoke their prayers. The following is De Caumont's description of them: "Fanaux de Cimetiere are hollow towers, round or square, having at their summit several openings, in which were placed in the middle ages, [12th and 13th centuries] lighted lamps, in the centre of large cemeteries. The purpose of the lamp was to light, during the night, funeral processions which came from afar, and which could not always reach the burial-ground before the close of day. The beacon, lighted, if not always, at least on certain occasions, at the summit of the towers, was a sort of homage offered to the memory of the dead, a signal recalling to the passers-by the presence of the departed, and calling upon them for their prayers. And M. Villegille has found in Pierre de Cluni, who died in 115G, a passage which confirms my opinion. These are the words in which he expresses himself with regard to the small tower of the beacon at the monastery of Cherlieu: 'Obtinet medium cemeterii locum structura quadam lapidea, habens in summitate sui quantitatem unius lampadis capacem, qua), ob venerentiam fidelium ibi quiescentium, totis noetibus fulgore suo locum ilium sacratum illustrat.' M. Le Cointre Dupont remarks that these towers or beacons are found particularly in cemeteries which were by the side of high roads, or which were situated in much frequented plaees. The motive for erecting these beacons was, he says, to save the living from the fear of ghosts and spirits of darkness, with which the imagination of our ancestors peopled the cemeteries during the night time; to protect them from that timore nocturno, from that yiegotio per- ambulante in tenelris of which the Psalmist speaks; lastly, to incite the living to pray for the dead. As to the origin of these sepulchral towers, and of the chapels surmounted by towers (which I shall mention further on) nothing certain is known. Le Cointre thinks that they are of very ancient origin, and can be traced perhaps to the early period of Christianity. Without disputing this opinion, which would require to be confirmed by authorities which I am not in a position to produce, I think that it was about the 1 2th century, consequently about the time of the Crusades, that the greater num- ber of these erections were built; for among those which remain, I know of none to which an earlier date can be assigned than that of the end of the 11th century, and many are of the 13th. If we are to judge by those which remain, few sepulchral chapels surmounted by towers were built after the 13th century. Some of these, which were rebuilt in the 14th and 15th centuries, took the form of a high tower: such is the tower of Puyberland, at Bordeaux, not far from the Cathedral. This very high tower was commenced in 1481, and finished in 1492; but it has succeeded or was built upon a sepulchral chapel, for it is known that in 1397, the base on which it was built was used as a sepulchral vault, and that over this vault was a chapel, in which canons celebrated mass. The belfry of St. ]\Iichel, in the same town, which has a sepulchral vault at its base, and which is of the loth century (1480), has been perhaps also built over some similar vault; it is detached from the church, and is in the midst of a plot of ground which formed the ancient cemetery." De Caumont thus describes one of the towers at Antigny, near St. Savin, in the department of Vienne: " It is iu the middle of a square before the parish church, which evidently formed part of the ancient cemetery, for it is almost completely paved with tomb-stones. Four square windows, turned towards the east, west, north, and south, open under its roof, at the summit of the tower; it was there the light was placed; the door was at some distance from the ground." He then mentions others: "The Fanal of Fenioux is in the cemetery of that village, at a hundred paces distance from the church, opposite to the south door. The Fanal of Estrees occupies nearly the centre of a large plot of ground, to the south of which is the ancient road from Buzancais to Polluan, and to the north of which are the remains of the parish church of Estrees, a building of the 11th century, the choir of which is still remaining. This plot of ground was formerly the burial-ground of the parish. The tower is built on an octagonal basement; the height is 8 metres 30 centimetres. The Fanal of Ciron is 150 metres from the church of the village, and, like that of Estrees, in the centre of a large cemetery. The Fanal of Terigny l'Eveque was also in a cemetery, about 300 paces distant from the church, near which passed the ancient road which, according to M. Demazy, was the old way which led from Mans to the Roman Camp at Songe. It is terminated by a conical roof; its four windows are turned towards the four cardinal points. Its height is 14 metres 70 centimetres." He adds: "I could also mention several other towers, pointed out by different authors, which ought to be assigned to the class of building which I have indicated."

The preceding description, it must be allowed, bears a very striking resemblance to everything that is characteristic of the Irish Hound Towers, and would, I think, lead to the conviction that there must be some connecting link between these and the "Fanaux," and that their purpose must have been almost identical. They were both used for sepulchral purposes; they were erected as memorials of the dead in cemeteries; they were placed in church-yards unsymme- trically at some little distance from the churches; they were built in much frequented places (such as, in Ireland, (Tonmacnoise, Glendalough, &c); their four windows at the summit face the four car- dinal points; the doors, too, are at some distance from the ground, evidently for the purpose of raising a ladder through the door into the tower. The towers are also of the same period, the 11th and 12th centuries, and never later than the 13th; finally, there is a tradition 174
in Ireland that they were used as beacons. I cannot but think that there is, in both classes of towers, a similarity of principle as well as of form; for we find that in the dark ages the same superstitious customs were practised in different countries. The early Christians, particularly those who were converted from Paganism, frequently adopted and introduced (as has been the case in Italy) Pagan customs and practices into the Christian religion; and it would be but natural to suppose that the custom of lighting a lamp in a tower in honour of the dead (a Pagan custom) was introduced into Ireland from France; for, as Dr. Petrie argues with regard to the use of lime cement in religious edifices, a knowledge of this custom may have been imparted by the crowds of foreign ecclesiastics who flocked to Ireland as a place of refuge in the 5ih and 6th centuries. We know tbat St. Patrick was a Frenchman by birth, and was educated in France; a great number of St. Patrick's disciples were also foreigners. St. Declan (who, it is said, built the tower at Ardmorc) travelled in Italy; St. Columbanus also travelled in France. Virgilius in the 8th century was born in Ireland, and like most of his countrymen at that period who were distinguished for learning, left his own country and passed into France. St. Malachy consecrated several cemeteries, and re-built many structures, "post ejus reditum e locis transmarinis." In fine, there was in the early periods a constant intercommunication between Ireland and France, particularly with regard to religious dogmas and practices. That the towers were erected in Irish cemeteries, too, as memorials of the dead, we have a kind of evidence from an apocryphal document of the 14th century. In the registry of Clonmacnoise, translated for Sir James Ware, we find it stated that "O'llourke hath for a monument built a small castle or steeple, commonly called in Irish Claigthough, as a memorial of his oxen part of that cemetarieP Its being called here a "steeple" is, of course, in conformity with the common opinion. A tower as a belfry would be very little to the purpose there; but a tower as a monument and memorial in honour of the dead would be in its proper place in a cemetery. It is, therefore, not surprising to find two round towers and several sepulchral chapels in that single cemetery, for Clonmacnoise was celebrated as being the burial-place of several Irish chiefs. Dr. Petrie also admits "that we shall find it difficult to resist the conclusion that the towers would be used at night as beacons to attract and guide the benighted traveller or pious pilgrim to the house of prayer or hospitality, llteir fitness for such a purpose must he at once obvious.'''' lie then quotes the opinion of Dr. Lingard to the same effect, that they were used as " beacons to direct the traveller towards the church or monastery. Lights were kept burning in them during the night, at least such was the fact with respect to the new tower at Winchester, which, we learn from Wolstan, consisted of live stories, in each of which were four windows looking towards the four cardinal points, that were illuminated every night." Dr. Hibbert AVare also considers this the only rational theory on the subject. Dr. Petrie adduces a further evidence in the description of the 2)haros or beacon- toAver of the Irish monastery of St. Columbanus in Luxovium, now Luxeuil in Burgundy, mentioned in Mabillon's Iter German icum: "Cernitur prope majorem Ecclesirc portam Pharos, quam Lucernam vocant, cujus omnium consimilcm vidi aliquando apud Carnutas. Ei usui fuisse vidctur, in gratiam corum qui nocte ecclesiam frcquentabantur." Mr. Fergusson, when mentioning, in his Handbook of Architecture, the round towers which are described in the plan of the monastery of St. Gall, in Switzerland, remarks the similarity of their position and form to that of the Irish round towers, which, he suggests, was in compliment to the Irish saint to whom the monastery owed its origin. He adds, " no mention is made of hells." I can never accede to the theory that the towers were built for belfries: in the first place, on account of their unsymmetrical position with regard to the churches they are near; secondly, because at Brechin in Scotland there is a round tower near the church, and also a belfry in its usual position close to the church-door; at Swords (Co. of Dublin) also, there is a round tower, as well as a belfry, in the same church-yard; and at Lusk (in the same county) there is a round tower with a steeple close to it. If the round tower was built for a belfry, what would be the use of building a belfry close to the tower at a later period? I must say that I cannot but agree with Dr. O'Conor in thinking that the cloictheachs or belfries, mentioned in the Irish Annals quoted by Dr. Petrie, could not be the present round towers, which are built of stone. The cloie- theaclis, from there being so frequently burned, must have been of wood, like the oratories. Dr. Petrie admits that the custom of building oratories of wood was continued in Ireland even down to the twelfth century; "but," he adds, "the strongest evidences in favour of the conclusion that the duirtheachs were usually of wood, are those supplied by the Irish Annals, which so frequently record the burning of this class of buildings by the Northmen, while the daimldiags (stone buildings) escaped the flames." If we apply similar reasoning to the frequent burning of cloictlisach, we must be led to the conclusion that the}" also must have been of wood.
Sepulchral on Mortuary Chapels. Do Caumont describes these in the following words: " Sometimes the Fanaux have been replaced by sepulchral chapels, surmounted by a hollow tower and a beacon. Sepulchral chapels were evidently for the same purpose as the tower?, for they too had beacons at their summit; they might also have been used for the purpose of exposing the bodies of the deceased before burial, for celebrating mass, and for other purposes the memory of which has passed away. I know but one in a state of preservation, that of the ancient cemetery of the nuns of Fonterault. It is square. Prom the summit of the stone roof of the building arises a hollow tower of 4 or o metres high, bearing a lantern at its summit; each face of the lantern is pierced with an opening, a conical roof cover > the whole, and in the interior the chapel is vaulted. The date is 1223." St. Kevin's kitchen (at Glcndalough) would seem to answer this description; and thus, if the analogy which I have suggested between the two be correct, St. Kevin's kitchen would be a stone roofed sepulchral chapel, surmounted by a tower, which, was used as a beacon, like the "fana! de eimctiere," or beacon of a cemetery. It would not, I think, be an improbable conjecture that the several churches built at Clonraacnoisc by Irish kings and petty princes were sepulchral chapels.'
Crosses of Cemeteeies. In Dc Caumont's work I remark a further analogy to Irish anti- quities in his description of "Crosses of Cemeteries," which, I think, is an additional proof that there was sonic connecting link between France and Ireland with regard to both these structures. His words are: " Crosses of Cemeteries, or crosses erected in the centre of church-yards, are also object? deserving of study, when they are ancient; for I am persuaded that during the middle ages, they have, in many burial-grounds, taken the place of the towers of which I have spoken: at the present da}-, they have taken their place in numerous sites. The most ancient that I know of are of the 12th or about the end of the 11th century. They are most frequently simple crosses inclosed in a circle, and raised on a square or cylindrical pedestal. In Brittany, crosses have been erected on which arc sculptured rather complicated groups of figures, and of a workmanship the more remarkable as they are worked in granite." Crosses like those first mentioned are found in several ancient church-yards in Ireland The cross over the door of the round tower at Antrim bears a resemblance to those ancient French crosses. Crosses like those in Brittany arc likewise to be met with at Honasterboice, Clonraacnoisc, and other places in this country.

AV'e cannot but be led to the conclusion, that there must have been some connection between France and Ireland as regards these towers, oratories, and crosses; for how otherwise are we to account for the singular coincidence that in ancient Irish burial-grounds we frequently find a group composed of a round tower, an oratory, and a cross, and that in ancient French cemeteries we find an analogous and corresponding group, composed of a "fanal" or beacon tower, a sepulchral chapel, and a cross. Some, indeed, may suppose that, on the contrary, the idea of these towers may have been received from Ireland by France; but I think this suggestion could not be admissible, as it is more in uniformity with the course of events that the tide of knowledge should flow from the east towards Ireland than that the stream should run backwards. It is a singular coincidence that Dr. Petrie designed, for the tomb of O'Connell, in the Glasnevin cemetery, a round tower, an oratory, and a cross: a round tower as a belfry would have been very little to the purpose, but I think that this group, considered as a tower or beacon of the dead, a sepulchral chapel, and a cross cf a cemetery, would have been in its proper place.

THE FLANNAN ISLES, OR " SEVEN HUNTERS."
A LANDING was successfully effected on the largest of these islands, the weather having proved favourable; a heavy swell comes in from the Atlantic, and, to ensure a safe landing, it is necessary that the weather should have been fine for a considerable time previous. Eilean Mor is the largest of this group, and south-east of it lies Eilean Tighe, the next in extent; Soraidh lies to the extreme south; and two miles to the west, there is the is- land rock called Ro- dhoreim; in addition to these there are about a score of rocky islets at various dis- ^ tances around, which prevent the steamer getting close to the landing-place.
Eilean Mor is half a mile in length, and about a quarter of a mile iu breadth at its widest part. It rises abruptly from the sea, and attains a height of nearly 300 feet, where it is comparatively level, and affords some grazing for sheep. On this island is a primitive oratory dedicated to Elannan, an Irish saint,^ the following description of which is taken from Martin's "Western Islands of Scotland," a.d. 1703: —
" The biggest of these islands is called Island More ; it has the ruins of a Chappel ^ The Flannan Isles derive their name from an Irish bishop, St. Flannan, son of dedicated to St. Flannan, from Avhom the island derives its name ; when they come within about twenty paces of the Altar, they all strip themselves of their upper garments at once, and their upper clotlies being laid upon a stone, which stands there on purpose for that use, all the crew pray three times before they begin Fowling ; the first day they say the first Prayer advancing towards the Chappel upon their knees ; the second prayer is said as they go round the Chappel; the third is said hardly or at the Chappel and this is their Morning Service.

Theodoric (Torlough), King of Thomond, and a lineal ancestor of King Brian. Flannan seems to have been born near Killaloe, and sent to St. Blathmet for his earlier education. Having distinguished himself by his piety and obedience, he returned and entered the monastery founded by St. Molua at Killaloe, from which that place derives its name. Being elected bishop by advice of Molua, he seems to have visited Rome, and been confirmed in his office by the Pope, John (? John IV., 640, or John VII., 700). We eventually learn that "the same Flannan, zealous in holy labours, disseminated the words of the Holy Gospel in the maritime islands of Scotland." His fiiend Molua is described as " reverenced among the greatest prelates of Ireland, or saints of Scotland, and more especially in the Orkneys. "_ So Flannan evidently followed the footsteps of his venerable preceptor. (See Bishop Reeves's " Adamnan," p. 227.)

The Bank-side consists of certain houses so called, from their lying on the south bank of the Thames to the westward of the Bridge.
Here, I was informed, was anciently the bordello, or stews, for the whole town, which consisted of eighteen houses known by their several signs, as the Gun, the Crane, the Cardinal's-hat, Sec. privileged and confirmed by several royal patents. And in a parliament holden the 8th of Henry II, we found the following rules prescribed them.
[Rules for bordellos]

1. That no stewholder or his wife should let or stay any single woman to go and come freely at all times when she listed. 2. No stewholder to keep any woman to board, but she to board abroad at her pleasure. 3. To take no more for the woman's chamber weekly than fourteen pence. 4. Not to keep open doors on holy-days. 5. Not to keep any single woman in the house on holy-days. 6. No single woman to be kept against her will who would leave her sin. 7. No stewholder to receive any woman of religion, or any man's wife. 8. No single woman to take money to lie with any man, unless she lie with him all night till the morrow. 9. No man to be drawn or enticed into a stew-house. 10. The constables and officers to search the stew- houses every week. 11. No stewholder to kee& any woman that hath the perilous infirmity of burning;* nor to sell ale, bread, or other provisions.
But notwithstanding these houses were privileged and protected by authority, the English appear even then to have had such an aversion to the becoming bawds and panders to other people's lusts, that the mistresses of them were generally Dutch women, who rented these tenements of the lord-mayor. And in the 37th year of Henry VIII, they were entirely suppressed.
