# Gibbeting in England

One of the joys of *N & Q* is that having started tracking down one particular topic, you can often quickly sidetrack yourself down another.

For example, we might start to wonder about when the practice of gibbeting died out in England. Such a piece of information might perhaps add colour to the tale of the hand of glory. It might also provide additional historical context for the tale I tell of Micah Morey [[related Isle of Wight storynote](https://psychemedia.github.io/island-storynotes/michael_morey_and_james_dove.html)], a man gibbeted on the Isle of Wight having been hanged for the cruel murder and dismemberment of his grandson, James Dove, in 1736.

The last Gibbet in England. — As "N. & Q." will be a work of reference hereafter, may not the following notice, which appeared in a recent number of *The Examiner*, claim a remembrance ?

The last Gibbet in England (2nd S. i. 351.) — It is stated that "the last gibbet erected in England was demolished by the workmen employed in making the extensive docks for the North-Eastern Railway Company, upon Jarrow Stoke, on the Tyne." This statement is not quite correct. At the corner of Ditchling Common, in Sussex, near to the turnpike-road which leads from Ditchling to Lindfield, there still remains a piece of an old gibbet, and a very unpleasant looking log of wood it is, known by the name of "Jacob's Post;" that being the name of the man, a Jew, who committed a very barbarous murder near to the spot, and was hanged in chains there in 1734.

The Jew, Jacob, having put up his horse at the public-house close by, attacked his host, a person named Miles, whilst he was engaged in cleaning his horse, and cut his throat. In the same way he destroyed the servant-maid, who, it is supposed, had been disturbed by the noise in the stable, and was descending the staircase to see what was the matter. He then went upstairs and cut the throat of poor Miles's wife, who was lying on a sick bed.

Some very rude verses, still preserved in the neighbourhood, of which I send you a few specimens, record the circumstances of this frightful massacre:

"In the mean time, the poor distressed maid  
Had got away, for so the neighbours said,  
He, missing her, into the stable ran,  
And looked about, but could not find her then,  
He thought that there was no time to delay,  
But took his horse with speed and rode away.  
The women both that night this world forsook,  
But Miles did live until the wretch was took.

At Horsham Gallows he was hanged there,  
The 3ist of August that same year.  
And where he did the crime, they took the pains  
To bring him back, and hang him up in chains.  
It is a dismal sight for to behold,  
Enough to make a heart of stone run cold."

GIBBETING ALIVE A writer in the *Daily News* of October 2nd says that near to Merrington Church, Durham,

"At the cross roads near the mill, there long hung the bones of the last man ever gibbeted alive. It was in 1805 that this miserable wretch was hoisted aloft to die lingeringly, and the county people to this day tell how his sweetheart kept him alive for a fortnight by raising to him on the end of a stick a sponge soaked in milk, and how, when this was detected and prevented, his yells were heard for miles."

Is there any foundation horrible a story, and was "gibbeting alive," i.e. starving to death, ever a punishment known to English law?

Yet the tale goes that he was gibbeted alive — that a girl who loved him contrived to keep him in existence for several days, and that his dying shrieks could be heard for miles around.

[ No. XIV. STRANGE GIBBET STORIES. HANGING ALIVE IN CHAINS. The question of hanging alive in chains is a disputed point in the history of England. After a careful investigation of both sides of the subject, we have come to the conclusion that it was never the law of the land to suspend a man in chains and allow him to die from hunger and exposure but in rare cases such cruel deaths have occurred in this county. l:lolinahed3 who died about 1580, in his famous " Chronicle of land," a work that supplied Shakespeare with materials for his historical dramas, states:—"ln wilful murder done upon %nMndod (premeditated) malice, or in anie notable robbery, the criminal is either hanged alive in chains near the place where the fact was committed, or else, upon compassion taken, first stnngle(i with a rope, and so continueth till his bones came to not.hlnF. ‘Where wilful manslaughter is perpetrated, besides hn:F-ing, the offender hath his right hand commonly T T T ———— seat till he got nearly home, when he fell and died soon after from exhaustion. A bO{ concealed himself near the place where Whitfield shot, was the means of bringing this unmerciful wretch to be identified ; a button off his coat being part of the evidence adduced. It is said that he hung for several days, till his cries were heartrending, and a mail-coachman, who was passing that way, put him out of his misery by shooting him." It is stated rl'n the " History of Jamaica," b Bryan Edwards, that in the negro rebellion of 1705 that two Coromantyn msm'oes‘l who had been concerned in the massacre, were hung alive in irons, and were soo left to perish.

Derbyshire Times - Saturday 11 July 1896
DERBYSHIRE GIBBET POLES. INTERESTING DESCRIPTION BY MR E. WRENCH, F.R.C.S. On Saturday some 30 members of newly formed Field Club at left that town in brakes for Beeley, where they spent a most interesting and instructive afternoon the moors. The club vas only formed at the commencement this year, raid now has membership of 60. They have fortnightly outings, and it is pleasing to find the club has made such headway. But to return to Saturday's "field day." On arriving at Beeley Tap, the party was joined E. M. Wrench, F.R.C.S., of Baslow, who then took charge of it. They visited the house at Hill Top where the Arms the Stewarts are to found. It was pointed out that Nicholas, youngest son Lord of Harroden, sold iv. Doomsday) 1650, to the family of Greaves tho from the time of Henry 111., about the middle cf the 17th century. The Greaves' sold it to Saviles, who resided Hill Top. was afterwards in 12 shares the family of Norman Brown and Wright. In 1747 William, third Duke of Devonshire, purchased the whole. The arms of the Greaves are over the fireplace at Hill Top. After other hi formation had been given the party went across East Moor to Hob Hund's house, which Mr Wrench explained, for no special reason, was called Druid's Barrow, being distinguished from the ordinary inverted bowl-shaped barrow being surrounded by a ditch and bank. It might that this may have been made years after the barrow was finished for defensive purposes. The presence of burnt human bones surrounding the skeleton in 55 per cent, the barrows opened is suspicious of human if not cannibalism, and the frequent presence of a female skeleton by the side of a male suggests suttee, as does that of an infant of infanticide. The present Esquimau? are supposed to be representative ancient Britons, and since, according to Nansen, the Esquimaux are brave, ingenious, persevering, and have strong family affections we have no need to be ashamed of our ancestors. Other interesting information having been imparted the company further move was made the pit on the East Moor, where there exposed fireclay, granite, and thia bed ooal in situ. From here the party walked to the scene of the Baslow gibbet post, where Mr Wrench pave the following interesting particulars:—l was told ono who remembered the gibbet post that old woman was frying baoon for breakfast when a tramp hepped for some of the hot fat. She said she had none spare for such as he. He attacked her and said she should have all the fat, killed her pouring the boiline ht down throat. The orir.ie was considered so serious that the tramp was sentenced gibbet ted alive. was done and waa nearly exhausted when a from Tideswell, with pack ponies laden with bread, handed him a loaf, and so prolonged his life and his fties, which were piercing that they could heard The Earl, indeed, was shocked them that he got an Act Parliament passed forbidding gibbetting alive, and hence this was the lost case of gibbetting alive in England. The neighbours were so incensed with the baker that he had to flee the country.— (N.B. —The corpses of three murderers were beheaded Derby in 1817.) The vanity of the sbstttd idea of, our forefathers in thinking that repulsive object of fids kind would act a deterrent crime wa-s strikingly shown the case the Wardlow gibbet. It related Hannah Pecking, of Litton, who was hung on March 22nd, 1819, at the early age of for poisoning Jane Grant, a young woman cf the same village that ".-die gave the poison in a sweet her companion as they ware going to fetch some cattle out a field near to which stood the post of Anthony Lingard. ' I can remember when boy seeing several gibbets mutinous sailors and pirates standing the banks of the Thames, near Woolwich. The site of another gibbet pointed out tbe orossinsr the ar.d Sheffield and the and Chesterfield roads near old pack-horse bridge over the Bar brook on the Great Moor. It is curious also remark that kill visited Grj«U probably the site of a gibbet, the Gaelic for gibbet being "Crotch." The last case of gibbetting in Derbyshire was in 1815 when Anthony Lingard, aged 21, was gibbetted Wardlow Mires. In the sheriff's accounts it is stated that the cost of apprehending Lingard £35 sd, while cost £10 10s to convey his dead body from Derby to Wardlow-, and 4s ??d to erect the gibbet and to elevate ln'm thereon. The next mention of this gibbet is in Rhodes' "Peak Scenery."

Sheffield Daily Telegraph - Thursday 24 May 1877

THE HALIFAX GIBBET LAW.

The Gibbet Law forms a curious feature in the history Halifax, and it is a subject of more than local interest. The law existed from time immemorial, and its origin is probably coeval with that of the town. It has been traced to the early period of 1280; it existed at the time when the manor of Wakefield, containing the parish of Halifax, was granted to the Earl of Warren, and was continued, down to 1650. We find in Holinshed's "Chronicle," edition 1587, the following interesting account:— There is and hath been of ancient time a law, or rather custom, at Halifax, that whosoever doth commit any felony, and is taken with the same, or confess the fact upon examination, if it be valued by four constables to amount to the sum of thirteen pence halfpenny, is forthwith beheaded upon one of the next market days (which fall usually upon the Tuesdays. Thursdays, and Saturdays), else upon tho same day that convicted, if market be bhlden. The engine wherewith tbe execution is done is square block of wood, the length of four feet and a half, which doth ride np and down in a slot, label, or regall, between two pieces timber that are framed and set upright of five yards in height. In the nether end of the sliding block is an axe, keyed or fastened with an iron into the wood, which being drawn up tbo top of the frame, is there fastened by a wooden pin (with a notch made into tho same, after tbe manner of Samson's post), unto the midst which pin also there is long rope fastened, that cometh down among the people; so that when tbe offender hath made his confession, and hath laid his neck over tbe nethermost block, every man there present doth either take bold of the rope for putting forth his arm near to the same he can get, in token that he is willing to see justice executed, and palling out tbe pin in this manner, tbe head block wherein the axe is fastened doth fall down with such violence that if the neck of the transgressor were so big as that a ball it should be cut in snador stroke and roll from the body huge distance. If it be so that the offender be apprehended for an ox, sheep, jkine, horse, or any such cattle, the self beast, or other of same kind, shall have tbe end of the rope tied somewhere unto them, so that they being drawn, draw out tbe pin -whereby the offender is executed." Before felon was condemned t< suffer, tbe proof of certain facts appears to have been essentially necessary. the first place, the felon was be taken tbe liberty; and if he escaped out of tlm liberty, even after condemnation, he could not be brought back to be executed ; but he ever returned into it again, and was taken, was sure to suffer; was the case with one Lacy, who, after his escape, lived seven years ontof the liberty, but, returning, was beheaded las former verdict, a.d. 1628. This man was not so wise one Dinnis, who, having been condemned die, escaped out of tbo liberty on tho day fixed for his execution (which might done running about five hundred yards), and neve again. Meeting several people, that naked him if Dinms was not be beheaded that day? his answer was •• trow not," I which, having tome humour in it, became a proverbial saying amongst the inhabitants, who this day use the expression, ‘I trow not," I quoth Diunis." . . . In 1(540 there was dis- I covered the pedestal, stone scaffold, which had j been concealed under a loug accumulation of • rubbish and soil forming a grassy mound com| rnouly supposed to a natural hill, ou which the temporary scaffold foi,- the gibbetwas frSm time time erected; but the town trustees having pur| chased the Gibbet Hill, and being wishful to j reduce it to the level of the surroundiug fields, I this curious relic autiquity was brought to light, and is carefully preserved. lu the enclosure the following inscription is placed;— "The Remains the Halifax gibbet within this enclosure were discovered in the year movud earth known Gibbot Hill and were euclo*Hrd the Trvstees of the Town. The Rvblic Records Preserve the Names fifty-three Persons Beheaded this spot between the years 1541 and 1050. The first on tho l.isl is Richard Bautk-y of Sowerby Execvted March 20th 1041 and the lass were John Wilkin, sou and Anthony Mitchell both Beheaded April 80, 1650. This Fence was erected at the cost and in the Mayoralty of the Worshipfvi Samvel Wateihovse. a.d. 1852." ... At the Rolls Office. Wakefield, may still seen the ancient gibbet-axe. It weighs seven pounds twelve ounces; its length is ten inches and a half;' it is seven inches broad at the top. and very near nine at the bottom; its centre is about seven inches and half. The Earl of Morton, passiug through Halifax abont the middle of the sixteenth century, witnessed execution, and gave instructions for model to made the gibbet, and on his return to Scotland, of which he was Regent, he had similar- instrument constructed, which, remaining long unused, was called "The Maiden;" bnt tbe 3rd of June, 1581, was himself executed it. •• Tho Maiden preserved in the Museum the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, Edinburgh.

RELIC OF FORMER TIMES.—THE HALIFAX GIBBET. — Our readers will recollect that the mound of earth usually called Gibbet-hill, and standing on the spot where executions, under the Halifax gibbet-law, used to take place, was enclosed, a short time ago, by the town trustees, for the purpose of being formed ir to a yard for their carts, &c. The earth, which was merely the accumulated rubbish of a series of years, probably a century or more, is now in course of removal ; and the workmen have, within the last few days, uncovered a large stone platform, let t feet square, and nearly live feet high, which is, there can be no reasonable doubt, the platform of the ancient gibbet. Part of the upper course of the store-work is wanting, but the platform appears in a better state ef preservation than could have been expected. We hope that the town trustees will take steps for the preservation of this curious relic of local antiquity, that it may remain a monument of the sanguinary laws of a rude and barbarous age.*—Halifax Express*

Yorkshire Gazette - Saturday 22 June 1839

DISCOVERY OF THE REMAINS OF THE HALIFAX GIBBET.

The workmen employed in removing rubbish from the Gibbet-Hill have this week succeeded in uncovering the remains of the ancient gibbet. Whon the usage of the gibbet had ceased, the ground on which it stood appears to have served as a receptacle for the refuse the town for the space of at least a hundred years, and the heap of rubbish thus formed became so large as to acquire the name of Gibbet-Hill. The very existence of the platform of the gibbet was nearly forgotten, and the received opinion was that it bad stood upon the hill, when in reality it stood under it, on a level with the present road. Some time since this ground was purchased from Mr. Bates by the trustees of the town, with the intension of entirely removing the hill, and keeping the place for tbe town's use. The first operations were made upon it about year since, when the workmen were instructed to the precise spot where the gibbet stood, in order that no portion of might be taken away with tbe rubbish. After considerable portion of the hill had been removed operations ceased for time. It was not till lately that they were re-commenced, when on Wednesday last the east end of tho stone platform of the gibbet was uncovered, and on the next day nearly the whole erection was exposed to view. This unique and interesting remain the stone fabric on which the upright wooden frame was placed which held the axe, and is on the south side about five feet high, and twelve feet and half square. Its form and arrangement will be readily remembered by all who have seen the old prints of the gibbet as it formerly stood the best of these may be found old Bvo. History of Halifax, published by Jacobs. It is print engraved in the year 1630, the same year which tbe last execution took place at Halifax. In this print the platform is ascended by steps, and if allow foot for each step have at once its present height; there can be no doubt but that five feet was the entire height. The first person whom we find beheaded here is thus entered in the registers—" Richard Bentley de Sowerby decollat die Martii, 1541." Since the keeping of registers in Halifax, forty.nine suffered death by decapitation this gibbet; the last two were John Wilkinson and Anthony Mitchel of Sowerby; who were beheaded April 30, 1650. A few years since, in digging the foundation for Mr. Bates's warehouse, the two skeletons of these men were found a little above where the gibbet stands; the heads were placed in both instances about half yard apart from their bodies. The remains of the platform appear very old, and the stones are much worn exposure to the weather; but the exact age of this structure cannot now be ascertained, though it may be conjectured to have been of great antiquity even in the earlier part of the sixteenth century, from tbe fact that the custom in Halifax was then according to ancient usage, which usage was agreeable to privilege enjoyed by the Earls Warren of executing all felons found within the forest Hard wick. To the townspeople of Halifax this relic of more turbulent times will possess many attractions, and will no doubt be justly valued by them. Halifax is the only town in Great Britain rendered famous by such custom; and since its gibbet is the only one now in existence ; this, together with its local association, and the fact that it is the only antique in the town worthy of notice (the parish church excepted), will no doubt ensure its preservation from further decay. Great praise is due to the workmen for the care they have exercised in removing the rubbish from these remains.— Halifax Guardian.

Southowram Bazaar

...

The *chef-d'oeuvre* of the bazaar was a model of the Halifax Gibbet, the workmanship of Mr. Graves, who had kindly presented it to the committee, The gibbet was carefully railed off, and extra silver was expected to view it. The platform was ascended by five steps, and the *modus operandi* was exhibited by a gentleman in attendance, who superseded for the afternoon the services of the executioner then upon duty. A small figure was stretched beneath the fatal beam, attended by the Sheriffs (the twelve "good men and true" were not introduced), and suffered decapitation some scores of times. Another poor wretch was "bound hand and foot," receiving absolution at the hands of the priest prior to ascending the platform. All the figures were in appropriate costume, and as far as effect could be given, the countenances of the officials wore a becoming aspect. The poor culprit who was just about to ascend the steps "grinned horribly." Considerable revenue was yielded to the funds from this source.
