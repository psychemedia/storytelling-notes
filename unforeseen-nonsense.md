Golden Casket

King wants son to marry; girl will marry who she speaks to, else they are killed; an otherwise reluctant-to-wed Prince says he will try marry her; heads off to the foreign land; in a coffee shop, hawker turns up:  "This casket for sale ! whoever buys it will rue it ; and again, whoever does not buy it, will rue it : the price is a thousand ducats, no more and no less." All eyes turn on Prince (maybe ge across idea that he is being threatened into buying it.)

Gets to town where Princess lives; Princess father also tired of his daughter; she will die if he fails. Wager is he must make her speak three times

Casket speaks to him: "As soon as you enter, say, ' Good evening to you,' and see that you put me down somewhere, and afterwards begin to tell as many lies and stories as you can. She, meanwhile, will be sitting aloft by the glass cupboard, she sees you, and you don't see her, and she is as silent as a rock. Then you must say, ' Well, as the Princess doesn't deign to speak to us, won't you speak to us ? ' naming the object on which you have placed me. Then I will begin to talk to you, and you must ask me to tell you a tale, and I shall answer, ' I will, but on your honour, wall you pronounce a right judgment thereon ? ' and you must take good care and pronounce one that is altogether wrong. Then she will be indignant, and will speak."

But since the Lady Princess will not speak with us — will not you, per chance, little shelf, speak a word with us, who are here all alone, and have no one to talk to ? "

"Gladly, master," answers the shelf; "if I would not speak for your sake, do you think I would for the sake of yonder wretch ? "

" Thanks, little shelf ! "

" What will you have ? — a song, a jest, or a little tale ? " "Well, to pass the time, let's say — a tale." " But allow me to say, master, that I shall ask you to deliver a fair judgment thereon ? "

Tale... need a get out to prompt speaking.

Smashes shelf.

Day 2, chair. Smashes chair - "you have never spoken before"

Day 3, dressing table.

## The Golden Casket — Full Story

For reference, here is the complete version of frame tale, along with the tales that were originally nested inside it. In this version, the speaking casket drops out of the nested stories in a far more powerful way, by directing a question at the Prince, which in turn is a provocation for the Princess to talk.

in E. M. Geldart, [*Folk-lore of modern Greece: the tales of the people*](https://archive.org/details/folkloremoderng00geldgoog/page/n110/mode/2up), 1884,  p106-125.

__THE GOLDEN CASKET.__

(ASTYPALEA.) 

Once on a time there was a King and a Queen who had an only son. His father said to him, " My child, you see that we have no other son ; all that I have depends on you. Therefore I desire to see you married, with children growing up to console me before I die, that I may have some joy in my old age, for you are my only hope."

The Prince was by no means willing to be married in spite of all his father could say to him ; it simply went in at one ear and out at the other.

About a week later, he said the same thing all over again. He asked him whether he had peradventure, changed his mind ; whether he had chosen any one ; and promised to give him whomsoever he should take a fancy to.

But you might as well have talked to a stone and expected an answer. His mind was not so easily swayed from its purpose. What was the King to do?

He seeks the intercession of kinswomen ; they talk to him again and again ; but without avail. However, it was bruited abroad that in a certain place there dwelt a damsel passing fair ; and there was a wager that whomsoever she speaks to, him she shall wed ; but otherwise, whoever is the suitor, they are to slay him.

Well, the fancy seized the Prince that he would essay the wager to win the maiden in question.

Accordingly, one day, when his father was repeating his entreaties, he answered, " Well, Father, as you will have me married, give me that fair maid ? "

" Goodness gracious, my son, bethink you ! " cried the King. "Would that it were in my power! But have not you heard what wagers she lays, and how many fine young fellows she has slain ? Do you want her to take your life as well ? Why there are princesses and vizier's daughters plentiful as running waters, and not one of them can be found to suit you ! But so it is ! It's a wise saying, ' Joy to the man, whose name is destined to good luck ! ' "

" That's all fudge that you are talking, you only want to damp my ardour ! I tell you, father, I am not going to marry anyone else. I am off in search of her, and if I get her— good ! If not, I will perish for her sake ! "

" Alas, my son, how you torture my heart with your impious words ! Have you no pity on me, have you no pity on your mother, who had such pains, poor thing, ere she bare you ; at your age, big lad as you are ! Is that the return we had to look for at your hands, that you should poison and embitter our old age ? Alas, what shall we say to you, when you won't listen to your elders, but rush upon your ruin ! I only pray, my son, that my evil forebodings may not find fulfilment ! "

" Nonsense, nonsense ! father. There's no turning me from my purpose."

Then, indeed, the King's eyes were dim with tears, as he wept before him like a little child, and entreated him to have regard to his own welfare : but the other, on his part, was as obstinate as obstinate could be, so his father replied :

" Well, my son, I have said all I could say as your father, and one who pities you, for I would not have a hair of your head come to harm, but you are determined to have your own way. May God have mercy upon you. I offered you a thousand sheep, and you won't so much as take a tail ! "

Then he arose and departed, his eyes running rivers of tears.

He went to the Queen, -and said to her :

" What shall I tell you, mother dear ?

" 'Our cruel fate, with ruthless hand, has written the decree,  
That winter storms and summer suns alike unkind shall be.'

One son alone was born to us, the light of our eyes, whom everyone was gladdened to behold, and now, even he has got beyond our control, and is going to fling his life away."

" What's the matter ? " says the Queen.

Word for word, he told her, and it was a sad hour when she heard the story. The two mourn together like a pair of ring-doves, and cannot be consoled.

When they see that with all their efforts they can make no advance, they say to one another, " Come, come, what's the good of behaving so childishly in the sight of everyone ? He has said it, and he will do it. Only let us give him our blessing, and bid him farewell. ' None can escape his fate.' "

So they summon him on the day that he was preparing to depart, and say to him :

" Darling of our hearts, we sought your welfare, but,

" ' Since go thou wilt, then fare thee well, good luck betide each hour,  
May roses fair bestrew thy path with many a fragrant flower.  
Thou golden eaglet, this alone we crave from thee : wherever  
Thy lot be cast, may nothing us from thy remembrance sever.' "

Then the pair fall on his neck, and embrace him fondly, and bedew him with their tears, and can hardly tear themselves away from him. At length they let him go, and tell him he has full power to take what he will along with him.

So he goes and chooses a good horse, takes a little money, and other necessaries, receives the blessing of his father and mother, and, with a " God bless you, dearest parents," is off and away.

The hapless King and Queen plunged themselves in mourning, and so did the whole country.

The Prince journeyed on for several days, till at length he reached a town.

He dismounts, and goes to refresh himself at a little coffee-house, in order that he may learn something about the place.

There enters a hawker with a beautiful golden casket, and cries it, saying, " This casket for sale ! whoever buys it will rue it ; and again, whoever does not buy it, will rue it : the price is a thousand ducats, no more and no less."

Then all who were in the coffee-house turned and looked at the Prince, and he says to himself, "Halloa, here is a start: 'whosoever buys it, shall rue it : and again, whosoever does not buy it shall rue it.' Well, I'll try my luck with it, anyhow, as I see all eyes are turned on me." Then he calls to the man : " Here, sir, what is the price of that casket ? "

" A thousand ducats, neither more nor less."

Then the Prince takes out his purse, and — chink, chink ! he counts a thousand ducats into our good hawker's hands, and takes the casket, and puts it in his pocket, with the words, " Time will show its worth."

He sits a while in the coffee-house, then he gets up and goes, after treating everyone all round, and that twice over. Well, what do you think ? What are you expecting ?

To make a short tale of it, he came to the town where the Fair One dwelt. He asks for information, and is told as follows : " My brave lad, have you no care for your young life ? she is a monster without her like. Her heart knows no relenting. Many and many a fine young fellow has she slain, and think you she will spare you ? However, as you are determined, go to the King, and let him tell you what to do."

So the Prince arose, and came to the King, and made his obeisance to him ; and the latter rises and bids him sit down beside him. And at once he took a fancy to him, for he was a fine-looking youth, and very accomplished. He asks him, what is his pleasure ?

And the lad replies, " I have come for your daughter."

" Ah, my son, that's a bad business. She's a witch, and wants to devour the world. I pray you begone ! "

" Nay, nay, nay! that's out of the question. Let me be slain."

But you see the King himself was weary of so much butchery ; and he sware to the Prince, that if she did not speak this time, he would kill her too.

Then the Prince's heart failed him, and he began to doubt of what he had done.

" But," said he (in the words of the proverb) :

" ' Oh ! last and latest thought of mine, why wast thou not my earliest ? '

Farewell, oh King ! "

" Good-bye, my son."

He departs, and goes to a coffee-house, full of thought, and rests his head on his hand.

As he did so, the casket was underneath; it struck against his elbow, and bruised his arm, so that it smarted a good deal. Then said he, " It is good for me to suffer. Did I not hear the hawker say, ' Whoever buys it, will rue it ? ' "

Then the casket answers, and says to him, " Tush, if you did not want me, why did you take me ? "

The Prince was like to lose his wits on hearing the casket talk.

" Don't be astonished," it continued, " I am your salvation. Only listen to what I tell you, and never fear. In the evening you will go to the Fair One's house. As soon as you enter, say, ' Good evening to you,' and see that you put me down somewhere, and afterwards begin to tell as many lies and stories as you can. She, meanwhile, will be sitting aloft by the glass cupboard, she sees you, and you don't see her, and she is as silent as a rock. Then you must say, ' Well, as the Princess doesn't deign to speak to us, won't you speak to us ? ' naming the object on which you have placed me. Then I will begin to talk to you, and you must ask me to tell you a tale, and I shall answer, ' I will, but on your honour, wall you pronounce a right judgement thereon ? ' and you must take good care and pronounce one that is altogether wrong. Then she will be indignant, and will speak.

" These, my words, do you obey,  
Write on paper what I say."

Then the Prince took heart, and longed for the evening to come. Till night drew on, the day seemed like a year, and when it grew dark — before you could count two, he was with the Princess.

A crowd hurried thither to watch the result from outside, and stood agape. The Prince entered with all politeness, and said, " Good evening, fair lady, light of my eyes ! How are you ? Won't you speak a word to me, the stranger ?

" 'Open thy lips, I pray thee, and speak but two words unto me,  
To ease me of these heartfelt pang?, that send their anguish through me.' "

In vain ! not a word was heard. Alas ! poor Prince,

" Fruitless are all thy strivings, to no purpose all thy pain,  
The fish that thou art fishing for, there is no way to gain."

However, while he was scraping and bowing, he managed to place the casket on the shelf, and again began :

"But, in the name of Heaven, is there no one here, not a soul to speak to me? I shall burst ! I cannot stand it." He makes a cigarette ; he makes another. No improvement !

" Ha ! what a heartless creature ! " they shout from outside. " How many braves have perished, and she does not loose her tongue ! Why a saint under vow of silence would speak ! "

" Troth," continues the Prince, " was it not I that used to have any number of men who would cudgel their brains to despair and tax their conversational powers to the utmost, just to amuse me; and now I have come to this nest of savages, to lose my life for nought ! Well spake my sire and my mother ! But since the Lady Princess will not speak with us — will not you, per chance, little shelf, speak a word with us, who are here all alone, and have no one to talk to ? "

"Gladly, master," answers the shelf; "if I would not speak for your sake, do you think I would for the sake of yonder wretch ? "

" Thanks, little shelf ! "

" What will you have ? — a song, a jest, or a little tale ? "

"Well, to pass the time, let's say — a tale."

" But allow me to say, master, that I shall ask you to deliver a fair judgement thereon ? "

"Now, little shelf, you have spoken a word that has stung me to the quick. Such a Prince as I am, and you tell me to give a fair judgement ? "

" Never mind ! Now for my story.

"The tale begins with wishing your honour good evening. Perish the witch over there," it adds aside.

It was torture to the Princess to behold all this, and to hear such grievous words ; she was like to burst. Meanwhile I am breaking the thread of our story, but no matter.

```

We now drop into the casket's first story:

```{admonition} The Golden Casket's First Tale
:class: dropdown seealso

" Once on a time. Prince, there were three fine young fellows, and all three had the same sweetheart without knowing it, and were also friends of one another. . They agree, accordingly, one day to go out into the country to a certain pleasure-garden to enjoy themselves. Do you hear, Prince ? " — and he bent himself to listen, like a gipsy's billhook, and his eye was fixed upon it.

"Ah, I forgot ! where did we stop ? Oh, I believe it was where they were about to go out into the country. Well, — but they wanted a little relish — you understand — so each one sends a lad to his sweetheart to bring him something to eat, without knowing she was the same. Well, do I not tell my story prettily ? "

"Charmingly!"

" Now, the good girl had a fowl in the oven, so she takes it and makes three portions of it. Does she know what she is doing ?

" ' Beards of hair  
Want comb and care.'

She also takes a little cheese and divides that, too, into three pieces, and a little loaf as well. Then she summons the first lad, takes one of the pieces of fowl, cheese, and bread, wraps it in a handkerchief, ties it up, and gives it to the boy, and goes away. Then she does the same with the next and the next, and the thing is done. The boys — who alone were not the same — take the handkerchiefs, they receive each a trifle for his trouble, and the young men go their way. Then our three friends set off on their journey, each with his handkerchief in his hand. They arrive at the pleasure-garden, whither they were bound. Then, when they had sat down comfortably, they open their handkerchiefs, and what should they behold — but all three the same ! ' Well, did I ever ? ' exclaimed each. Then all three were sore perplexed to get at the bottom of the matter ; for they seemed to smell the trick. ' Why, brother,' says the first, ' who is your sweetheart ? ' Says he, ' So and so.' At once the third exclaims, ' Halloa, that's mine ! ' ' No,' says the other, ' she's mine.'

" Goodness gracious, what a noise I what words, what shouting ! The three young men engage in a deadly quarrel ; they come to blows. Here's fine fun I Then one of them, who was more sensible than the others, said to them, ' Come, lads, is it not a shame that we should kill one another for a wench like that ? What mischief has possessed us ? Some evil eye must have looked at us to-day.' Then the wrath of the others seemed allayed somewhat, and they said, accordingly, ' How shall we settle this business ? ' ' Is it that which troubles you ? Well, my proposal is that each should take off his ring ; that we put them underneath this stone, and that then each one should journey forth, and after so many years that we should return hither to the same place, and that we should leave the rings as a pledge that we wait for one another, until we all three meet together, and that then the one who has learnt the best trade should marry her.' 'A good plan that ! ' say they, and leave their rings and go. So away they went, and each of them learnt a trade ; and after three years' space the three meet again in the same place. ' Thank God ! ' say they, ' that we have met again. Now let us see what we have been about.' Says one, ' I, my lads, have become a famous astrologer, and can tell all about every thing.' ' Bravo ! well done ! ' say the rest. The second says, ' I have become an eminent doctor, and can raise the very dead ! ' Says the third, ' I, in my turn, have learnt to run swifter than the wind ; and wherever I wish to be, there I am in a trice.' (Mercy on us, what clever devils ! it makes one's hair stand on end !) Then the three say, ' We are well ; but come, astrologer, look how fares it with our sweetheart ? ' Then the astrologer goes and gazes at her star, and trembles, and is like to fall (' For,' says he, 'some one's light is being quenched — he or she is dying ! ') ' Halloa, you fellows ! ' he shouts, ' she is at her last gasp ! ' ' Come, doctor ! ' they cry, ' physic, for God's sake, quick ! ' The doctor gathers a few herbs, and makes the medicine. ' Now you, who can go so quick, run for your life ! ' In a minute he arrives, pours the medicine down her mouth, and her soul, which had by this time reached her teeth, went down her throat again.

```

And then we return to the frame tale:

```{admonition} The Princess' First Response
:class: dropdown note

" Bless me, what a lot I know ! Wasn't that a fine story ? Now it's your turn to tell me (for I fain would know) which of the three ought to marry her? and I wish you joy of your answer."

He pretends to reflect, and says at length, " Which should marry her ? Which should marry her ? Why the astrologer should marry her ! "

Then the Princess was in such a torment of indignation, that she uttered such shrieks as made the windows shake. It was, " Spill egg, or burst ! "

" I have you now ! " says the Prince.

" I wish you joy of your just judgement, Sir Prince ! " says she.

"What are you thinking of? Why, if it had not been for that swift runner, of what avail would have been the astrology and the medicine? So let the last one take her!" And she was silent again.

Then you might have heard the clap ! clap ! clap ! of many hands. " The Princess has spoken ! " They run to the King. On hearing the news, the King distributed bounties wholesale, and cried, " Glory be to God for changing her mind ! "

Then the Prince, on his part, secretly takes away the casket, and with the words, " That scores one for us ! " departs, — for the wager was to make her speak three times. This was the condition of success. The Prince goes to the King, who embraces him, and says, " Henceforth you are my son. As she has spoken the first time, the others will follow of themselves." And now there was nothing but rejoicings and carousals. Well, what next ? The second evening came ; but now he had more courage, and said again, " Good evening to you ! " and much else, as on the first occasion, and a great deal more beside. But I forgot to tell you one curious circumstance. When they were all gone, and the Princess was left alone, she got up and descended from her perch, and was in such a passion that the very stones were an offence to her. She went to the shelf, and said to it, " Come, little shelf, won't you speak to me ? " But why expect words from wood ? Then she nearly choked with passion. " You precious torment ! I have had you all these years, and I never remember to have heard you speak a single word to please me ; and that fellow that you only saw last night, with him you began to chatter ! — take that for your pains, with my compliments." And smash ! smash ! she breaks the shelf into a thousand splinters, and all the things upon it are sent about their business. You see it was enough to put a saint into a fury. Confusion seize upon her, the silly wench !

On that evening he placed the casket on a chair, and he spoke and spoke again, for his tongue was bolder than before. " Talk ! talk ! " said he. " Ah, I shall burst with anger again this evening. I have no company. Last night I had my little shelf; but this evening I see it nowhere. Has that turned against me, too ? "

" ' All wish me ill ! the stocks and stones their humnan malice aiding.  
And if 1 lean against a tree, the leaves do fall a fading;.'

Well, the Princess will speak to me no more ! But you, my little chair, have not. you a word to say to me ? "

" Right gladly, Master, I am at your service. What sort of talk do you wish me to begin with you ? Shall I tell you a tale to console you, so that the night may pass somewhat more quickly? I will do so, Prince, but I desire a just decision on what I tell you."

"It's too bad to talk to me in that way. I am not a mere child without sense. I am a full-grown Prince, and shall I not give you a just judgement ? "

```

And so begins the casket's second tale:

```{admonition} The Golden Casket's Second Tale
:class: dropdown seealso

" Ah, pardon me, and let me begin my story. My story begins by wishing you good evening, my pretty master. Once on a time there were three companions, each of a different calling. One was a monk, one was a carpenter, and one was a tailor. They decided on leaving that country, as they could not get on there any longer, and on going to another place, where there might be a demand for their services. So our good friends arose, and set off for the town in question. They walked all that day, and at evening came to a farm. They decided that they must stay there for that night and would go fonvard in pursuit of their business on the following morning. But you see they were afraid of all going to sleep at once, for in those parts robbers were known to be about, and fears prevailed all around. What then should they do ? They determined to cast lots, and that each should watch in his turn, while the other two slept. The lots are cast, and the first falls on the carpenter. The monk and the tailor slept, and the carpenter kept watch. He sat and sat, but soon began to nod. In order to enliven himself and to frighten the tailor, whose turn came next, he took a block of wood which was near the sheep-fold, got his tools, and carved it into the figure of a maiden, and set it up in front of the fold. When his hour was past, he woke the tailor, saying ' Wake up you, and watch ' a bit. ' So he lay down himself, and the tailor got up. Some time passed before he saw anything in particular. At last, when his eyes were thoroughly opened, he turned and beheld the figure. At first he thought, in his terror, that the robbers were there, and shouted, ' To arms ! to arms, lads ! They have come to attack us ! ' But he sees that it does not move from its place, and takes courage.

" Then he throws a stone, which struck as though upon wood, which it really was. ' A nice trick that devil of a carpenter has played me, and I was near making a fine mess of it in my fear. However, he has made this figure, and now what shall I do ? ' Then he opened his bag and took out some of the materials and instruments of his trade, and made a dress for the figure, and clothed it, so that if you had seen it, you would have said it was alive.

" But you see, it was not able to speak.

" By the time he had done all this, his time had passed, and he woke up the monk.

" The poor monk gets up, and sees in the sheep-fold a girl in full array, only one thing was wanting lo her, and that was life.

" Now the monk understood this, and he put up a prayer to God out of a pure heart. God heard him, and granted his request. Now attend ! In the morning, the other two get up, and the three fight together as to who had the first cl^im to her.

"The carpenter said, ' She belongs to me, because she was a wooden block, and I made her what she is.'

" The tailor said, ' Nay, but she belongs to me, because I spent so much on clothing her, who else would be naked.'

" Finally, the monk begins to talk like a divine, ' God bless you, my sons, will you not leave her to me, who have no one, and am all by myself? You have your wives, your children, all joy to you with them ! but whom have I ? '

"They clamour, and refuse to hear him.

" I want, therefore, to learn which of them ought by right to take her?"

```

Once again, the casket has broken the fourth wall *within the story* and directed a question to the Prince:

```{admonition} The Princess' Second Response
:class: dropdown note

" Bah ! such a trifle need not puzzle your head ! The poor tailor ought to have her, for he broke his needle, and made his fingers sore in sewing her clothes together."

At hearing this again, the Princess calls out, "I want to speak once more ! For I can't understand such absurdity. Alas, for you, young man ! I am sorry for the honour of your name, but you don't seem to know how many days there are in a year I Why look at the absurdity of the thing ! While he doesn't know the evil things his destiny has in store for him, he speaks big boastful words ; but that's a wise saying :

" ' Where you hear of many cherries,  
Hold small baskets for the berries.'

[i.e. Much cry, little wool]

" Only I beg you will not come near me again to vex my soul with any more of your nonsense."

Then he says to her, " Since your ladyship has spoken, I am content."

So he puts the casket in his bosom and — catch him if you can — he's off in a jiffey to the King. Our fair damsel comes down from her perch ; and falls to fighting with the chair until she has reduced it to atoms. Ah, well, let's see what happens on the following evening ; as everything now depends on that, lest we lose all our labour now, and the fruits of our labour in the past. From early morn she washes herself, combs her hair, puts on her best attire, and when evening was come —

" Tree of beauty, cypress tree, accept me for your peer ! "

Again he says, " Good evening to you. Princess ! Peradventure you are still angry with me from last evening. I made a mistake, but afterwards I recognised it myself, so pray forgive me for offending you. Only speak to me one word, to heal my wounded heart. Nay, wait a bit. It is as though I understood to-night, how to turn my very soul inside out. What shall I say to my fate that wrote so many bitter things against me ! But here is that will tell me."

He places the casket on the candle-stick and as he poured forth these complaints the candle-stick replied, "Patience, Prince ! "

" ' What patience, patience, ever more ? how long is that to be ?  
Behold the work of patience, what it has done to me ! ' "

answers the Prince.

" Never mind her up there," it replies, " and I will sing and dance for you the live-long night, end don't trouble yourself four rushes about yonder witch, only tell me what I can do for you."

" What shall I say ? Will you tell me a tale to pass the night away ? "

" As you like master, but I want you to pass a just judgement on it."

" Never fear ! "


```

And so begins the casket's third tale:

```{admonition} The Golden Casket's Third Tale
:class: dropdown seealso

" Well then : once on a time (may the Holy Virgin protect you, Prince) there was a King and a Queen. They had a daughter, whom they gave to a foster mother to bring it up in a castle. The girl grew up, and one day, when her wet-nurse was combing her hair, she finds a lady-bird. Do you suppose such as she would know a ladybird when they saw it ?

" ' What's that ? ' says she ? when the nurse showed it her.

" ' Why my darling it's a lady-bird.'

" ' Let's keep it, mama, to see if it will grow ver}' large.'

" ' Oh, they don't grow child ! '

" ' Well but I insist tKat you put it in that vessel that we may see what it comes to.'

" So they put it in and kept it, and lo and behold it got so big it filled the whole jug, and they put in a larger one ; then into a cask — and to make a short tale of a long one — it grew into an ox. Then they thought it was time to slaughter it and to pre- serve its skin, so that no one would know what it was. They call a butcher and say to him :

" ' Slay this beast for us, and skin it, and throw the remains away.'

" So he slaughters it and skins it without knowing what manner of beast it was. They pay him oif, and he goes about his business. They pickle, dry and preserve the skin. Some years passed away, and the maiden was of age to marry. But the Devil put it into her head that she would not marry, and in order that her father might not bother her every day with proposals, she tells him that she has a skin, and whoever can find out what animal it belonged to, him she«will marry: otherwise he must lose his head.

" ' So be it,' said he.

" For he supposed that would be the easiest thing in the world, and how was he to know what was in the wind ? So the King issues a proclamation, ' Whoever shall be found to guess my daughter's riddle " (a similar case to yours and that of this lady now, who arches her neck like a gipsy's billhook !) ; but it remained impossible for any one to guess it, and many and many were slain daily, princes and sons of viziers. Neither God nor the Devil desired such bloodshed for the sake of one woman ; but the Devil took the shape of a handsome young fellow, and he straightway goes and sues for the hand of the maiden; a youth so fair to look on that whoever beheld him, his eyes would be enchained by his beauty.

" The King sees him, the Queen sees him, the nurse sees him.

" 'Oh, my eyes,' they cry, 'what a beautiful youth ! Would that he might guess the riddle, and wed our maiden, that she might live with him to a good old age ! '

" Never fear but he will succeed. You know they say, ' God judges in His own good time ! ' And now she has shed such torrents of blood— is it ever to be so ? ' What a man sows, that shall he reap;' (These sayings don't belong to the story, but are proverbs of my own, for I have seen and known their truth). So the handsome youth goes, with all gravity, and asks what the riddle is. A fluttering at the heart seized the Princess lest he guess it. Our friend says at once, ' Bah ! why that's the skin of a lady-bird !' "

" Bravo ! bravo ! he has guessed it ! " assents the Princess.

"The very same evening they make ready to marry them. They ate, they drank, they caroused ; the hour for bed-time came. The Princess went to bed, while he turned to a black negro, and slept in the further part of the room, without touching her with his little finger.

" The greater part of the Princess' blood had congealed from fright before daylight broke. When the dawn had come, he again became what he was before, and the girl, though overwhelmed with grief, said nothing to her father, in order to see how matters, would turn out ; but when she sees how next night things were the same, and worse, ' Eh ! ' said she to herself, ' this can neither be eaten nor chewed ; ' and she runs to her father, and tells him how matters stand, and begs him to call her husband, and inquire into the case.

"So the King calls him, and asks him how it is ; and he answers that he is under a curse pronounced on him by his father, and hence his affliction : he begged him to leave him the Princess, that she might go and find his father, and win his blessing, that so he might be delivered from the plague, after which, he would return. Then he obtains the Princess : the King gives him a body-guard into the bargain, and he takes his leave. As they were journeying in a wilderness, he changes into a demon, and says, 'Wife, I am hungry !' and straightway he gobbles up all the food they had. They go further, and again he cries, ' Wife, I am hungry ! ' and he gobbles up all the men of their escort, along with their horses, and only leaves his wife. Then he brought her to a place, where he lifted up a marble slab, and underneath there was a cave; and he put her inside, and covered her up. Alas, unhappy Princess, what sights were there to see ! She sees slain beasts, she sees the flesh of men, she sees things that filled her soul with horror. Afterwards the monster comes and lifts the marble slab, and comes in and gives her human flesh to eat, and turns into a snake, and winds himself round her from her foot up to her head, and puts out his tongue, and thrusts it into her mouth, and sucks her blood. When the night was past he leaves her again, and departs.

" But she was at death's door. Now when she left the palace she had taken with her, as a token of her mother's blessing, two ring-doves, which she carried in her bosom ; and nothing else remained to her for her solace but these two ring-doves ; and she thought to take a piece of paper, and write a letter to her mother, telling her the state of the case, and to tie it to the claw of one of the ring-doves, and let it go when the monster should leave, and if he did not discover. it, hoped that something might turn up. So she takes the piece of paper, and ties it to its claw, and lets it go away along with the monster ; the poor dove tries to fly out as he lifts the marble, but he perceiyes it, and swallows the bird whole. The next day she lets the other bird go. That one, by her mother's blessing, escaped, as luck would have it, and flew, and flew, and flew, and perched at the window of the Princess' castle.

" Then her mother sees it, and says, ' Halloa ! that is my daughter's dove that has come back ! Run and bring it in.' It was as though the poor thing understood,' for, instead of flying away, it remained still, and they catch it, and bring it to the Queen. She kissed it fondly, and caressed it, and asked it, ' How fares your mistress ? ' As she was caressing and stroking it, she sees the paper wrapped round its claw ; she unties it, and what does she read ? Lamentation and woe ! Her cry went down to earth, and up to heaven. The King hastens to her side. ' What's the matter ? what's the matter ? ' says he, and she gives him the paper, and weeps, and groans, ' Ah, my daughter, my daughter ! in what a sad plight art thou ! and who shall rescue thee ? '

" Forthwith a proclamation goes forth into the town, that whosoever shall be able to bring the King his daughter, shall take her to wife. But no one can be heard of. There is no room here for deception ! Lamentation and wailing resound through all the town. There was there a certain poor old dame, and she had seven sons, and verily, every one of them was a hero. You must know they had been absent for seven years, and, by good fortune, they chanced to come home that same year. They see the whole place in mourning, and do not know the reason. They ask two or three people, ' My friends, what's the matter here ? ' and learn the state of affairs. They go home, and their first word was that their mother must go to the King, and tell him her sons are equal to the task of bringing him back his daughter. ' My dear children,' says their mother, ' you have been all these years away from me, and the grief of your absence consumed me ; and scarcely have you come, when you want to go away again. It is no proper business for you, that you are after. And she, they say, is in a horrid place, where not even a gnat can enter.' They answer her, ' We told you to go to the King, and are you still sitting there ? ' What could the poor woman do ? Willing, or unwilling, she goes to the King and tells him. The King was delighted to hear such good news, and loaded her with hand- some gifts, and told her that if God grants them success, and they get back his daughter, one of them shall have her to wife, and the others shall share the half of his kingdom ; and whatever they require for their journey, let them come and ask for it. She goes and tells her sons, and they cannot be off soon enough. Now you must understand that at the time of their absence they had not remained idle, like some people, but each had learned a magic art, and this was why they now felt no concern. Here is a list of their accomplishments. One had learnt to put his ear to the ground and find out what was taking place in the under world. The next could lift such a load with his hands, that if even the earth had but a brass handle, he could raise it. The third was so clever and dexterous that he could strip a man asleep without his being aware of it. The fourth had such a pair of shoulders that whatever weight you put upon them he did not feel it. Another had the art of striking his hand upon the earth, so as to make an iron castle spring up, which did not care even for thunderbolts. Another, again, could aim at an object no bigger than a midge upon the devil's thigh, and bring it down. — I'm sure I don't know how many we have now, — will you count them, Prince ? That's a wise saying, 'I give the blows, and you count them,' for there's no knowing what mistakes may happen any hour. But I fancy there is yet one left, yes, — the last, who, if anything fell from the sky, and he opened his arms, it would tumble into them. He made it come to him, like that thing that draws iron to itself, the name of which I don't remember. My word, what a devil's brood ! What arts they had picked up among them ! Bravo, old dame's sons!

" Well, when they had set out on their journey, they said to the one that could overhear the doings of the under world, ' Find out where we are going, so that we may not journey in the dark ; but may arrive an hour in advance, lest the hare give us the slip, and we lose all the fun ! '

" ' We are going on all right, but we have not gone far enough yet'

" So they journey on and on, and again they ask, ' Now have another look ! '

" ' Eh, my lads, we are getting near,' said he ; ' it's just behind that mountain there.' Forward, forward ! Our young heroes behold the marble slab which was over the cave, and — Heaven preserve us — it was two or three times the size of our house." When they arrived at the spot, they cried, ' Now you who lift the weights — raise up that marble slab.! '

" So he took it up by a brass ring which was attached to it and lifted it clean off, but very softly, so that they might not hear him down below.

" Then the one who heard what was doing in the under world said, that the monster was at present a snake, and was coiled round the njaiden: arid sucking' her. blood with its tongue.

" Then they said, ' Ho ! you, who cannot be seen ; quick, get you down.'

" So he went down below, took the serpent by his tail, and little by little he uncoiled it from her body, without being perceived ; but the girl was by this time half dead. Then he comes up and says, 'She is now ready for raising,' and at once the one who lifted heavy weights went down, and took her on his shoulders, and made off with all haste. The day dawns, and then the snake sees what has happened. ' Ha ! you dogs !' he shouts; ;the Old woman's sons have carried her off ! '

"For it seems he knew that they were his fated foes; and straightway he changes to a cloud, and pursues them. Then the long-eared one gets wind of his coming, and says, ' Oho my lads ! he is awake and after us ! ' Scarcely had he uttered the word when the black cloud loomed in sight. Then they cry, ' Ho ! you who can rear a tower with a clap of your hands, quick, or we have lost her ! ' In a moment the fine fellow claps down his hand, and a tower rose which was a terror to behold. They all went into it ; and there came the cloud, and made a noise and an uproar, that shook the tower to its base, but what did they care ? By this time all the young heroes were wearied out, and wished to take a little nap, to rest themselves. So they said to the maiden, ' You see we are going to lie down to sleep. Be well on your guard, and don't look out at the window, or woe betide you ! It will be the worse for you.'

" It was as though they had said to her, ' As soon as we are gone to sleep, mind you look out at the window,' for the foul fiend, when he had tried every artifice and could accomplish nothing, changed to an old woman, with a brood of golden birds, and kept casting pearls to them, which they ate, and. made such, sweet music it was ravishing to hear.

"Then had it been myself, I must have had a peep, to say nothing of the Princess ; who had been so many days in hell, and longed to have a look at the world. But why do they call them devils? Because with their arts they deceive the world. The poor girl goes to peep out, and see! The black cloud seizes her, and mounts up aloft as high as it can. Then the young braves ' wake up, they seek the maiden. Where is she ? She can nowhere be seen or heard. The tower builder strikes on the floor, the tower vanishes ; they look this way, they look that — not a sign of her. Then they turn their eyes aloft, and behold our friend the fiend carrying the girl up into the clouds, at such a height that he now looked about the size of an onion. They shout, ' Ho there ! you who have a good aim ! Quick, or we shall lose them.' But he answers, ' Let them alone, let them get a bit further.' They rose higher still, till they were scarcely seen at all, and then he shoots his arrow, 'arid it goes and strikes the monster right in the breast just where the heart is, and in a moment they see them come tumbling down together. Then the other one opens his arms, and in a little while afterwards down falls the fiend as well, and is dashed to pieces, and so they, too, were rescued from his clutches. Then they cheer up the maiden and bring her to her father. Now then, I prithee, tell me, master, who has a right to marry the maiden ? "

Again, the cask breaks out of the story and returns out attention to the Prince... and the Princess:

```{admonition} The Princess' Third and Final Response
:class: dropdown note

He thought and thought and at length he said, " It is right that he should take her who carried her such a way."

At hearing this again the Princess took fire and was in a burning rage. Then she said, " Now that is too bad ! I am doomed to lose my life for this brat of a foreign woman ! Good sir, didn't I tell you not to presume to show your face again in my presence to set my heart aflame ? Why do you come and drivel away in here, and spoil other people's humour, for I'm blessed if you know a hen's tail from its beak ! "

" All right, my lady, now the whole thing is over."

And wherever you went you heard nothing else but, "The Princess has spoken." Let the Prince thank his casket for his luck, for it was that which made a man of him. Then the King orders his daughter to wash herself, and comb herself, and put on her best attire, for at eventide he would have her married. So the maiden made ready, and in the evening he married her to the Prince, and there was laughter and joy and grand carousal. A few days later the Prince asks leave to go and see his father and mother, to comfort them in their grief and anguish. "By all means," says his father-in-law, "and take your wife with you." So the Prince sets off with the Princess, and they come to his father. When the poor unhappy parents saw their son coming whom they had long given up for lost, they were almost crazy with joy. Then the King took off his crown and put it on his son's head, and the mother did the same to the daughter, and henceforward, free from torment and mishap they lived a right merry life ; and may we live a better one still, for neither I nor you were there to know whether it was true.
