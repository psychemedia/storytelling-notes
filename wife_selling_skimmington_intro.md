# Wife Sales, Rough Music and Skimminton Rides - Intro

One of my favourite period settings for traditional tales are the anywhen tales that seem to fit against an early nineteenth century rural backdrop, in the valleys of my youth around West Yorkshire, perhaps, or the valleys of Wales. Where you can imageine the damp, the stone houses and stone walls, the dirty greens and mist in the air, of the landscapes Ashley Jackson still paints today.

Even if the period is not explicitly stated, it comes through in the setting of the tale, and before that, the wider framing. And in the choice of words that are driven from the describing the scene as I imagine it, and construct it.

And as I go deeper into this storytelling lark, I want to have a keener sense of the possoble worlds I am describing so as to better reflect them in the tales I am telling, and also, perhaps, to help me better pick up on some of the context that would have accentuated the tales, or placed them in a particular sort of relief, when they were told a hundred and fifty years or more ago.

So that's one of the reasons I've started delving deeper into news reports and social history of life in the nineteenth century; and another reason, of course, is that there are some fantastic tales to tell buried in local histories...

TO DO - Thompson, Commons, what I see..

TO DO thise things that everybody knew that either wasn't mentioned, because everybody would have know that was part of the context, was alluded to, but you only recondgnise that if you are sensitsed to it, or that is alluded to, but you don't know what it it (like online news stories todays that obliquely but obviiously refer to something that can't be reported in the news media for legal reasons but can be easily discoverd if you do a web search for it, and may even be a trending story on algorithmically driven web sites. )

 TO DO

> THERE is no myth relative to the manners and customs of the English that in my experience is more tenaciously held by the ordinary Frenchman than that the sale of a wife in the market-place is an habitual and an accepted fact in English life.
>
> It is â€” so far as my experience goes â€” quite useless to assure a Frenchman that such transfer of wives is not a matter of everyday occurrence, and is not legal: he replies with an expression of incredulity, that of course English people endeavour to make light of, or deny, a fact that is "notorious."
