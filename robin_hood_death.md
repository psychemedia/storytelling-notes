# The Death of Robin Hood


https://chaucer.fas.harvard.edu/robin-hoods-death

A late and fragmentary version of the death of Robin Hood, preserved in the Percy Folio Manuscript, ed. Hales and Furnivall, I, 53.

'I will neuer eate nor drinke,' Robin Hood said,  
'Nor meate will doo me noo good,  
Till I haue beene att merry Churchlees,  
My vaines for to let blood.'  

'That I reade not,' said Will Scarllett,  
'Master, by the assente of me,  
Without halfe a hundred of your best bowmen  
You take to goe with yee.  

'For there a good yeoman doth abide  
Will be sure to quarrell with thee,  
And if thou haue need of vs, master,  
In faith we will not flee.'  

'And thou be feard, thou William Scarlett,  
Att home I read thee bee:'  
'And you be wrothe, my deare master,  
You shall neuer heare more of mee.'  

'For there shall noe man with me goe,  
Nor man with mee ryde,  
And Litle Iohn shall be my man,  
And beare my benbow by my side.'  

'You'st beare your bowe, master, your selfe,  
And shoote for a peny with mee:'  
'To that I doe assent,' Robin Hood sayd,  
'And soe, Iohn, lett it bee.'  

They two bolde children shotten together,  
All day theire selfe in ranke,  
Vntill they came to blacke water,  
And over it laid a planke.  

Vpon it there kneeled an old woman,  
Was banning Robin Hoode;  
'Why dost thou bann Robin Hoode?' said Robin,  
. . . .  

[Nine stanzas missing; contents unknown.]  

. . . . .  
'To giue to Robin Hoode;  
Wee weepen for his deare body,  
That this day must be lett bloode.'  

'The dame prior is my aunts daughter,  
And nie vnto my kinne;  
I know shee wold me noe harme this day,  
For all the world to winne.'  

Forth then shotten these children two,  
And they did neuer lin,  
Vntill they came to merry Churchless,  
To merry Churchlee[s] with-in.  

And when they came to merry Charchlees,  
They knoced vpon a pin;  
Vpp then rose dame prioresse,  
And lett good Robin in.  

Then Robin gaue to dame prioresse  
Twenty pound in gold,  
And bad her spend while that wold last,  
And shee shold haue more when shee wold.  

And downe then came dame prioresse,  
Downe she came in that ilke,  
With a pair off blood-irons in her hands,  
Were wrapped all in silke.  

'Sett a chaffing-dish to the fyer,' said dame prioresse,  
And stripp thou vp thy sleeue:'  
I hold him but an vnwise man  
That will noo warning leeve.  

Shee laid the blood-irons to Robin Hoods vaine,  
Alacke, the more pitye!  
And pearct the vaine, and let out the bloode,  
That full red was to see.  

And first it bled, the thicke, thicke bloode,  
And afterwards the thinne,  
And well then wist good Robin Hoode  
Treason there was within.  

'What cheere my master?' said Litle Iohn;  
'In faith, Iohn, litle goode  
. . . .  

[Again nine stanzas are missing; content unknown.]  

'I haue upon a gowne of greene,  
Is cut short by my knee,  
And in my hand a bright browne brand  
That will well bite of the.'  

But forth then of a shot-windowe  
Good Robin Hood he could glide;  
Red Roger, with a grounden glaue,  
Thrust him through the milke-white side.  

But Robin was light and nimble of foote,  
And thought to abate his pride,  
Ffor betwixt his head and his shoulders  
He made a wound full wide.  

Says, 'Ly there, ly there, Red Roger,  
The doggs they must thee eate;  
For I may have my houzle,' he said,  
'For I may both goe and speake.  

'Now giue me mood,' Robin said to Litle Iohn,  
'Giue me mood with thy hand;  
I trust to God in heauen soe hye  
My houzle will me bestand.'  

'Now giue me leaue, giue me leaue, master,' he said,  
'For Christs loue giue leaue to me,  
To set a fier within this hall,  
And to burne up all Churchlee.'  

'That I reade not,' said Robin Hoode then,  
'Litle Iohn, for it may not be;  
If I shold doe any widow hurt, at my latter end,  
God,' he said, 'wold blame me;  

'But take me vpon thy backe, Litle Iohn,  
And beare me to yonder streete,  
And there make me full fayre graue,  
Of grauell and of grete.  

'And sett my bright sword at my head,  
Mine arrowes at my feete.  
And lay my vew-bow by my side,  
My met-yard wi . . .

A Gest of Robyn Hode (Regularized)

...

Robin dwelled in green-wood  
Twenty year and two;  
For all dread of Edward our king,  
Again would he not go.

Yet he was beguiled, i-wys,  
Through a wicked woman,  
The prioress of Kirkesly,  
That nigh was of his kin.

For the love of a knight,  
Sir Roger of Donkesly,  
That was her own special;  
Full evil may they thee!

They took together their counsel  
Robin Hood for to slay,  
And how they might best do that deed,  
His banes for to be.

Than bespoke good Robin,  
In place where as he stood,  
`To morrow I must to Kyrkesly,  
Craftily to be leten blood.'

Sir Roger of Donkestere,  
By the prioress he lay,  
And there they betrayed good Robin Hood,  
Through their false play.

Christ have mercy on his soul,  
That died on the rood!  
For he was a good outlaw,  
And did pore men much god.

Robin Hood: a collection of poems, songs, and ballads relative to that celebrated English outlaw

XXVIII ROBIN HOOD'S DEATH AND BURIAL:

"Shewing how he was taken ill, and how he went to his cousin at Kirkley-hall, who let him blood, which was the cause of his death. Tune of *Robin Hoods last farewel, &c.*"

This very old and curious piece is preserved solely in the editions of "Robin Hood's garland," printed at York, where it is made to conclude with some foolish lines, (adopted from the London copy of the preceding ballad,) in order to introduce the epitaph. It is here given from a collation of two different copies, containing numerous variations, a few of which are retained in the margin.

When Robin Hood and Little John,  
*Down a down, a down, a down,*  
Went o'er yon bank of broom.  
Said Robin Hood to Little John,  
We have shot for many a pound:
*Hey down, a down, a down.*

But I am not able to shoot one shot more,  
My arrows will not flee;  
But I have a cousin lives down below,  
Please god, she will bleed me.

Now Robin is to fair Kirkley gone,  
As fast as he can win;  
But before he came there, as we do hear,  
He was taken very ill.

And when that he came to fair Kirkley-hall,  
He knock'd all at the ring,  
But none was so ready as his cousin herself,  
For to let bold Robin in.

Will you please to sit down, cousin Robin, she said,  
And drink some beer with me?  
"No, I will neither eat nor drink,  
Till I am blooded by thee." `[Till I blood letted be.]`

Well, I have a room, cousin Robin, she said,  
Which you did never see,  
And if you please to walk therein,  
You blooded by me shall be. `[You blood shall letted be.]`

She took him by the lilly-white hand,  
And let him to a private room,  
And there she blooded bold Robin Hood,  
Whilst one drop of blood would run.

She blooded him in the vein of the arm,  
And locked him up in the room;  
There did he bleed all the live-long day,  
Untill the next day at noon.

He then bethought him of a casement door,  
Thinking for to be gone `[get down]`,  
He was so weak he could not leap,  
Nor he could not get down.

He then bethought him of his bugle-horn,  
Which hung low down to his knee,  
He set his horn unto his mouth,  
And blew out weak blasts three.

Then Little John, when hearing him,  
As he sat under the tree,  
I fear my master is near dead,  
He blows so wearily."

Then Little John to fair Kirkley is gone,  
As fast as he can dree;  
But when he came to Kirkley-hall,  
He broke locks two or three:  

Untill he came bold Robin to,  
Then he fell on his knee;  
A boon, a boon, cries Little John,  
Master, I beg of thee.

What is that boon, quoth Robin Hood,  
Little John, thou begs of me?  
It is to burn fair Kirkley-hall,  
And all their nunnery."

Now nay, now nay, quoth Robin Hood,  
That boon I'll not grant thee;  
I never 'hurt' `[burnt]` woman in all my life,  
Nor man in woman's company.

I never hurt fair maid in all my time,  
Nor at my end shall it be;  
But give me my bent bow in my hand,  
And a broad arrow I'll let flee;  
And where this arrow is taken up,  
There shall my grave digg'd be.

Lay me a green sod under my head, `[With verdant sods most neatly put,]`  
And another at my feet; `[Sweet as the green wood tree.]`  
And lay my bent bow by my side,  
Which was my music sweet;  
And make my grave of gravel and green,  
Which is most right and meet.

Let me have length and breadth enough,  
With a green sod under my head;  
That they may say, when I am dead,  
Here lies bold Robin Hood.

These words they readily promis'd him,  
Which did bold Robin please:  
And there they buried bold Robin Hood,
Near to the fair Kirkleys.

YAr.ious Readings.— FF. 67, 6i?.—

 Sweet as the green wood tree.

CHAPTER XXIV HOW ROBIN HOOD MET HIS DEATH

"Give me my bent bow in my hand,  
And a broad arrow I'll let flee;  
And where this arrow is taken up,  
There shall my grave digg'd be."

NOW by good rights this story should end with the wedding of Robin Hood and Maid Marian; for do not many pleasant tales end with a wedding and the saying, "and they lived happy ever after"? But this is a true account—in so far as we can find the quaint old ballads which tell of it—and so we must follow one more of these songs and learn how Robin, after living many years longer, at last came to seek his grave. And the story of it runs in this wise.

Robin Hood and his men, now the Royal Archers, went with King Richard of the Lion Heart through England settling certain private disputes which had arisen among the Norman barons while the King was gone to the Holy Land. Then the King proceeded amid great pomp and rejoicing to the palace at London, and Robin, the new Earl of Huntingdon, brought his Countess thither where she became one of the finest ladies of the Court.

The Royal Archers were now divided into two bands, and one-half of them were retained in London, while the other half returned to Sherwood and Barnesdale, there to guard the King's preserves.

Several months passed by, and Robin began to chafe under the restraint of city life. He longed for the fresh pure air of the greenwood, and the rollicking society of his yeomen. One day, upon seeing some lads at archery practice upon a green, he could not help but lament, saying, "Woe is me! I fear my hand is fast losing its old time cunning at the bow-string!"

Finally he became so distraught that he asked leave to travel in foreign lands, and this was granted him. He took Maid Marian with him, and together they went through many strange countries. Finally in an Eastern land a great grief came upon Robin. Marian sickened of a plague and died. They had been married but five years, and Robin felt as though all the light had gone out of his life.

He wandered about the world for a few months longer, trying to forget his grief, then came back to the court, at London, and sought some commission in active service. But, unluckily, Richard was gone again upon his adventures, and Prince John, who acted as Regent, had never been fond of Robin. He received him with a sarcastic smile.

"Go forth into the greenwood," said he, coldly, "and kill some more of the King's deer. Belike, then, the King will make you Prime Minister, at the very least, upon his return."

The taunt fired Robin's blood. He had been in a morose mood, ever since his dear wife's death. He answered Prince John hotly, and the Prince bade his guards seize him and cast him into the Tower.

After lying there for a few weeks, he was released by the faithful Stutely and the remnant of the Royal Archers, and all together they fled the city and made their way to the greenwood. There Robin blew the old familiar call, which all had known and loved so well. Up came running the remainder of the band, who had been Royal Foresters, and when they saw their old master they embraced his knees and kissed his hands, and fairly cried for joy that he had come again to them. And one and all forswore fealty to Prince John, and lived quietly with Robin in the greenwood, doing harm to none and only awaiting the time when King Richard should come again.

But King Richard came not again, and would never need his Royal Guard more. Tidings presently reached them, of how he had met his death in a foreign land, and how John reigned as King in his stead. The proof of these events followed soon after, when there came striding through the glade the big, familiar form of Little John.

"Art come to arrest us?" called out Robin, as he ran forward and embraced his old comrade.

"Nay, I am not come as the Sheriff of Nottingham, thanks be," answered Little John. "The new King has deposed me, and 'tis greatly to my liking, for I have long desired to join you here again in the greenwood."

Then were the rest of the band right glad at this news, and toasted Little John royally.

The new King waged fierce war upon the outlaws, soon after this, and sent so many scouting parties into Sherwood and Barnesdale that Robin and his men left these woods for a time and went into Derbyshire, near Haddon Hall. A curious pile of stone is shown to this day as the ruins of Robin's Castle, where the bold outlaw is believed to have defied his enemies for a year or more. At any rate King John found so many troubles of his own, after a time, that he ceased troubling the outlaws.

But in one of the last sorties Robin was wounded. The cut did not seem serious, and healed over the top; but it left a lurking fever. Daily his strength ebbed away from him, until he was in sore distress.

One day as he rode along on horseback, near Kirklees Abbey, he was seized with so violent a rush of blood to the head that he reeled and came near falling from his saddle. He dismounted weakly and knocked at the Abbey gate. A woman shrouded in black peered forth.

"Who are you that knock here? For we allow no man within these walls," she said.

"Open, for the love of Heaven!" he begged. "I am Robin Hood, ill of a fever and in sore straits."

At the name of Robin Hood the woman started back, and then, as though bethinking herself, unbarred the door and admitted him. Assisting his fainting frame up a flight of stairs and into a front room, she loosed his collar and bathed his face until he was revived. Then she spoke hurriedly in a low voice:

"Your fever will sink, if you are bled. See, I have provided a lancet and will open your veins, while you lie quiet."

So she bled him, and he fell into a stupor which lasted nearly all that day, so that he awoke weak and exhausted from loss of blood.

Now there is a dispute as to this abbess who bled him. Some say that she did it in all kindness of heart; while others aver that she was none other than the former Sheriff's daughter, and found her revenge at last in this cruel deed.

Be that as it may, Robin's eyes swam from very weakness when he awoke. He called wearily for help, but there was no response. He looked longingly through the window at the green of the forest; but he was too weak to make the leap that would be needed to reach the ground,

He then bethought him of his horn,  
Which hung down at his knee;  
He set his horn unto his mouth,  
And blew out weak blasts three.

Little John was out in the forest near by, or the blasts would never have been heard. At their sound he sprang to his feet.

"Woe! woe!" he cried, "I fear my master is near dead, he blows so wearily!"

So he made haste and came running up to the door of the abbey, and knocked loudly for admittance. Failing to get reply he burst in the door with frenzied blows of his mighty fist, and soon came running up to the room where Robin lay, white and faint.

"Alas, dear master!" cried Little John in great distress; "I fear you have met with treachery! If that be so, grant me one last boon, I pray."

"hat is it?" asked Robin.

"Let me burn Kirkley-Hall with fire, and all its nunnery."

"Nay, good comrade," answered Robin Hood gently, "I cannot grant such a boon. The dear Christ bade us forgive all our enemies. Moreover, you know I never hurt woman in all my life; nor man when in woman's company."

He closed his eyes and fell back, so that his friend thought him dying. The great tears fell from the giant's eyes and wet his master's hand. Robin slowly rallied and seized his comrade's outstretched arm.

"Lift me up, good Little John," he said brokenly, "I want to smell the air from the good greenwood once again. Give me my good yew bow—here—here—and fix a broad arrow upon the string. Out yonder—among the oaks— where this arrow shall fall—let them dig my grave."

And with one last mighty effort he sped his shaft out of the open window, straight and true, as in the days of old, till it struck the largest oak of them all and dropped in the shadow of the trees. Then he fell back upon the sobbing breast of his devoted friend.

"Tis the last!"" he murmured, "tell the brave hearts to lay me there with the green sod under my head and feet. And—let them lay—my bent bow at my side, for it has made sweet music in mine ears."

He rested a moment, and Little John scarce knew that he was alive. But on a sudden Robin's eye brightened, and he seemed to think himself back once more with the band in the open forest glade. He struggled to rise.

"Ha! 'tis a fine stag, Will! And Allan, thou never didst thrum the harp more sweetly. How the light blazes! And Marian!—'tis my Marian —come at last!"

So died the body of Robin Hood; but his spirit lives on through the centuries in the deathless ballads which are sung of him, and in the hearts of men who love freedom and chivalry.

They buried him where his last arrow had fallen, and they set up a stone to mark the spot. And on the stone were graven these words:

"Here underneath his little stone  
Lies Robert, Earl of Huntingdon;  
Never archer as he so good,  
And people called him Robin Hood.  
Such outlaws as he and his men  
Will England never see again."
