# The Pepperpot and St Catherine's Down

1. __Heritage site__

*The Pepperpot* / St Catherine's Down

2. __Site context__

The Pepperpot is a well-known local landmark, but what tales are still extant about it? What tales are still extant about the things you can still, or could once, see from the top of St. Catherine's Down? *(I have maybe half a dozen things I am aware of but would like to research more)*

Two suggested source categories:

- "community" sources: local storytellers; local amenity users (e.g. regular walkers); local and Island residents; visitors.

- historical sources: particularly: local newspaper archives (or online via [British Newspaper Archive](https://britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk)), historical travel guides (e.g. 18th and 19th c. works in Castle Museum archive),  historical local tourist guides / pamphlets

3. __Community research  process / community prompts__

- do folk know the story behind the Pepperpot?
- what historical / legendary / mythological stories do folk believe / know / have heard about the Pepperpot?
- do folk know other tales associated with or visible from the location?
- do folk have their own personal stories about the location?

*What [historical / legendary / mythological] [stories / tales] [do you know / have you heard about] [the Pepperpot / the "new lighthouse" / the beach / the bay / other views from the top of St. Catherine's down]?*

If so, *In what context did such tales come to you?*

4. __Archive research__

- British Newspaper Archive (online)
- Castle Museum library / archive
- County Archive, Newport
- town libraries
- ?IWCP / Observer, other Island newspaper, physical archive copies?
- ?Quarr Abbey Library
- ?private libraries in local manor houses etc?
- ?local publishers?
- ?local booksellers?

I would also like to create an online PDF readable version of Island related books, particularly books that are also held in the Castle Museum (so folk can view them online, *or* actually go and see a physical version).

5. __Site specific event__

A performance event with several tales told about the Pepperpot and illustrative of views from the top of St. Catherine's Down.

Possible formats:

- storytelling event from a single location at the top of the hill;
- story walk up the hill, e.g. starting and finishing at the Wight Mouse Inn (toilets, car park, presumably bus stop, refreshments).

6. __Digital legacy__

? Audio capture / soundscape from development activity (community focus group, *ad hoc* interviews at or near the location, audio capture in the archive between two or more researchers "finding" things)

? Audio capture / soundscape around performance event

? Recording of walk up the hill relating some of the tales; breathy; low-fi.

? Commentary over a slow 360 video panorama

? Video record of illuminated / silhouette / shadow puppet performance, projected onto Pepperpot (TG?)

? Timelapse of light / weather over the bay, esp. as a storm comes in; intermixed with soundscape?

7. __Contribution to final project capstone public performance event__

? One or more stories to live performance (e.g. an Island Storytellers set at Ventnor Fringe)

? Guided car tour (online route round the sites, with annotations?)

8. __Physical legacy, merch etc.__

- site photograph on postcard, tea towel etc..
- story card (perhaps illustrated on one side?)
- branded pepperpots?!;-)
- custom designed, customised or overprinted physical maps
- guided work (with tales) pamphlet

9. __Costings__

It wasn't clear the extent to which we were supposed to be volunteering as much in as possible and just paying for capacity /resilience building interventions from external parties (e.g. training), or going fully costed. If we fully cost even to not then bid to cover those costs, it makes it clear what sort of in-kind / opportunity cost contributions / sacrifices are being asked for.

Also need to be mindful this is a Heritage Fund, not an Arts Council bid, although possibly opportunities for securing additional funding for more ambitious joint funded projects?

*Project management:*

- community engagement: (N days project management at £250 pd; room/refreshments booking, advertising / promotion related activity, participant recruitment)
- performance event (3 days project management at £250 pd; site booking, advertising / promnotion related activity, volunteer recruitment)

*Training:* community engagement training (£??); specialist support from archivist (£??)

*Archive visits:* photography licenses / digital scan / photocopying costs; travel / parking; British Newspaper Archive (per seat: £15 pm, £100 pa)

*Community event:* room hire, refreshments, paper / pens / flip chart / post-it notes etc. £??; marketing (posters/fliers £??; physical ads (IWCP, Observer etc) £??; digital media (onthewight etc); digital ads (Facebook, Google ads etc) £??); photographer / videographer / sound recordist £??. Transcribing costs (£??; there are lots of tools that do pretty good transcription, but you still needd to listen through and correct errors; this is "work", and should be paid for at min. wge at least...; *we do not want machine made up words, names etc, entering any legacy transcript*).

*Landscape capture*: photographer / videographer (£?? e.g. stills, panorama, timelapse, drone footage); sound recordist (soundscape); phsycial storgae (e.g. USB memory sticks £??); online storage (Flickr etc. £??)

*Travel:* site visits (n? x site visits, car (£?? per mile, £?? parking) or public transport (£??))

*Research materials*: books, pamphlets e.g. for an Island Storytellers physical library / collection ("resilience"); see also *Archive visits*

*Minimal site specific performance event:* marketing (posters/fliers £??; physical ads (IWCP, Observer etc) £??; digital media (onthewight etc); digital ads (Facebook, Google ads etc) £??); photographer / videographer / sound recordist £?? [it's too easy for those involved to not grab photos because they are busy doing other things...]

*Elaborate site specific performance event:* as minimal with mutliplier; creative development costs (£1k+ to artist?); event delivery costs (FX costs £500?)

*Possible joint event with archive(s):* marketing (posters/fliers £??; physical ads (IWCP, Observer etc) £??; digital media (onthewight etc); digital ads (Facebook, Google ads etc) £??); exhibit costs (£??)

*Digital design / development:* `interactive map` (? £250-500 as a project wide development cost ? ); `PDF viewer` (? £250-500 as a project wide development cost ?)

*Digital legacy:* domain + hosting (£75 per year as a project wide development cost ? ); advertising (£??)

*Evaluation:* professional evaluation (contribution to professional evaluation for whole project £??)

*Contribution to final capstone performance event:* e.g. Island Storytellers show at Ventnor Fringe (£100 sign on, marketing costs etc.)

And then, of course, the big question of whether it's biddable for or not: *personal time engaged: in-research / on-project (e.g. community engagement/workshops) / in-performance*.

*Future resilience*: £?? to support bid-writing for follow-on projects.
