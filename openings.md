"There once was a place, I don't know where, I don't know when.

"Once upon a time, and a very good time it was, though it wasn't in my time, nor in your time, nor any one else's time,"

Jon Mason - with invitation, along the lines of:

Come one, come all,  
Come big, come __small__,
Come short, come __tall__,
Come listen to my story...

Cf, carol "Come One And All, Come Great And Small", c.1885

Also:

Come boy, come __girl__



Once, which is to say always, which is to say never, ..

There once was a time, not your time, nor my time, nor anybody else's time, when ...

And if I'd never seen it happen like that, I' woul'd never have been able to tell you about it.

And I was there, and I can tell you that the feasting was like no other, and though I had to leave early, it's probably going on still

"Then I'll tell you what I'll do," said the smith. "I'll fix your sword for you if you tell me a story while I'm doing it..." Irish storyteller, 1935

In literary collections, and the criticism they have provoked, framing becomes either a genre or "a narrative mechanism for the linkage of possibly unrelated tales" (Belcher, 1). In oral performance, framing is one device among many.

"If it's a lie, it's not my fault, the person who told it me was the liar."

"They went by the ford, and I went by the stepping stones. They were drowned, and I came safe" (O'Sullivan 79)

"I left them there I came back here. I don't know what happened to them after that"

when swallows built their nests in old men’s beards, &c.

Once upon a time when pigs spoke rhyme,
And monkeys chewed tobacco,
And hens took snuff to make them tough,
