Ventnor Fringe 2024 Stories'n'Harp

Might be interesting to try to look for tells of these in the video?

Pedlar Swaffham:

- forgot to have the butcher/shopkeeper mention treasure under the tree in the first instance; recovered.

- - wasn't solid on when the verses were at the end, despite my "set/crib list"; need to better trust them; may be useful to do a full run through of stories, at least in form of all cues, all sung part, pickup after sung part. The prompts on my list were also in incorrect order: Twa sisters, then Pedlar (i.e. wrong way round); this was NOT HELPFUL!

Orpheo:

- messed up Orpheo asking "what news?" and being told that the steward had reuled well?

- forgot to have Orpheo set piece, while in disguise, "If I had been your King, Sir Orfeo; if I had gone into the wilderness"

Twa sisters:

- the miller sequence felt a bit flustered; I don't think I set up going to the gig on way out properly? Maybe need to play with some different ins-and-outs on that with music etc?

- felt like I was continually looking to my crib sheet on this, wioth some very long "stuck" pauses; got especially flustered in the wedding; I need to properly get that sequence visualised so I can look round it better.

England's Dreaming:

- could have done the set-up around the daughter and into song better. I think I used the chair earlier at Babushka? Messed up going through possibly roles for who the daughter would marry; i think that could be quite a playful bit and change each time/get differently ridiculous, but needs some solid checkmarks (shoemaker; sailor). I need to listen to or read through the song in proper preparation so I can set that up better.
