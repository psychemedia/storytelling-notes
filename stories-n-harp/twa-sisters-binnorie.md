# Twa Sisters / Binnorie

__`[OPENS WITH JENNI SOLO]`__

*There were two sisters sat in a bour;*  
  *Binnorie, O Binnorie*  
*There came a knight to be their wooer.*  
  *By the bonny mill-dams of Binnorie.*

The two sisters were the daughters of a rich merchant, a Lord, you might say, you might even call him, "a king", such were the times.

And when their brother, Hugh, came how with the handsome Sir William in tow...

...

As the younger sister, was carried downstream, the elder sister made her way back home, alone, explaining that her sister had spurned Sir William and run off with another.

Some little while later, downstream, a miller's daughter, dressed simply, calls to her father.

Body dragged ashore. Fine dress, fine rings on her fingers, a fine necklace round her neck. But no sign of where she had come from, or who she might be.

A passing harper saw the dead, bedraggled body, lying there in its ivory white dress, was taken by her beauty, and vowed to make a song for her. But he had business to attend to, a gig to get to that night, and he hastened on his way.

Some while later, the harper passed that way again. Noted the miller's daughter dressed rather more finely than she had been before, noticed the rings on her fingers, the glint of __a fine necklace against her breast.__

`(JC extra verse)`  
*Her body lay for twenty days*  
  *Binnorie, O Binnorie*  
*Scoured clean by summer and time.*  
  *By the bonny mill-dams of Binnorie.*

As he made his way along the path, a snag of white material caught in a hawthorn bush, an animal run, a scrape, and a small pile of disturbed bones, covered by what looked like long human hair.

Being a resourceful man, he... he reached out for the bones, a breast bone, and fashioned a small harp, a novelty piecel and strung it with the hair.

And continued on his way — for he was playing that night at a wedding feast, the daugher of a rich local merchant, a lord, you might call him, or even a king, such were the times.

When he arrived at the venue, he set the small harp he had fashioned earlier to one side, and then set to entertain with guests with his usual instrument.

__`TUNE(S)`__

Everyone was there - [brief description, including wedding party] —

After his set, the harper sat to one side, accepted the food that was offered to him, refreshed himself with a drink, perhaps...

But then, what was that?

__`HARP INTRO`__

The small bone harp, it seemed as if it was starting to play itself?

__`MORE ON HARP`__

It seemed as is if was trying to find its own voice?

__`EVEN MORE ON HARP`__

It seemed as if it were trying to speak, or to sing, or to, __to tell out its own story...__

*"O yonder sits my father, the king,*  
*Binnorie, O Binnorie;*  
*And yonder sits my mother, the queen;*  
*By the bonny mill-dams o' Binnorie.*

*"And yonder stands my brother Hugh,*  
*Binnorie, O Binnorie;*  
*And by him, my William, false and true;*  
*By the bonny mill-dams o’ Binnorie."*

*"And there sits my sister who drowned me.*  
*By the bonny mill-dams o' Binnorie."*

__`[LOUD CLAP / MUSIC STOPS]`__

There was an almighty CRACK, and the bone harp shattered into pieces.

And everyone looked, in horror, from the shattered bones...

...to the parents of the bride...

...to the stunned, staring eyes of Sir William...

...and to the elder sister.

And that is the end of the story.
