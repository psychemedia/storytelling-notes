THE CUNNING MAN AND THE DONKEY.—It will hardly be credited that in this enlightened age such an amount of ignorance prevails In our immediate neighbourhood as the facts we are about to narrate will demonstrate. A fortnight ago, a man living about two miles from Mitcheldean lost a donkey, and after searching in vain for it, he heard of a certain cunning man, living over at "Covutzide" (Berry Hill, near Coleford), which all-potent personage, he was informed, could not only tell him of Noddy's whereabouts, but also restore the animal to his owner. The poor man, thinking this was just the thing he wanted, was simple enough, after working for many a weary hour in the pit, to wend his way over to the residence of this "mighty oracle," a distance of about six miles, and, having been admitted into his august presence, "stated his case." After a most solemn pause, such as was consistent with the dignity of his "profession", the oracle replied that he could tell who had the donkey! The poor man's face brightened up at this intelligence, doubtless anticipating a speedy re-union with his long-ear'd friend, who, having been the beloved companion of his youth, a sympathetic relationship had grown up between them, and we may say, in the words of the "poet," in his inimitable parody on "old dog Tray,"

"They were more like brothers than we care for to say."

But alas for all human hopes! our friend soon discovered that the cunning man must have been speaking in the *past* and not the *present* tense, for If he knew who (once) had the donkey, he did not vouchsafe on this occasion to say *who had got it now*. That information must be deferred to a future visit. So after drawing a fee (simple) of 2s. from the hard earnings of his "client," he dismissed him with the following directions:— "Go home at once! Get a piece of white goner, four inches sqare, prick it with a pin all over so thickly as not to allow another hole being made in it; hang it up by the side of the fire-place, and by no means allow a child to touch it, for if you do, *all will be useless*. Let it remain three days, meanwhile throw salt in the fire at intervals during the time, and at three days end, come again." Strange to say, these injunctions were carried out to the letter. On the second visit, the cunning man exclaimed, "Your donkey is at this moment in the hands of some gipsies; they are proceeding towards Gloucester: "tallygraph" at once for the police to stop them; if they get over the bridge, I can do no more for you, as the water will be between us. The poor man demurred, stating he had no money nor means to "tallygraph," but he had a pair of good legs, and he would start off in pursuit. This he actually did, after "feeing" his profound "adviser," but we need hardly say his journey was fruitless. No donkey did he see — unless indeed a mirror was presented to him. Footsore and dispirited, he returned to his house, and on the following day, while walking in the immediate vicinity of his own residence, he came upon his donkey dead in a ditch. And this circumstance can be clearly and easily explained. The poor animal had been turned out to graze in the forest with its legs closely fettered. It had either lain down or fallen in the ditch, but was not able to rise, owing to the fetters, and there died. When found, it appeared to have been dead some days. We have had these statements from a most respectable person, who is fully acquainted with the case, and can vouch for its veracity.

MITCHELDEAN

The Cunning Man Again

One would hardly credit, in this (so-called) enlightened age, the amount of ignorance and superstition that still exists even in our own immediate neighbourhood; but the following ludicrous story has been sent us, the truth of which can be vouched for. A man residing near Mitcheldean got into debt at the shop of Mrs. Barnard, of the Bridge, Shapidge, and failing to pay up, Mrs. B. entered the case in the County Court, at Newnham. As the day for trial drew nigh, the debtor became anxious, and, after turning over many plans in his head to get out of it, he hit on the bright idea of taking a walk over to "Covut Zide" to the cunning man, and getting him to bewitch Mrs. B., so as to prevent her attendance at court on the court day. Arrived there, the noted wizard took the case in hand, gave him some stuff like birdlime (only dirtier in colour) and told his silly dupe to make all speed back to Mrs. B.'s, and if he could not prevail on her to take the stuff, he was to buy a pennyworth of brimstone from her shop, and, holding the two ingredients in his hand, he was to breathe on Mrs. B. This, he said, would have the effect of keeping her at home on the court day. This tale, we suppose, the stupid man believed, for in an incredibly short space of time, he arrived in Mrs. B.'s garden, a distance of nine miles, almost breathless and exhausted. The speed at which he had travelled, may be best gathered from his own words, viz., "I a nevr vund o' my vit all along the road till I lit clean plump in these very gardin." We must therefore suppose that his cunning friend lent him a pair of wings, and that he came the "way the crow flies." What a splendid mark for a sportsman! Our riflemen might have had a shy at him if they had been out that evening, supposing him to be a "great pelican of the wilderness"; but now, how does our hero succeed with his nostrum? Why, when he "lit" in the garden, he "lit" upon Mr. B. instead of Mrs. B.; whereupon he requested the favour of Mr. B.'s partaking of a little of the cunning man's mixture. Mr. B. shook his head, smiled, and said, "It looks too much like mouldy cow-dung for me." But the man replied with all seriousness, "You are bewitched, and this will cure you." However, it was "no go," and meeting with the same ill luck in his brimstone experiment on Mrs. B., he went his way. On court day, Mrs. B. also went her way, and that was to Newnham, where she obtained judgment from his Honour for the debt and costs; and from what we hear,

Mrs. B. has a hearty good laugh  
When she thinks of this wonderful trick;  
But she's not to be taken by chaff,  
And the cunning man's birdlime *won't stick*.

Had simpleton paid off the debt  
Long stack in his creditor's "gizzard,"  
He'd have saved him a thorough good sweat,  
Which he got running after the wizard.

The Cunning Man Again

To the Editor of the Ross Gazette.

Dear Sir,— When I was a boy I used to hear of certain apples called "Tewkesbury wheedles," but I never until a few days ago beard of Tewkesbury simpletons. Would it be believed that on Saturday morning last two young men called on me to inquire the way to Coleford, stating they bad that morning walked from Pendock, near Tewkesbury, through pouring rain, having been informed that near Coleford there lived a "cunning man," who could tell them who stole their tools? They were drainers, and had put several tools— shovel, pick, foot iron, &c.—at the door of a public-house while they had a pint of beer, during which time the tools were stolen. I told them my opinion of the foolishness of their expedition, when they determined to make the best of their way home again, when they would have walked about 40 miles on their fool's errand.

The Cunning Man of the Forest of Dean

TO DO - CHECK GENERATED BY CHATGPT

A short time since, three persons residing a short distance from Blakeney, in the Forest of Dean, turned out a horse each to graze. Finding but a short crop of grass, the animals strayed. On the owners missing them, a consultation took place, and it was resolved to seek the assistance of "the cunning man," who resides near, with the view of obtaining possession of the truant steeds. A fee of 1s. 6d. each soon set the man of stars plunging into the mysteries of his craft; and after various portentous consultations with this and that planet, and the casting up of mysterious problems, the sage, with the greatest solemnity, assured his confiding dupes that their horses had been stolen; that they had already passed through two market towns, and were then being driven through Iron Acton, and that "men and women" were concerned in the robbery. Thus enlightened, the horse-hunters, in high glee, left their "cunning" friend; and resolving to lose no time, at once crossed the Severn, and calling at a police station, requested some of the guardians of persons and property to accompany them in a chase after the thieves. The police, however, on ascertaining the source of their information, prudently declined the invitation. Nothing daunted, the intelligent trio, after a few maledictions on the blue-coats, proceeded to Acton, where "confirmation strong" of the oracle of the Forest was soon forthcoming, for lo, a number of gipsies had been seen to pass through the town with some horses! Certain they were the "men and women" who had possession of their horseflesh, the gallant hunters confided further chase to the police, telling them they had thence traced their lost horses, carefully avoiding, however, all allusion to a "cunning man" being their informant. The gipsies were traced by the police through Bristol, and some distance beyond, but no stolen horses could be found in their possession. The horse-hunters duly returned home, doubtless filled with admiration at the skill of the "cunning man;" but alas for his infallibility, one of the animals had, in the interim, strayed back near to its original place, where it was found quietly browsing, and the others were in a day or two discovered straying by the police, one at Breadstone Farm, and the other at Monmouth. We understand this same "cunning man" is much consulted by the poorer classes of the locality, but probably his reputation will be somewhat damaged by this occurrence.

HEREFORDSHIRE SESSIONS. (Concluded from our last.) Tuesday, Oct. 16. Elizabeth Hudson pleaded guilty to the charge of breaking open a drawer in the house of her master Mr. Samuel Howells, of Leintwardine, and stealing a sovereign she was sentenced to fourteen days' solitary confinement The Chairman blamed the prosecutor for leaving a large sum of money (between 30 and sovereigns) in his drawer, instead of placing the cash in bank, and thus removing temptation from the servants. —[A fact evincing the grossest credulity and superstition, was connected with the above case. Some time before the trial was to come on, the mother of the prisoner posted off on a long journey into Shropshire for the purpose of consulting cunning man" as to the best means of getting her daughter over the difficulty. The fellow for sum of money supplied her with old silk sash, which he dignified with the name of a magic band," and stated that if the prisoner wore at the trial, she would be sure to be acquitted ! The band was conveyed to the solicitor for the defence, who wished to cut it up and ascertain the contents, but the mother declined the proposal with the utmost horror, observing that destruction would come upon them all if this were done, and took it away with her. Whether the sash was worn or not, did not transpire, but its magic virtues were not put to tbe test, for the girl, following the sensible advice of her counsel, pleaded guilty as above stated.] James Bason, found guilty upon two indictments, the first for stealing hat, and the second for stealing a pair of spurs, was sentenced to seven days' solitary confinement for tbe first offence, and seven years' transportation for the second.

SUPERSTITION IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY.—WITCHCRAFT. A woman named Builth, wife a mason residing in the parish of Walford, was summoned by Mary Whitaker, the same place, to show cause why she should not be bound over keep tbe peace. Mr. Williams appeared for defendant.—Complainant deposed : On the loth inst. she and her sister-in-law were going to a well for water ; defendant was in her court, and had child in her arms, when she remarked tbere comes old poison-cat;" this remark hurt the feelings complainant so much, that she went into a neighbour's houst and sat down ; when she came out again, defendant made the same remark, which caused complainant to go into fit, and remain for hours insensible ; complainant said the defendant was witch, and defendant had said she could make anybody walk their heads up a hill. Cross-examined : Did not call defendant a witch, nor accuse her of bewitching her pig ; believed defendant was a witch ; defendant had said she could use the black stick.—The Chairman enquired what that was Mr. Williams replied that it was the wand in which was the supposed magic power. The Chairman wished to know if Mr. Wiliiams had it in Court; tbat gentleman denied that his client was witch, saying that she was not in possession anything of the kind.—Complainant's examination continued : Her husband did not go into the Forest of Dean to consult a witch-finder, neither had she a charm round her neck ; admitted that she was not always amiable, and might have peppered the defendant little ; did not say that the wise man in the Forest would make defendant dance within a circle. Jane Hughes corroborated the foregoing evidence. She said the defendant was reputed witch ; had heard her say she could make people walk their heads ; she had told witness that she (the defendant) stuck her black stick in the garden, that witness could not enter it : she could bring all Kovvle Hill and Bull's Hill (places in tbe parish), to prove that defendant had said that she could bewitch people.—Cross-examined : Had never seen defendant fly through the air on a broomstick ; defendant was in the habit of wandering about the road at all hours of the night.—The Chairman said she had a perfect right to do so if she had liking for it, and wished to know if that was the reason she was looked upon witch Witness said defendant was very quarrelsome* and that nobody in the hill liked her.—Defendant denied the power imputed to her; she said her neighbours wished to make appear that she was witch, and were consequently afraid of her ; a great many persons were wearing trinkets they had got from the "cunning man in the Forest, to act as charms against her witchcraft ; she had lent complainant 15s. to buy pig, and because the pig would not eat, they said she had bewitched it, and went to the "cunning man" for him find out whether it was the cause or not ; the pig would not eat, therefore it was killed and eaten as pork. Mr. Williams, in addressing the Bench on behalf defendant, said that the information could not be sustained ; defendant had made no threats or used any bodily violence ; her making use of the poison-cat," was not sufficient upon which to call upon the defendant for sureties ; if complainant had any her mind, it arose from her own imagination that defendant had some supernatural power ; a number women were living in the same neighbourhood—they quarrel, and run for justice ; in short time they become reconciled, and live on friendly terms again ; he contended that there was case made out; it was case of defamation of character, and such a charge was be established as precedent, there would be no end such charges brought before their worships. Captain Power replied : In tbat case there would more clients for Mr. W. The witnesses had proved that defendant had commenced the quarrel. Mr. Williams said he should be able to prove that such was not the case ; and called the defendant's two daughters (two good-looking girls), saying those were the defendant's charms. Mr. Whatley thought they appeared like "Lancashir witches." The Bench length advised the parties to coinp ro mise the matter, by each paying their own costs. Mr. Williams asked tlie Bench to pronounce th*" defendant was not witch. The Chairman said, course, the Bench did not co»" sider that she was a witch ; and, addressing the parti*? 8 gave them some good advice, and recommended them *° live together as friends and neighbours should do. . Thus ended this strange tale of witchcraft, created much amusement to a crowded Court.

WITCHCRAFT AT Ross.— A woman named Builth, residing near Ross, has been charged before the magistrates with annoying another woman named Margaret Whitaker. The complainant had been called an "old poison cat," and a witch, and defendant had said she could make anybody walk on their heads up a hill. Jane Hughes deposed that t athe defendant was a repuited witch. Had heard her say that she could make poople walk on their heads. She had told witness that if she (the defendant) stuck her black stick in the garden, that witness could not enter it. She could bring all Kowle Hill `[Howle Hill?]` and Bull's Hill (places in the parish) to prove that defendant had said that she could bewitch people. Cross-examined: Had never seen defendant fly through the alr on a broomstick. Defendant was in the habit of wandering about the road at all hours of the night. Defendant denied the power imputed to her. She said her neighbours wished to make it appear that she was a witch, and were consequently afraid of her. A great many persons were wearing trinkets they had got from the "cunning man" in the Forest of Dean to act as charms againsther witchcraft. She had lent complainant 15s. to buy a pig, and because the pig would not eat, they said she had bewitched it, and went to the "cunning man" for him to find out whether it was the case or not. The pig would not eat, and therefore it was killed and eaten as pork. The solicitor for the complainant asked the Bench to pronounce that she was not a witch. The Chairman said of course the Bench did not consider that she was a witch, and the parties were then dismissed.
