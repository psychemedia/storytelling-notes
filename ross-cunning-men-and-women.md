THE CUNNING MAN AND THE DONKEY.—It will hardly be credited that in this enlightened age such an amount of ignorance prevails In our immediate neighbourhood as the facts we are about to narrate will demonstrate. A fortnight ago, a man living about two miles from Mitcheldean lost a donkey, and after searching in vain for it, he heard of a certain cunning man, living over at "Covutzide" (Berry Hill, near Coleford), which all-potent personage, he was informed, could not only tell him of Noddy's whereabouts, but also restore the animal to his owner. The poor man, thinking this was just the thing he wanted, was simple enough, after working for many a weary hour in the pit, to wend his way over to the residence of this "mighty oracle," a distance of about six miles, and, having been admitted into his august presence, "stated his case." After a most solemn pause, such as was consistent with the dignity of his "profession", the oracle replied that he could tell who had the donkey! The poor man's face brightened up at this intelligence, doubtless anticipating a speedy re-union with his long-ear'd friend, who, having been the beloved companion of his youth, a sympathetic relationship had grown up between them, and we may say, in the words of the "poet," in his inimitable parody on "old dog Tray,"

"They were more like brothers than we care for to say."

But alas for all human hopes! our friend soon discovered that the cunning man must have been speaking in the *past* and not the *present* tense, for If he knew who (once) had the donkey, he did not vouchsafe on this occasion to say *who had got it now*. That information must be deferred to a future visit. So after drawing a fee (simple) of 2s. from the hard earnings of his "client," he dismissed him with the following directions:— "Go home at once! Get a piece of white goner, four inches sqare, prick it with a pin all over so thickly as not to allow another hole being made in it; hang it up by the side of the fire-place, and by no means allow a child to touch it, for if you do, *all will be useless*. Let it remain three days, meanwhile throw salt in the fire at intervals during the time, and at three days end, come again." Strange to say, these injunctions were carried out to the letter. On the second visit, the cunning man exclaimed, "Your donkey is at this moment in the hands of some gipsies; they are proceeding towards Gloucester: "tallygraph" at once for the police to stop them; if they get over the bridge, I can do no more for you, as the water will be between us. The poor man demurred, stating he had no money nor means to "tallygraph," but he had a pair of good legs, and he would start off in pursuit. This he actually did, after "feeing" his profound "adviser," but we need hardly say his journey was fruitless. No donkey did he see — unless indeed a mirror was presented to him. Footsore and dispirited, he returned to his house, and on the following day, while walking in the immediate vicinity of his own residence, he came upon his donkey dead in a ditch. And this circumstance can be clearly and easily explained. The poor animal had been turned out to graze in the forest with its legs closely fettered. It had either lain down or fallen in the ditch, but was not able to rise, owing to the fetters, and there died. When found, it appeared to have been dead some days. We have had these statements from a most respectable person, who is fully acquainted with the case, and can vouch for its veracity.

MITCHELDEAN

The Cunning Man Again

One would hardly credit, in this (so-called) enlightened age, the amount of ignorance and superstition that still exists even in our own immediate neighbourhood; but the following ludicrous story has been sent us, the truth of which can be vouched for. A man residing near Mitcheldean got into debt at the shop of Mrs. Barnard, of the Bridge, Shapidge, and failing to pay up, Mrs. B. entered the case in the County Court, at Newnham. As the day for trial drew nigh, the debtor became anxious, and, after turning over many plans in his head to get out of it, he hit on the bright idea of taking a walk over to "Covut Zide" to the cunning man, and getting him to bewitch Mrs. B., so as to prevent her attendance at court on the court day. Arrived there, the noted wizard took the case in hand, gave him some stuff like birdlime (only dirtier in colour) and told his silly dupe to make all speed back to Mrs. B.'s, and if he could not prevail on her to take the stuff, he was to buy a pennyworth of brimstone from her shop, and, holding the two ingredients in his hand, he was to breathe on Mrs. B. This, he said, would have the effect of keeping her at home on the court day. This tale, we suppose, the stupid man believed, for in an incredibly short space of time, he arrived in Mrs. B.'s garden, a distance of nine miles, almost breathless and exhausted. The speed at which he had travelled, may be best gathered from his own words, viz., "I a nevr vund o' my vit all along the road till I lit clean plump in these very gardin." We must therefore suppose that his cunning friend lent him a pair of wings, and that he came the "way the crow flies." What a splendid mark for a sportsman! Our riflemen might have had a shy at him if they had been out that evening, supposing him to be a "great pelican of the wilderness"; but now, how does our hero succeed with his nostrum? Why, when he "lit" in the garden, he "lit" upon Mr. B. instead of Mrs. B.; whereupon he requested the favour of Mr. B.'s partaking of a little of the cunning man's mixture. Mr. B. shook his head, smiled, and said, "It looks too much like mouldy cow-dung for me." But the man replied with all seriousness, "You are bewitched, and this will cure you." However, it was "no go," and meeting with the same ill luck in his brimstone experiment on Mrs. B., he went his way. On court day, Mrs. B. also went her way, and that was to Newnham, where she obtained judgment from his Honour for the debt and costs; and from what we hear,

Mrs. B. has a hearty good laugh  
When she thinks of this wonderful trick;  
But she's not to be taken by chaff,  
And the cunning man's birdlime *won't stick*.

Had simpleton paid off the debt  
Long stack in his creditor's "gizzard,"  
He'd have saved him a thorough good sweat,  
Which he got running after the wizard.

The Cunning Man Again

To the Editor of the Ross Gazette.

Dear Sir,— When I was a boy I used to hear of certain apples called "Tewkesbury wheedles," but I never until a few days ago beard of Tewkesbury simpletons. Would it be believed that on Saturday morning last two young men called on me to inquire the way to Coleford, stating they bad that morning walked from Pendock, near Tewkesbury, through pouring rain, having been informed that near Coleford there lived a "cunning man," who could tell them who stole their tools? They were drainers, and had put several tools— shovel, pick, foot iron, &c.—at the door of a public-house while they had a pint of beer, during which time the tools were stolen. I told them my opinion of the foolishness of their expedition, when they determined to make the best of their way home again, when they would have walked about 40 miles on their fool's errand.

The Cunning Man of the Forest of Dean

TO DO - CHECK GENERATED BY CHATGPT

A short time since, three persons residing a short distance from Blakeney, in the Forest of Dean, turned out a horse each to graze. Finding but a short crop of grass, the animals strayed. On the owners missing them, a consultation took place, and it was resolved to seek the assistance of "the cunning man," who resides near, with the view of obtaining possession of the truant steeds. A fee of 1s. 6d. each soon set the man of stars plunging into the mysteries of his craft; and after various portentous consultations with this and that planet, and the casting up of mysterious problems, the sage, with the greatest solemnity, assured his confiding dupes that their horses had been stolen; that they had already passed through two market towns, and were then being driven through Iron Acton, and that "men and women" were concerned in the robbery. Thus enlightened, the horse-hunters, in high glee, left their "cunning" friend; and resolving to lose no time, at once crossed the Severn, and calling at a police station, requested some of the guardians of persons and property to accompany them in a chase after the thieves. The police, however, on ascertaining the source of their information, prudently declined the invitation. Nothing daunted, the intelligent trio, after a few maledictions on the blue-coats, proceeded to Acton, where "confirmation strong" of the oracle of the Forest was soon forthcoming, for lo, a number of gipsies had been seen to pass through the town with some horses! Certain they were the "men and women" who had possession of their horseflesh, the gallant hunters confided further chase to the police, telling them they had thence traced their lost horses, carefully avoiding, however, all allusion to a "cunning man" being their informant. The gipsies were traced by the police through Bristol, and some distance beyond, but no stolen horses could be found in their possession. The horse-hunters duly returned home, doubtless filled with admiration at the skill of the "cunning man;" but alas for his infallibility, one of the animals had, in the interim, strayed back near to its original place, where it was found quietly browsing, and the others were in a day or two discovered straying by the police, one at Breadstone Farm, and the other at Monmouth. We understand this same "cunning man" is much consulted by the poorer classes of the locality, but probably his reputation will be somewhat damaged by this occurrence.

The Cunning Man of the Forest.—A short time since, three persons, residing a short distance from Blakeney, turned out a horse each to graze upon the unenclosed part of tho Forest, a privilege enjoyed by persons residing in tho neighbourhood.

HEREFORDSHIRE SESSIONS. (Concluded from our last.) Tuesday, Oct. 16. Elizabeth Hudson pleaded guilty to the charge of breaking open a drawer in the house of her master Mr. Samuel Howells, of Leintwardine, and stealing a sovereign she was sentenced to fourteen days' solitary confinement The Chairman blamed the prosecutor for leaving a large sum of money (between 30 and sovereigns) in his drawer, instead of placing the cash in bank, and thus removing temptation from the servants. —[A fact evincing the grossest credulity and superstition, was connected with the above case. Some time before the trial was to come on, the mother of the prisoner posted off on a long journey into Shropshire for the purpose of consulting cunning man" as to the best means of getting her daughter over the difficulty. The fellow for sum of money supplied her with old silk sash, which he dignified with the name of a magic band," and stated that if the prisoner wore at the trial, she would be sure to be acquitted! The band was conveyed to the solicitor for the defence, who wished to cut it up and ascertain the contents, but the mother declined the proposal with the utmost horror, observing that destruction would come upon them all if this were done, and took it away with her. Whether the sash was worn or not, did not transpire, but its magic virtues were not put to tbe test, for the girl, following the sensible advice of her counsel, pleaded guilty as above stated.] James Bason, found guilty upon two indictments, the first for stealing hat, and the second for stealing a pair of spurs, was sentenced to seven days' solitary confinement for tbe first offence, and seven years' transportation for the second.

SUPERSTITION IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY.—WITCHCRAFT. A woman named Builth, wife a mason residing in the parish of Walford, was summoned by Mary Whitaker, the same place, to show cause why she should not be bound over keep tbe peace. Mr. Williams appeared for defendant.—Complainant deposed: On the loth inst. she and her sister-in-law were going to a well for water; defendant was in her court, and had child in her arms, when she remarked tbere comes old poison-cat;" this remark hurt the feelings complainant so much, that she went into a neighbour's houst and sat down; when she came out again, defendant made the same remark, which caused complainant to go into fit, and remain for hours insensible; complainant said the defendant was witch, and defendant had said she could make anybody walk their heads up a hill. Cross-examined: Did not call defendant a witch, nor accuse her of bewitching her pig; believed defendant was a witch; defendant had said she could use the black stick.—The Chairman enquired what that was Mr. Williams replied that it was the wand in which was the supposed magic power. The Chairman wished to know if Mr. Wiliiams had it in Court; tbat gentleman denied that his client was witch, saying that she was not in possession anything of the kind.—Complainant's examination continued: Her husband did not go into the Forest of Dean to consult a witch-finder, neither had she a charm round her neck; admitted that she was not always amiable, and might have peppered the defendant little; did not say that the wise man in the Forest would make defendant dance within a circle. Jane Hughes corroborated the foregoing evidence. She said the defendant was reputed witch; had heard her say she could make people walk their heads; she had told witness that she (the defendant) stuck her black stick in the garden, that witness could not enter it: she could bring all Kovvle Hill and Bull's Hill (places in tbe parish), to prove that defendant had said that she could bewitch people.—Cross-examined: Had never seen defendant fly through the air on a broomstick; defendant was in the habit of wandering about the road at all hours of the night.—The Chairman said she had a perfect right to do so if she had liking for it, and wished to know if that was the reason she was looked upon witch Witness said defendant was very quarrelsome* and that nobody in the hill liked her.—Defendant denied the power imputed to her; she said her neighbours wished to make appear that she was witch, and were consequently afraid of her; a great many persons were wearing trinkets they had got from the "cunning man in the Forest, to act as charms against her witchcraft; she had lent complainant 15s. to buy pig, and because the pig would not eat, they said she had bewitched it, and went to the "cunning man" for him find out whether it was the cause or not; the pig would not eat, therefore it was killed and eaten as pork. Mr. Williams, in addressing the Bench on behalf defendant, said that the information could not be sustained; defendant had made no threats or used any bodily violence; her making use of the poison-cat," was not sufficient upon which to call upon the defendant for sureties; if complainant had any her mind, it arose from her own imagination that defendant had some supernatural power; a number women were living in the same neighbourhood—they quarrel, and run for justice; in short time they become reconciled, and live on friendly terms again; he contended that there was case made out; it was case of defamation of character, and such a charge was be established as precedent, there would be no end such charges brought before their worships. Captain Power replied: In tbat case there would more clients for Mr. W. The witnesses had proved that defendant had commenced the quarrel. Mr. Williams said he should be able to prove that such was not the case; and called the defendant's two daughters (two good-looking girls), saying those were the defendant's charms. Mr. Whatley thought they appeared like "Lancashir witches." The Bench length advised the parties to coinp ro mise the matter, by each paying their own costs. Mr. Williams asked tlie Bench to pronounce th*" defendant was not witch. The Chairman said, course, the Bench did not co»" sider that she was a witch; and, addressing the parti*? 8 gave them some good advice, and recommended them *° live together as friends and neighbours should do. . Thus ended this strange tale of witchcraft, created much amusement to a crowded Court.

WITCHCRAFT AT Ross.— A woman named Builth, residing near Ross, has been charged before the magistrates with annoying another woman named Margaret Whitaker. The complainant had been called an "old poison cat," and a witch, and defendant had said she could make anybody walk on their heads up a hill. Jane Hughes deposed that t athe defendant was a repuited witch. Had heard her say that she could make poople walk on their heads. She had told witness that if she (the defendant) stuck her black stick in the garden, that witness could not enter it. She could bring all Kowle Hill `[Howle Hill?]` and Bull's Hill (places in the parish) to prove that defendant had said that she could bewitch people. Cross-examined: Had never seen defendant fly through the alr on a broomstick. Defendant was in the habit of wandering about the road at all hours of the night. Defendant denied the power imputed to her. She said her neighbours wished to make it appear that she was a witch, and were consequently afraid of her. A great many persons were wearing trinkets they had got from the "cunning man" in the Forest of Dean to act as charms againsther witchcraft. She had lent complainant 15s. to buy a pig, and because the pig would not eat, they said she had bewitched it, and went to the "cunning man" for him to find out whether it was the case or not. The pig would not eat, and therefore it was killed and eaten as pork. The solicitor for the complainant asked the Bench to pronounce that she was not a witch. The Chairman said of course the Bench did not consider that she was a witch, and the parties were then dismissed.

A TALE OF OLD ROSS. THE WITCH OF BRAMPTON-STREET. [By B. B.]


The one sure way to old Jim Painter's heart was to listen well, and to show no sign of disbelief augured favourably f'r another good story at a future date. One  must admit that, as a rule, the old man WAR worth listening to. and what he didn't know about the old town—cell , never happened! "  In his °en words: " There ain't much as ha bin going on anywheres 'tweon Wilton Bridge and Wes'on Cross these last. fifty year as I don't know summat about!"  And I was a good listener! Old Jim told  me so himself. I could wish that my memore equalled my patience; but I fear that, as far as I am concerned, the best part o f'" Painter's histories and mysteries was buried  when they laid his old, worn-out body to restunder the ancient elms a decade or more ago. To see the old man of a summer evening heardstanding at his door, with his one hand resting shoulder-high on the doorpost, and the other continually combing his whiskers, in- I  dieated he was there for the pritoose of what be was p l ease d tr, denominate 1,, hit a a  dat;" mid to eross the road, oi in any other '  way attempt to avoid him, was to re l ogm ,oneself into his black books. her 1  One evening the ann going down a rosy red, tinting " mackerel ' sky, as I halted I 'urg er ' in front of old Painter's door to pass the time of day." "Good evening, Mr Painter. The sky looks pretty, doesn't it?" "Good e i ening. Aye! Look pretty enough, but we'm going to have a windy night. wou mark me! And I do hate a windy night. These or drums here." toeciue his head back to indicate that he spoke of the house he inhabited, "three ol' drums here be just like sr many sieves, they he. and the wind whistle through 'ern for all the world like a lot_ o'_ witches " Wiuthest" I laughed "Don't you laugh at witches." he said, looking at me very seriously. "I don't liks to bear folks sneer about 'em. 'cos—well, 1 do know what I do know. I supFose you don't believe nothing about witches, 'fo6 you aint seen none! Why do you know wa had on' in this very town! Old Betty Williams 'twas, and her lived up a top o' Branton Street—they used to call her the Witch o' Branton street. And her didn't mind it a bit; in fact. I knows her was proud o' being called it. I was very young then. and when I used to hear the tales shout her, what her could do, and how her used to change herself into animiles, I used to grin about it SaluO as you was doing just now." "Im sorry," I ventured apologetically, but the old man went on. . . . "I have heard as her was a dab-band at charming away warts and curing sore eyes and all them sort of things. She know'd a lot about herbs and was always a-hunting around for 'ern and a-cooking of 'em; and there's no doubt as she was very clever in her way Now, there was one thing in this world as her hated most particular. Her couldn't a-bide dogs—not any sort. 'Twas said as there was one dog as whenever he passed her at the door used to hark and snap at her, and her used to look at 'nu, and grind her tith together; and one day, as the dog was a-corning down the street, when he got to Betty. William's door there was a great. hig strange cat n-sitting on the doorstep. 0' course, the dog goes for the cat, hut the: do sav asshe jus gived 'tin one or two pelts with her paws, and away be went a-yowling down the street like mad, and he never corned near the old 'ooman's door agen. "But I don't really know nothing shout whether that tale was jonnuek or no. This I do know though, and if you haint in no hurry tell von. It was just dayhreak one morning, three or your on us bwors about town was a-going off up Branton Street. Dick Welyn was one on 'cm (hut yon don't recollect him), and he had got his whippit with' him. That was a pretty dog. a' no mistake, and him could catch anything as ever runned on four legs I do believe. Early as 'twas, Betty Williams was a-stood at her door. "'Where he you bwoys a-going this time o' the morning?' her says. "'We'm wing mushrooming up at Hilly Ayton.' says I. " What's tha want thic dog with the for then? He don't catch mushrooms, do he?' says the old 'ooman. "'No,' chimes in Dickie Welyn, but he's a dulled fine 'un a'ter a hare! °ain't yn like to give us a run, Betty? I do bear as you can turn yerself into a hare when you'd a-mind. I'll lay as my g bud give ya socks if he had ya in front on 'ne!' "Old Betty she looked that wild as you! don't know, and said as if he didn't clear off with his impidence heed limb both him and I his dog, and with that her slams her door. Dick laughed, and so did the rest on us, antl we stood a I•it. a-talking about what jolly fine fun it hod be if we was ever to come across old Betty whilst she was a hare! Well, a'ter standing there a minute or two we moves on, and was all a-sauntering. along, when just where you turns off for Cawdor Well, I'm classed if a hare didn't slip over the wall just iu front on us, and just as smartly leers back agen, and away' down evade she goes. We just forgot about the mushrooms and everything else, and away we goes a'ter the hare. If we hadn't been so exeitaxi, we should 'a noticed that there was muntnat very queer about this Cheer' hare. She doubled, she turned. she twisted, I and she just seemed to he a-playing peep-po with the dog all the time—at first anyway's. She reerningly Oirl't want t' get too far awns from us. Presently she made a clear run down to the old orchard by the One Mill. Then she starts her gar es again, all over the place till you'd thought she'd nearly run the whippit off his legs. Then, over the fame she slip 4. and cuts off round - by the One Mill. and for a hit it looked as if her had gone away up the Rope Walk. 'Stead of which shed lept the brook, and was a-going straight up the Stook meadow—a nice bit on the fiat, you know. "That was just where she went wrong, von see, for the whippit was at her heels in leas than no time, and the last thing we seed o' the hare was just afore you comes to the Brook's-month. Here, you know, the hroo's runs through deep. steep hanks; and Ns the' hare corned to the bank. we saw the dog nip' hold of her close to her sent, and over they both pitch-poled together out of sight. " W e eouel hear the dog a-yelping as if I he was being murdered. Up we rushed to the place where we'd seed 'em go over. and what d've think we saw? Why, there was Betty 'Williams a-standing in•the brook up to her knees in water, a-walloping the poor dog most ohmercifully with a branch as sh'd snatched off one o' them hushes there. " Where's the hare," I. says. "'What the deuce be you a-doing to my dog?' shouted Dick Welyn. " `lf you don't call this infernal mongre: off, screw his neck round,'" shrieked Betty; but the dog didn't want much calling off, for he'd stunk away from her, and was standing a-shivering and a-shaking on a hit of shelving bank there. The 'oonian, her starts a- scrambling up the opposite hank to us, muttering and cussing to herself, and when her'd got. up her turns round to us and shook her fist at m. and d--d the lot: Then she made to go off, but r'ooid hardly hobble along, and kept a-clutching at and a-holding of her hand on her hip. " 'Hallo, misais! What's the matter with yer hip?' calls out Diekie Welyn, in a alien , jug sort o' way. Betty just turned her head, and says: it's notating to speak of. I (witched ray foot in a scent-tump Onolehole). and twisted toy leg. if you wants to know.' 'Oh, aye! I expect so! Shouldn't wonder, amoral Dkk Welya. And I spose you was a-walkingabont in the bruk to mire it! No fear! . I knows, butties!' he shouted, excited-like to es. 'I know . I knows, . Betty!' and he runs down the bank opposite to alter sho was got to, and he shaves his -

'You Karl You owdacious liar!' screams the 'ooman, and I tell ya straight she was terrible to see. She used the most awful langwidge as ever I did hear, and said we should all be paid out; and she kept on like that till even Dick Welyn began to look pretty white in the face, and we all turned round quietly, and walked off t'other way  and left her.

"But, Mr. Painter, do yon really believe she was the hare?" I remarked. as my, old friend paused and ran his fingers though his beard.

"Why for not?" came his quick reply. "If sh weren't that hare, can you tell me how her corned to be aertending up at the Brook's Mouth when w e'd seed her hardly any time afore up top o' Branton -street And we runned all the way! No, my buoy. her couldn't a-done it on two lep. Dickie  was right. It was her. 'Sbles which, atweyr, walked lame on the one side a'ter.

Ross Gazette - Thursday 01 January 1914

DICK WELYN'S LOVE AFFAIRS. [Some time subsequent to the relating of the incident concerning "the Witch of Brampton-street," my old friend Jim Painter told me what he professed to be the sequel thereof. Jim had the reputation of "romancing," and as to whether the following really happened or was merely the figment of his rather lively imagination, I prefer to leave to the reader; but I have attempted to set it down, as near as memory will serve, in his own words.—B.B.]

Funny things do happen, even in our times. You'll mind me tellin' you one day about that they to-do we had with the Branton Street Witch, when Diek Welvn's dog chased her a'ter heed. turned herself into a hare. An° p'raps you fell a-wonderin' if her ever kept her word about having her revenge on 'un. Well, she did! An' the way she 'served 'un out INOIz to mix herself un with his love affairs—and Richard had more'n one, d can assure you but as to how many on 'em Betty Williams shoved her nose into I can't say. No more could Dick Welyn for that. matter. But somehow or other they seemed to be off afore they wuz on. so to speak, and the ROM wenches appeared to fight. shy on 'un. Not 'cause he warn't o decent enough sort o' chap, by no means, for a nicer bloke never stood up in shoe-leather, and as him and me were such pals I know'd most all his business. It vruz a'ter Dick had been walking out some little while along of a Jennie Greaves —one o' the maids she Was at the Bank (she warn't a Ross personl—it wuz a'ter he had been keeping company for a goodish while with her that Dick got a bit suspicious that then wrz somebody as wnz a-trying to upset his apple-cart along o' Jennie. 0' course, I had this straight from Dick's own lips, so you'll understand it bent any o' my making- 111). Jennie she began to cool off all of sod den. hut still she'd go for walks with 'im for the ways of maids he peculiar. At last Dick he made sip his mind as he'd know what wuz amiss. One night their ramble took 'em along the Rene Walk and they'd got to the old gate by the One Mill. Relf-way through the Pete Dick turned to the girl. "Now, look here. Jennie," says he. "T 1 wants to know what's wrong 'tween you and me. You knows T he very fond n' you—we 'a bin walking out together long enough for you to find that out surely—lint you seems very short with me lately. What have done, or what 'ant I done I'd like to know?" Jennie she wouldn't answer 'on fora minit or so, and Dick he inst stood ther holding the gate, while Jennie twiddled her ribbons through her fingers - till Dick felt mad n'most "Hadn't we heft& be going on?" asked Jennie at last. "No!" bursts out Dick, angrified. "We don't go from here till you tells me what's up." "I don't kno* as I be called on to tell you anything," say Jennie, a hit defiant. "I-be-going-to-know!" says Dick, slow and determined-like. "Well, then. Dick." says the girl, a'ter considering a bit, "Will you swear as ther be nothing 'tween you and any other maid in this town? Answer me that! Only. do tell the truth, for goodness' sake, for if I find yon out I'll never speak to you again!" "I'll answer you," replied Dick, " and jolly quirk, too, as my conscience is clear. Thor ain't nothing 'tween me and no other maid that breathes. Finger wet, finger dry! Thor, see!" and Dick wetted his finger and dried it on his cost, and drawed 'en cross his throat, like the youngsters do. " And I do believe you, Dickie dear," and Jennie she started to cry. "Come and sit down on the Mill steps, my girl," says Dick, putting his arm round her in a comforting way. "Ther's a bit more I'd like to find out whiles we be talking slant it," and with that they goes through the gateway and sits down on the Mill steps (Thee's three on 'em up to th° door, y'. know). "Now," says Richard, a'ter they'd settled theireelves on the stews, "I be very impatient to know who's bin trying to set you agin me!" "Oh! never mind all that now," says Jennie. "Nothing matter now I know you bent a.carrying on with somebody else and fooling me!" "Carryin' on!" and Dick laughed. "I like that! Me carrying on! Why, ther bent a Ross girl as'll go two steps along o' me anywhere. And I don't know why Not as I do want 'em nowadays, for since I've knew' l you. Jennie, ther bent room in this 'ere heart of mine for another female soul. " "You owdashus liar!" Dick an' .Tennie they jumped off them steps like one o'clock, and Jennie she gives a squeal, for the voice that shouted out them three words came from right behind 'em. They could see as the mill door wuz now partly open, hot it wuz too dark to make nut who twuz stood inside. Jennie she hang on to Dick's arm she trembled so. But Dick he faced round and sages out bravely enough: "Who he you, and what he you a-doing of in ther, a-sneaking and listening to what folks he a-talking about?" "Yon knows who I he well enough." came the voice, as though her wuz crying (for 'twus a female's voice right enough). "flanged if I do!" says Dick. "You knows well enough who I be, and why T be here. Bent I here to meet von? Didn't you ax me to? Only I s'pose with all the rest of your flames you've got 'em muddled up. and so von brings your latest wench round here a-filling her up with yer lies!" Dick he stood ther that dumb he couldn't get a word out for a hit, and Jennie she drops his arm and begins to edge off. Then Dick suddenly flares up. "I don't know who you he: I don't know. I say! And it's you as he telling the lies. Come out on it, and let's see yer evil face, whoever you be. Come out. I say, and be honest!" "Ohl aye! I daresav!" shouts back the voice, sneering-like: " Come out. So as your new girl can see my face and go and make me the laughing-stock of the town. No thank you, Mister Welyn; I stays where I be, as yon knows well enough who I he." Jennie starts sobbing and mumbling summat about it being right what she'd heard, &ter all. " What's say?" says Dick, turning quick on her. "nu wuz only amusing yerself along o' me a'ter all, and I be going home," and with that she begins to move off agen. Dick he catches hold of her arm and says he: " You listen here. Jennie °reeves. give you my solemn davy as I don't know who that he in them" and with t'other hand he pointed hack through the mill door. "You liar." came the voice again. "Don't You take no notice elf that. An' morel If you moves from here afore pulls that false wretch out of ther and proves meself I'll never speak to von agen—no, not if yer goes down on yer headed knees and axes me to. " "You run away home and leave me to my sweetheart," the voice cried, "for him is my sweetheart and ha' sworn so many a time." Dick he turns to Jennie and says: "Now, who he you s-going to believe, that'n in tlmr or me?" But poor Jennie she couldn't stand no more. and She just turned and rnnned up Tankard Street as hard as she could. Dick he stood and watched her till she'd disappeared round the corner; then he dashed up them steps, and through the door, and he shouts; "Now, you purty beauty, I be going to see who you be, and heaven help you when I lays hands on you!" He stood a turning his eyes this way and that whilst he wuz saying this, but nern a glimpse of anything or anybody moving could he get, though as ho finished speaking a soft, mocking sort of a laugh seemed to come from tither side of th' room. Then he thought seed summat move, and be makes a dash a it, and throwed his arms round it, only to find as he wuz clutching hold on to a big heap of empty sacks as come falling all over 'ho and smothering 'im with doubt. As he went sprawling ther came a reg'lar screech of laughter, and the mill door slammed to with a bang as made every hair on his head stand on end. Pp he Rot as well as he could, a-spitting and spluthering end trying to get the doubt out of his eyes and mouth, a. bumping hisself up agin the walls, and cussing like old Nick cos he couldn't find the door. When he did find 'nn, out he rushed and tried to listen for footsteps, but he counld'nt hear nothing. Then from the bridge close by came the words, " Pretty Dick!" followed by another of them loud mocking laughs. But 'twux a dark night, and afore Dick could cover the few yards from the mill to the bridge, them wuz naught to be seen. It fair upset poor Dick, and he came straight to my place. White as a sheet he wuz, and a hit shaky too, and when we had it all over he says: "Now, what d'ye make of it all, ,Lim? " "Well," says I, " what about Betty Williams? " my mind seeming to fly to 'her in a minit. Dick he sat a-considering and scratching his head, and then says slowly-like: " 'Tweren't a bit like her voice . . . no, not a hit . . . Yet it seems like her handwork . Aye . . perhaps so. But bow could her Yo it, and her lame?" Well, I can't pertend to explain how twos done. But ther wern't much doubt but what it wuz Betty Williams handwriting 111 over (and it was as it turned out a'ter—l'll tell you some day perhaps); •but as I say how her did it's a mystery to this day.

For real, undiluted tun, with a dash of excitement in it, A SMELLING COMPETITION will be found hard to beat. Offer a prize (a bottle of scent) to the moat successful competitor. Preparations for this competition must be made beforehand; but the little trouble will be amply repaid by the merriment which it will certainly cause. Fill twelve little muslin bags respectively with dried lavender, camphor, pepper, coffee, lea, cocoa, peppermint, tobacco, mustard, sage, nutmegs, cloves, or any other scented stuffs available. Tie up the tops of the bags and hang them by strings to a line stretched across the room. The guests are provided with a paper and pencil and told to write down, in order, the names of the contents of the bags. This must be found out by smelling the bags, no one being allowed to touch them with the fingers. Ins given time, say five minutes, the competitor who is found to be the most correct wins the prize.

The Witch of St B———— (Briavels?)
 TO DO

Sir,—With your permission I dedicate the following: first, to all young folks come home for the Christmas hollidayg; secondly, to all ardent admirers of tales of witchcraft; and, lastly, to all "snub-nosed boys, who shake well in their shoes" at a good story of ghosts and goblins.

But in a sieve, I'll thither sail,  
And, like a rat without a tail.  
I'll do ♦ * * "—Macbeth.

My great-grandfather used to tell the following tale to his grandchildren, when sitting round the fire on a winter's night; and by them it was heard with all the fright and curiosity which the young experience in listening to a tale of horror. There lived in the village of St. B———, about the middle of the eighteenth century, an old woman who was looked upon as a witch, and numberless were the tales that were told of her wicked deeds. If it chanced that a cow lost her milk earlier than usual. "Betty Bitcher, the old necromancer, had bewitched her;" if a mare cast her foal, and the poor old woman had been hobbling along to gather her burden of sticks anywhere near the field (if a week or a fortnight before the event,) still "it was her doings," and deep and dark were the anathemas launched against her; if the butter would not come in the course of churning, (which will happen to the best of dairymaids sometimes,) "old Betty was at her tricks again," and had bewitched the cream; and oftentimes was the poor old creature dragged out of her miserable abode to go and "bless the cream:" then, if the butter came, there was a positive proof of her bewitching powers; if it came not, the "devil was in her heart and had nullified the blessing!" Sometimes the old woman dared to face the whole parish by going to the monthly meeting of stately churchwardens, dignified overseers of the poor, and burly constables, to ask for a small advance upon her weekly pittance—decrepid with an incurable asthma, passed the revered age of "three score years and ten" and pressing hard towards her fourth score, she stood, before them.

TO DO  What rating, reviling, and scolding then took place: and any pecuni iry loss or misfortune had befallen one of the mighty men the conclave, majority might have carried the question to pop the old; lady the tire, and gently burn, or rather roast (as the expression was) the d—l out her;" however, as mygrandsire used laughingly to tell, the additional sixpence per week was generally added to her stipend, some voting it from pity, but it was strongly suspected that the party headed by the burly constable did it from little fear ot the poor old lady's power to come," and not wishing to have ricketty babies, or babes brought into the world with one eye in the forehead, and the mouth placed where the organ of sound should have teen. Betty was dismissed from the meeting with an exordium from the parson, churchwardens, and parish clerk, to home now and leave off her bud ways, to think of her end and eschew evil." Aye, aye," said the constable; that s right, gentlemen, hope she will chew ike devil, and bite him pretty hard too." Sometimes she would attempt to explain away her offences, and commencing in her usual style with Well, gentlemen, there's one above that knows"—but she never got any farther; for tiie thoughts poor Betty having anything to with, or say about One who looks with pity cn the shorn lamb" raised such tempest that she, lifting up her hands and making her short curtsey, was glad hear the vestry door slam loud behind her; for how could the clerk, the constable, the village schooltnastf-r listen to such things from such "an one?" Time went on and old Betty was drawing close to that bourne from whence no traveller returns: ' her eightieth birth-lay had l ing passed by, and still urchins, aye, and big lubberly clowns 100, ran fast by her cottage door after night-fall, fearing they knew not what, only knowing that everybody said "a witch lived there!" It was the year 17—, in the latter part of December, a clear frosty night, the moon shining brilliantly, but at times almost obscured clouds, which rising the high west, swept swift across the heavens, changing colours and objects for the moment, and then leaving all bright and clear again. My great grandsire, in brown coat, brown beeches to match, brown bob wig, not quite so brown as his coat, waistcoat, and nether garments, sat half dozing his fireside when he was aroused from his nap the sudden entiance of old bai ber-.surg. on Wortran, the last practitioner of that double calling in our village, a most useful man in those days. the plethoric parson alter eating six pounds "forest venison," with two large onions an incentive,an act professional which was called for the, fourth helping, with the second tankard strongale. (Ah! what constitutions those days compared to cur times, when two glass-s of light wine are almost too much for the gentleman with the cuffs turned up and the collar turned down, reversing nature and dress the same rime, and who has long since eschewed port too heavy for his nerves!) He extracted the raging, tooth of the red-faced country milkmaid, and that of the roaring lout, who said, cut qff yead if ye can t out! He also gave relief to the corns of the squire's laly, who, having pressed her toes into the sharpest point possible, was kept up to the position by pair of high hee.s, and which, probably, caused the introduction of minut's for who could have jumped very nimbly about with laose martyred, crampedup toes? So ih ladies and gentlemen moved minuet, gently or. their feet those instruments of torture would permit. The other ami great qualification of the barber-sergeou we must leave surmise, only it was reported was called Daddy Worgan by the village urctiins, who were taught believe brought them in from under gooseberry-bash. The barber-surgeon's haste admitted of no delay it was to beg the old gentleman would step down to the Mai: house, the locality of Betty Pitcher's wattle-aud-daub " residence, they would kill the old woman, as they were making hole in the ice to duck her in; caking fur his stick they started off together—two chivalrous kntghts-errant of seventyfive, thereabouts. When they reached the scene of action, there was old Betty, pmic-strickeo, in the middle of the one lubberly clown spitting in her face; another know if could veel; bat all bent some signal piece of for imagined evils; whilst three or lour country yok Is were deliberately preparing the chasm in which to duck the old witch. Soon the old old sticks (oak, of course, from the Forest of Dean) went to work, as wiilii gly and forcibly as seventy-live would let them; and, like ail sudden onslaughts,caused panic, and then followed narley, when forth stood the Saltun, "Salt-marsh.''—This soub.iquet was acquired from the number hogsheads of strong beer and rough Gloucestershire cider he swallowed, but still dry, dry, always dry! ami, iher for-, called Sah-tii by his super;ors, but the by his and boon companions. —He u,,enud the conference in the following sir,in:—"l'll tell 'er how 'tis, sir; ha' cotched her at last - e'eara.-, whistle, and I'li one sh ill duck it out her; and so come on my lads, now for a drop cold watar to cool her!" Another skirmish, and a closer approach the edge of the old ditch, (.t moat which ran round the castle, and continued to do until the last year, when scnilary regulations called for a removal of the nuisance ) within a lew foci of the yawning chasm waiting its prey. The fate poor, Betty and my grandsire's wig, with the effect which misfortune befalling the latter had on the fortunes the farmer must reman: till your next publication, as feel that my yarn has spun out much longer than I had intended. Wishing you, and yo ir readers, a merry Christmas, and a happy New Year, remain, &c.

The St. B——— witch concluded

{Concluded from our last.) the pricking of my thumbs, Something this way wicked comes. At the conclusion of my last paper, old Betty the witch was left in the hands her enemies, the scrimmage continuing with loud shouting of—" You shant"—"I will"—"She shall"—"She shan't be ducked," and so tho fury the fray continued. It is well known by all belligerents, that twenty to three are long odds in favour of the strong side, and so it appeared. Nearer, and nearer Still, the mighty host reached the hole made in the ice; and whether old Betty, grandsire, or barber-surgeon Worgan, was to take the first dip, or if, like t/te graces three, the plunge was to be simultaneous, appeared to doubtful; the oaken cudgels had changed sides, not from any disposition to rat, but were forced over to the other side by some powerful agency—perhaps expediency"— which has made many changes in our times. But, be that as it may, either from accident or design, the chances of war, off fell the hat and brown wig of one of the ancient heroes, fighting manfully for woman dear," and, rolling along the ice, parted company, when down went the wig into the abyss. Did yon ever see a wig pulled out of a pool of water? I have. Did you ever see very young hedgehog, when scared by a yelping puppy, roll itself up at the first bark? I have. And I know no two things that resemble each other more than a wig picked out of a pickle," and the hedgehog rolled up for defence; and where the aperture is to be found of either might pozzle a philosopher. Now, when the majority saw the hatless, wigless, head of the old gentleman, and heard the anathemas launched forth against their proceedings by barber-surgeon Worgan, they once more stood to their arms, with the arrant old witch trembling prisoner; and being fearful of carrying things too far; remembeiing, also, that day of reckoning might come, in more ways than one,they paused. After placing the loose handkerchief" over the bald head Berkleys" not having come into fashion then), with the fantail hat surmounting the same, a face rather flush'd with the exciretaent of the fray, perhaps with some little disgust at the fate of the bob-wig, aud the thoughts of his personal appearance at that moment, grandsire shouted out, the top uf his voice, "Let the old woman! - ' And, strange to say, old Betty found the iron manacles of the lawless released, and was not long in limping over to the minority. Seeing the vantage ground he had made, he continued, Shame on ye, shame ou ye ad, to serve the old woman in this mauner; what is all this foolery about? You, sir—and you, sir you ought at least to have known better. As for tnat drunken salt o.arKh, he deserves the cart-tail. There, Betty, go into your house: hnmble as it is, we will take care you shall have peace therein, or I will know the reason why," "God Al'rijhty bless you, sir, if yon had not come down lo my help, those wicked rascals wou'd hare been the death of rue; and now 1 can scarcely breathe, I am frightened; but thert one above My grandson saw dark and portent'ms clouds on swarthy brows, and advised the old woman to say nothing farther, but. into her dwelling. this time the brawl of tongues, not in harmonious sounds, brought many to the scene of action, and the minority, finding their strength the increase of numbers, assumed tne authoiita ive, and btrber-surgeon Worgan cried aloud for explanation. And now, young sit, or little miss, whichever may be reading tale, and anxious for the denouement, hero it comes, like the postscript of a letter, with all the news it. I'll tell you, gentlemen, all about it," says one of the party, making two steps forward, but not far from his own friends, knowing that two hours in the village stocks, which were within an easy distance of the battle field," would be neither easy nor comfortable ona. frosty night, in December, I'll tell you ail about it; there were eight or ten of us sliding on the ditch, and nice slide boys had made;"(aovv the spokesman was "Carrotty ■ Dick" from the churchyard-farm, the juvenile age twenty-two—stout, short-set, broad-shouldered, bigheaded, red hair like bristles, and such mouth—oh, yon may guess it Well," quoth Dick, the old 'un who is always in her tantrums whenever boys want to slide on ttie ditch, or play ball in the church-yard, or wickets on the Bailey-tump;"—all which spots of amusement were located near the old woman's cot; and seldom did the amusements close without some affront to old Betty, either by word or deed, hence the dislike of the poor old creature to rude, rollicking hobble-de-hoys; and hence the cruel treatment she received at their tender mercies. Go on, Dick, and finish your story. Well, as we were sliding so nicely, and I was trying to kick up Charley, for a lark; sneaking down the castle walls she comes, and runs light dash across the ice in the shape of great, big, black cat; ??e saw her: that's old Betty says one; that's she, cried another; and away we all started to catch her; but she was too knowing for us boys, and just as came to where her crossed the ice crack-crack—it went, and if we had slid three yards further, every boy of us would have gone slap into the ditch,"—and serve you right too" cries a voice, something like the tone of grandsire's. Carrotty Dick stopped short at this cutting interlude so deep tale; but this time the new-comers long, for the sequel* so they cried out, on Carolty Dick had drawn breath; he felt himself the hero of the tale; he had gained over the audience, and proceeded. Well, we watched her, and up the roof of the house she ran, and right down the chimney, there lost sight of her, didn't we, Charley Aye, that's all gospel truth," cried half score besides Charley. That's old Bettv at her devildoms again, we all said; now let us go right in and catch her; and the Salt'un coming by, we told him all about it, and the Salt'un says, come on, boys,' so we burst open the door, but the old 'un was too quick tor us, and had turned back into herself again but Lord, how she was panting for breath after being hunted so!" Deaf to all arpuneuls, nothing could convince them, that they had not seen and hunted old Betty Pitcher the witch, in the shape of a large black cat, and this was credited by some to the end of the eighteenth cen'tiry. The old gentleman had a knack of putting his hand up to his head once or twice whilst relating the tale, to see (it was suppnsre) if the old bob-wig was comfonably there and to sundry queries from his young audience, said, 4 suppose that some frightened cat ran across the ice, leaped up to the thatch of old Betty's low dwelling, and hid behind the chimney that the "boys' all rushing in a body to one apot, cracked'the ice by tbeir own weight; and that the size and colour of puss were created by their own fears ' "Ah, but the panting for breath!" said my father, credulously, with 1 knowing shake of the head. "Bill, you booby," said my grandaire, "you would pant too if you had an asthma of thirty years standing." "But how camo the cat such a big one? Old K'.ys, who was a boy at that tim«, says, that the cat was as large as sheep, and black as a coal; and that the boys met the next night, ami reckoned up evt-ry puss in the parish, and there was net one black oue out of the total of thirty eight. How came the cat such a big one?" That was because the boobies had told it so many times, 'till at last they believed it." "Ah!" said father, with a long drawn sigh, "I wish had been alive to have seen it, and caught her." "And if thou had'st," says the old gentleman, waxing warm, " I hope she would have given thee a good scratching!" the young ones laughed, partly at grandfather wit, and partly get rid of their own fears. But ere another year had coma round, old Betty had reached that bourne'' wihere all asthmas and reviltngs cease; and since the death of old Betty Pitcher, "old witches" have given way to younger ones and many a stalwart yeoman has been bewitched by the black and sparkling eyes of the young sorceresses our village. £. r.D.
