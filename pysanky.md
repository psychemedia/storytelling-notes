Pysanky


pyrsynker

From back before anyone could remember, the darkest, evilest monster had been chained to a rock, deep in cold, dark cave, high up in the mountains.

The monster would remain there on one condition: that each year, in the month before Easter, and only then, the women of the place would meditate for a day and then, in the evening, with the children in bed and men-folk sent elsewhere, they would make pyrsynker, beautiful eggs painted with intricate blessings, intricate designs. The egg itself represents the boundess universe and eternal life. Each colour, each sign, each shape wirtten on the egg has its own symbolic meaning. Dots represent the stars, the Gypsy roads, a neverending line separating two diffferently coloured areas represented a labyrinth that could trap evil spirits; yellow represented purity, the harvest, love and benevolence, orange was strength, blue, though rarely used, trust and the life giving air. Family tradition passes tdesigns through the generations, and each year, as the women get more skilled, the designs become ever more elaborate. And if the egg is broken, then bad luck will surely follow.

Each year, the monster would summon his demons and send them to corners of the world, checking, checking to see if the blessings were still being made. The more Pysanky [pyrsynker] were made, the tighter would be bound the chains. But if the blessings, weren't made, then the chains would be loosened and evil would be wrought on the world.

While we had Easter this weekend just gone by, in Eastern Europe, the Church follows the Orthodox calendar. And so if you see pictures this weekend of beautiful painted eggs amongst the wreckage and devastation, now you know a little of the story behind them.
