Dun Othail, North Tolsta.
It was a cold and snowy day when, under the guidance of the shepherd, by wading through overflowing brooks and wet heather, I reached the cliff above Dun Othail, which rose before me desolate and grand " through storm and reek," and at any time is one of the most picturesque objects in Lewis.
Dun Othail is a natural fortress, being an irregular peaked rock, upon the sea coast, nearly 200 feet high, and disjoined from the main by a perpendicular ravine which, however, does not reach to the water. The sides of the ravine appear to have been the walls of a trap-dyke, which has been denuded. The dun is only accessible from the land on the south-east side, and there it is defended by a wall. I was unable, through fatigue, to proceed beyond this, but the Rev. M. Macphail informs me that, although there is no defensive masonry upon the rock, it is bo diffi- cult of access that the path which leads upwards could be defended by a single individual

That is:—
At the North Laxdale river,
Where the great multitude of people will gather ;
# # #
But one shall come out of Dun O-ail That shall render them help and relief.
The deep ravine dividing Pun Othail from the main is called Leum Mhac Nicol, i.e., Nicholson's Leap ; and it is made to be the scene of a legend of which I have several and various editions. One of them may be briefly told as follows : — MacNicol, for some misconduct, was sentenced by the chief of Lewis to be mutilated. In revenge he ran away with the only child of the chief, and, being pursued, he leapt over the chasm to Dun Othail with the child in his arms. Persuasion was used to induce him to surrender the child ; but he refused unless the chief were reduced to the same condition as himself. Several subterfuges — which are too technical to be repeated here — were tried to deceive MacNicol, but in vain ; and to save the child the chief consented. When MacNicol was sure that he had gained his purpose, he sprang with the child over the cliff into the sea, saying (in Gaelic of course), "I shall have no heir, and he shall have no heir."
Now, this tale is a good instance that where the accidents of a place are fit, a legend is either originated there or is transferred to it The South Uist people claim the scene of this tragedy to have been at Huish- ness, South Uist ; and " Nicholson's Leap " is marked on Johnston's map. Nearly the same tale is told of a place in Mull, and probably elsewhere. But the original tragedy occurred a long way south of Lewis ; according to Gerald Barry it was " apud castellum Radulphi" at Chateau Roux, now the chief town in the department of the Indre, in France. The story is told in the " Itinerary through Wales," chap, xi, in words of the same meaning as those used by the bards of Lewis at the present day. It is most singular that an event which happened so far away, and probably more than seven centuries ago, should, though falsely located, be told in the islands with such distinctness. Whether it has been passed on from mouth to mouth, or whether it has been read from Giraldus by intelligent priests, it is nearly certain that it has been kept alive by repetition for at least three or four hundred years.1

 The custom of sending a child to be fostered in a family which had been at deadly feud with the parents of the child, although intended to strengthen in the strongest manner the truce between the families, often led to his destruction. We shall have another instance of fosterage in the murderer's family in the traditions of the Lewis Macaulays.

 The Four Torquils,
Soon after Cain Morrison was killed at Loch Broom, the Laird of Macleod himself died He had three [legitimate] sons, who were each named Torquil, viz., Torquil the Heir, Torquil Connonach, and Torquil Du ; he had also another son named Torquil Ogg. They all died before their father, and the cause of their deaths was as follows : —
Macleod the Laird was married four different times. The first wife died and left a son called Torquil the Heir. The second wife had a son whom his father also named Torquil, and his wicked mother bribed some mainland men to hang the heir at Ullapool, that her own son might succeed ; he was called Torquil Connonach. The second wife died ; the laird married a third time, and had a son named Torquil Du (who had a son named John), and his mother employed wicked hands to kill Torquil Connonach at Sandwick [by Stornoway].   The third wife died, and the TRADITIONS OP THE MORRISONS. 555
laird having married again, the fourth wife found means to have Torquil Du shot upon the moor by a couple of bloody men, named Mac Mhurchy, a branch of the Macphails or Mackenzies.
Macleod was now old and sickly, but coming to know that his wife had caused the murder of Torquil Du, he told his wife to send up their infant child, Torquil Ogg, or Young Torquil, that he might know by manual operation whether the child was fit to be his heir. The child was taken to his father's bed, when he handled the boy's body, and, in revenge of his mother's doings, he squeezed his sides together and so killed him. He then told his mother that the child would not stand the trial necessary to constitute him his heir, and that he was dead. And he added, " As you, bad woman, have left me without an heir, so I have left you without a son."   He then expired.1
There is no historic truth in this legend, but it shows to how late a period the power of the father over the fate of his child was supposed to exist. According to Dasent, among the pagan Northmen, " as soon as a child was born it was laid upon the bare ground ; and until the father came and looked at it, heard and saw that it was strong in lung and limb, lifted it in his arms, and handed it over to the women to be reared, its fate hung in the balance, and life or death depended on the sentence of its father." — Burnt Njal, vol i. p. xxv.

THE ITINERARY THROUGH, WALES DESCRIPTION OF WALES

p77-8
A circumstance happened in the castle of Haverford during our time, which ought not to be omitted. A famous robber was fettered and confined in one of its towers, and was often visited by three boys, the son of the earl of Clare, and two others, one of whom was son of the lord of the castle, and the other his grandson, sent thither for their education, and who applied to him for arrows, with which he used to supply them. One day, at the request of the children, the robber, being brought from his dungeon, took advantage of the absence of the gaoler, closed the door, and shut himself up with the boys. A great clamour instantly arose, as well from the boys within, as from the people without; nor did he cease, with an uplifted axe, to threaten the lives of the children, until indemnity and security were assured to htm jn the most ample manner. A gimflfly accident happened at Chateau-roux in France. The lord of the  place maintained in the castle a man whose eyes he had formerly put out, but who, by long habit, recollected the ways of the castle, and the steps leading to the towers. Seizing an opportunity of revenge, and meditat- ing the destruction of the youth, he fastened the inward doors of the castle, and took the only son and heir of the governor of the castle to the summit of a high tower, from whence he was seen with the utmost concern by the people beneath. The father of the boy hastened thither, and, struck with terror, attempted by every possible means to procure the ransom of his son, but received for answer, that this could not be effected, but by the same mutflation of those lower parts, which he had likewise inflicted on him. Hie father, having in vain entreated mercy, at length assented, and caused a violent blow to be struck on his body; and the people around Kirn cried out lamentably, as if he had suffered mutilation. The blind man asked him where he felt the greatest pain? when he replied in his reins, he declared it was false and prepared to precipitate the boy. A second blow was given, and the lord of the castle asserting that the greatest pains were at his heart, the blind man expressing his disbelief, again carried the boy to the summit of the tower. The third time, however, the father, to save his son, really mutilated himself; and when he exclaimed that the greatest pain was ?? his teeth; " It is true" said he, "as a man who has had experience should be believed, and thou hast in part revenged my injuries. I shall meet death with more satisfaction, and thou shalt neither beget any other son, nor receive comfort from this." Then, precipitating himself and the boy from the summit of the tower, their limbs were broken, and both instantly expired. The knight ordered a monastery to be built on the spot for the soul of the boy, which is still extant* and called De Doloribus.

LLEWELLYN AND HIS DOQ QELLERT, OR KILLHART.
TN hifl 'Curious Myths of the Middle Ages/ Mr -*■ Baring-Gould has conclusively shown that the tradition of Llewellyn and his faithful hound — so glibly related to credulous tourists in North Wales by the officious guides, who show, moreover, the very grave of the dog Grellert, or Killhart — ^has no more foundation in fact than the story of William TeU's shooting at an apple on his son's head.

170 POPULAR TALES AND FICTIONS.
The Knight and the Oreyhound,
There was a certain valiant knight which had only one son, the which he loved so much, that he ordained for his keepers three nourishers (t.e., nurses). The first should give him suck, and feed him ; the second should wash him, and keep him clean ; and the third should bring him to his sleep and rest. The knight had also a greyhound and a falcon, which he also loved right well. The greyhound was so good that he never run at any game, but he took it and held it till his master came. And if his master disposed him to go into any battel, if he should not speed therein, anone as he should mount upon his horse, the greyhound would take the horse-tail in his mouth, and draw backward, and would also howl and cry marvellouslie loud. By these signs, and the due observation thereof, the knight did always understand that his journey should have very ill success. The falcon was so gentle and hardy, that he was never cast off to his prey but he took it. The same knight had much pleasure in justing and tourney, so that upon a time under lus castle he proclaimed a tournament, to the which came many great lords and knights. The knight entered into the tourney, and his ladie went with her maidens to see it : and as they went out, after went the nour- ishers, and left the child lying alone there in the cradle in the hall, where the greyhound lay near the wall, and the hawk or falcon standing upon a perch. lu this hall there was a serpent lurking, or hid in a hole

to all of them in the castle unknown, the which when he perceived that they were all ahsent^he put his head out of the hole, and when he saw none hut the child lying in the ciadle, he went out of his hole towards the cradle, for to have slain the child.   The noUe blcon perceiving that, made sach a noise and rust- ling with her wings presently, that the greyhound awoke and rose up: and when he saw the serpent nigh the child, anone against him he leapt, and they both fought so long together, until that the serpent had grievously hurt and wounded the greyhound, that he bled so sore, that the earth about the cradle was all bloody.  The greyhound, when that he felt himself grievously hurt and wounded, starts fiercely upon the serpent, and fought so sore together, and so eagerly, that between them the cradle was  overcast with the child, the bottome upward  And because that the cradle had four pomels like feet falling towards the earth, they saved the child's Ufe and his visage from any hurt  What can be more exprest to make good the wonder in the preservation of the child ?  Incon- tinently thereafter, with great pain the greyhound over- came and slew the serpent, and laid him down again in his place and licked his wounds.  And anon after the justs and tumey was done, the nowrishers came first into the castle, and as they saw the cradle turned upside down upon the earth, compassed round about with blood, and that the greyhound was also bloody, they thought and said among themselves that the greyhound had slain the child, and were not so wise

as to turn up the cradle again with the child, for to have seen what was thereof befallen ; but they said, Let us run away, lest that our master should put or lay any blame upon us, and so slay us. As they were thus running away, they met the knight's wife, and she said unto them, Wherefore make ye this sorrow, and whither will ye run ? Then said they, 0 lady, wo and sorrow be to us, and to you. Why, said she, what is there happened ? show me. The greyhound, they said, that our lord and master loved so well, hath devoured and slain your son, and lyeth by the wall all full of blood. As the lady heard this she presently fell to the earth, and began to weep and cry piteously, and said, Alace, 0 my dear son, are ye slain and dead ? What shall I now do, that I have mine only son thus lost? Wherewithal came in the knight from the tourney, and beholding his lady thus crying and mak- ing sorrow, he demanded of her wherefore she made so great sorrow and lamentation. She answered him, 0 my lord, that greyhound that you have loved so much hath slain your only son, and lyeth by the wall, satiated with the blood of the child. The knight, very exceeding angry, went into the hall, and the grey- hound went to meet him, and did fawn upon him, as he was wont to do, and the knight drew out his sword, and with one stroke smote off the greyhound's head, and then went to the cradle where the child lay and found his son all whole, and by the cradle the serpent slain ; and then by diverse signs he perceived that the greyhound had killed the serpent for the defence of

the child. Then with great sorrow and weeping he tare his hair, and said, Wo be to me, that for the words of my wife I have slain my good and best greyhound, the which hath saved my child's life, aiid hath slain the serpent, therefore I will put myself to penance. And so he brake his sword in three pieces, and went towards the Holy Land, and abode all the days of his life.
