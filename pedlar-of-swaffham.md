The Pedlar of Swaffham

IN the old days when London Bridge was lined with shops from one end to the other, and salmon swam under the arches, there lived at Swaffham, in Norfolk, a poor pedlar. He'd much ado to make his living, trudging about with his pack at his back and his dog at his heels, and at the close of the day's labour was but too glad to sit down and sleep. Now it fell out that one night he dreamed a dream, and therein he saw the great bridge of London town, and it sounded in his ears that if he went there he should hear joyful news. He made little count of the dream, but on the following night it come back to him, and again on the third night.

, Then he said within himself, " I must needs try the issue of it," and so he trudged up to London town. Long was the way and right glad was he when he stood on the great bridge and saw the tall houses on right hand and left, and had glimpses of the water running and the ships sailing by. All day long he paced to and fro, but he heard nothing that might yield him comfort. And again on the morrow he stood and he gazed he paced afresh the length of London Bridge, but naught did he see and naught did he hear.

Now the third day being come as he still stood and gazed, a shopkeeper hard by spoke to him.

" Friend," said he, " I wonder much at your fruitless standing. Have you no wares to sell ? "

" No, indeed," quoth the pedlar.

" And you do not beg for alms."

" Not so long as I can keep myself."

" Then what, I pray thee, dost thou want here, and what may thy business be ? "

" Well, kind sir, to tell the truth, I dreamed that if I came hither, I should hear good news."

Right heartily did the shopkeeper laugh.

" Nay, thou must be a fool to take a journey on such a silly errand. I'll tell thee, poor silly country fellow, that I myself dream too o' nights, and that last night I dreamt myself to be in Swaffham, a place clean unknown to me, but in Norfolk if I mistake not, and methought I was in an orchard behind a pedlar's house, and in that orchard was a great oak tree. Then meseemed that if I digged I should find beneath that tree a great treasure. But think you I'm such a fool as to take on me a long and wearisome journey and all for a silly dream. No, my good fellow, learn wit from a wiser man than thyself. Get thee home, and mind thy business."

When the pedlar heard this he spoke no word, but was exceeding glad in himself, and returning home speedily, digged underneath the great oak-tree, and found a prodigious great treasure. He grew exceeding rich, but he did not forget his duty in the pride of his riches. For he built up again the church at Swaffham, and when he died they put a statue of him therein all in stone with his pack at his back and his dog at his heels. And there it stands to this day to witness if I lie.

LXIII. THE PEDLAR OF SWAFFHAM.

Source. Diary of Abraham de la Pryme (Surtees Soc.) under date loth Nov., 1699, but re-written by Mr. Nutt, who has retained the few characteristic seventeenth century touches of Pryme's dull and colourless narration. There is a somewhat fuller account in Blomfield's History of Norfolk, vi. 211-13, from Twysden's Reminiscences, ed. Hearne, p. 299. In this there is a double treasure ; the first in an iron pot with a Latin inscription, which the pedlar, whose name is John Chapman, does not understand. Inquiring its meaning from a learned friend, he is told

Under me doth lie

Another much richer than I.

He accordingly digs deeper and finds another pot of gold.

Parallels. Blomfield refers to Fungerus, Etymologicum LatinoGrcecttm, pp. ino-ii, where the same story is told of a peasant of Dort, in Holland, who was similarly directed to go to Kempen Bridge. Prof. E. B. Cowell, who gives the passage from Fungerus in a special paper on the subject in ti\t Journal of Philology, vi. 189-95, points out that the same story occurs in the Masnd-vi of the Persian port Jalaluddin, whoseyforwz/ is 1260 A.D. Here a young spendthrift of Bagdad is warned in a dream to repair to Cairo, with the usual result of being referred back.

Remarks. The artificial character of the incident is sufficient to prevent its having occurred in reality or to more than one inventive imagination. It must therefore have been brought to Europe from the East and adapted to local conditions at Dort and Swaffham Prof. Cowell suggests that it was possibly adapted at the latter place to account for the effigy of the pedlar and his dog.

THe PEDLAR OF SWAFFHAM.

I have tread in the June number of Fo/é-Zore the review by Mr. Andrew Lang of Mr. Gomme's recent book on Jo/Alore as an fisterical Saence, While it displays many of the piquant and delightful characteristics of Mr. Lang's writing I hardly think it does justice to the keen critical power, the wide knowledge, and the fertility of suggestion displayed in the work. On one point, however, I am heartily im agreement with the reviewer, namely, his opening remark that “discussion clears matters up, and that criticism is really a form of collaboration.” With this in mind I venture to offer a few observations on Mr. Gomme’s treatment of the tale of the Pedlar of Swaffham. It is a mere detail, and if the conclusion I am about to controvert be rejected the general argument of the book will be in no way affected. The utmost that can then be said is that some other story would have formed a better illustration of the possibilities which a due consideration of the contents of tradition may evolve.

All the British variants of the story of the Pedlar of Swafiham represent the hero to have been directed by his dream to London Bridge as the place where he was to hear good news. London Bridge is also mentioned in other traditions, English and Welsh, Moreover, it appears in a Breton story pot belonging to the Pedlar cycle, where the hero disputes with another man which was more beautiful, London Bridge or the grace of God. He bets all his possessions on the latter, and by the award of the first person they meet loses them. Then he makes his way to London Bridge to see it for himself, and there hears something which finally obtains him the hand of an emperor's daughter. A story in the ffeimskringla also mentions London Bridge. A cnpple directed to St. Olafs Church for healing meets on London Bridge a mysterious stranger who shews him the way to the church, Mr Gomme claims that these traditions prove that London Bridge, first built by the Romans, had produced a profound impression on the minds of the natives of Britain prior to the emigration to Brittany, as well as on the minds of the raiding Norsemen centuries later.

Taking the Norsemen first, it will be observed that the mention of the bridge is merely incidental, Toa man coming to London from France, as the tale represents, London Bridge would be the entrance to the city; and it is there (surely the most natural place) that he meets the Stranger who conducts him to the church. All the other stories to which Mr. Gomme refers were recorded centuries later than this, The earliest recorded version of the Pedlar of Swaffham is by Sir William Dugdale ina letter to Sir Roger Twysden under date zgth Jan., 1652-3. The Welsh tales (which do not belong to the same cycle, though they do relate to buried treasure) Were not recorded before the middle of the last century. The Breton story is later still,

Now with great submission I think this is rather a sandy foundation for Mr. Gomme’s conclusion, It may be conceded that London Bridge had acquired a reputation as a remarkable work, and one of the wonders of the capital, in all sorts of out of the way places. But it is far too large an assumption that it must have been before the flight of the Btitish emigrants at the time of the Anglo-Saxon invasion to their new home in Brittany. There was plenty of time and plenty of opportunity for much later tidings of the wonder to travel to remote places and become fixed in the mind of the folk before any of the tales were recorded, I am not tnmindful of the tenacity of tradition, mor do T forget that the date of the record is by no means the ferwinus a guo from which the date of the tradition itself is to be reckoned. The stories, however, are, in the form t least in which they have descended to us, all of them late. None of them, save perhaps the song “London Bridge is broken down,” could have arisen in a condition of society where hostility and bloodshed were rife, and travel and commerce were unknown or uncommon and unsafe. In a sense it is true that, as Mr, Gomme points out, legends of buried treasure belong to the period of conquest and fighting. But im this form they point to a period when the conquest and fighting had long been done, when peace had been re-<stablished m such prestige that people could safely trade and journey and if good luck attended them recover the treasure buried by others long ages before. There are still further considerations. The tale of the Pedlar of Swaffham is common all over central Europe as far north as Denmark and as far south as Sicily. It even appears in the Arabian Nights, the Masnavi J Ma'navé and other Onental compilations. The relations of these variants to ome another and to the British variants have mot yet been fully investigated. But it is quite clear that they all arose in much the same state of society; and it is important to mote that nearly all the European variants mention a bridge—sometimes one bndge, sometimes another, according to the country where the tale is told—as the place where the good news is to be communicated or the treasure heard of. Before we can draw any certain inferences from the mention m the Hritish tales of London Bridge, we must know why a bridge at all was selected as the scene. There is nothing of the sort in the, Oriental versions, and the remarkable agreement of the European tales on this detail points to a common source for them all. If, when the tale came’ to England, probably—nay, certainly—long after the Anglo-Saxon settlement, a bnidge had to be found as the scene, many reasons may be suggested for choosing London Bridge, without going back to the days of the Romans for its renown. The Lambeth window cannot upon the evidence be connected with the story. It did indeed agree with the stone figure at Swaffham in representing a pedlar with his pack and dog. But 80 far as local tradition goes, it was intended simply to commemorate a benefaction to the parish by a pedlar called Dog Smith. Dog Smith was an historical character who lived in he seventeenth century. It seems, however, that a painting | of a pedlar existed in the window long before his death, but whom or what it referred to there is nothing to show.! WNo tale corresponding to that of the Pedlar of Swaffham has been recovered in the parish. The dog, it should be observed, though found in the representations both at Swaffham and at Lambeth, does not make his apptatance in the story,

In view of these considerations I cannot think that Mr. Gomme is well advised in adducing the tale of the Pedlar of Swaffham as revealing anything of the stage of civilization of the native Britons when the Romans first built London Bridge, or of the impression made by the bridge upon their minds.
