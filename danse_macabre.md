After this period came into vogue a small lantern, built in the shape of a very narrow tower, like a hollow column, from twenty-six to forty feet high, the summit of which was surmounted by arcades, through which glimmered the faint light of a suspended lamp. This small building was called " the lantern of the dead " (Figs. 394 — 396) ; it was also termed a beacon (fanal), a lighthouse (phare), and a little tower (tourniele) . These beacon-towers, intended to indicate from afar during night-time the presence of a cemetery, generally had a door some- what above the ground, which was reached by a ladder or flight of steps.

Upon the side opposite to the door, an altar jutted out at the base of the tower. This altar was never consecrated, as the canons forbid any celebration to be held upon those which were in the open air (sub dio). There are many monuments of this kind in Maine, Berry, Angoumois, and Gas- cony ; they are all of Roman architecture, or of Gothic bordering upon

Dance of Death Holbein https://publicdomainreview.org/collection/hans-holbeins-dance-of-death-1523-5

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danse_Macabre
The Danse Macabre consists of the dead, or a personification of death, summoning representatives from all walks of life to dance along to the grave, typically with a pope, emperor, king, child, and laborer. The effect was both frivolous, and terrifying; beseeching its audience to react emotionally. It was produced as memento mori, to remind people of the fragility of their lives, and how vain were the glories of earthly life

May be possible to draw on this as a frame tale; eg Death having a conversation with each person as he picks them up, so rsomewone's tale that ends with death arriving.

Tallinn’s Dance of Death. Workshop of Lübeck master Bernt Notke. End of the 15th century. Art Museum of Estonia
A Dialogue in Low German between the Death and the Characters read by Sergo Vares.
The Dance of Death painting, located in St Anthony’s Chapel of St Nicholas’ Church, is the best-known and most valuable medieval artwork in Estonia. All that survives of the Tallinn Dance of Death is an initial fragment that is seven-and-a-half metres long. Originally, the painting is thought to have been almost 30 metres in length and included up to 50 figures. A preacher in the pulpit is introducing the dance, followed by Death playing the bagpipes and Death carrying a coffin. The first mortal is the Pope, followed by the Emperor, Empress, Cardinal, and King. A text in Low German comprised of a dialogue between Death and the characters is painted on a band below the figures.
The Tallinn Dance of Death in St Nicholas’ Church was first mentioned in 1603. In the mid-17th century at the latest, it was located in the chapel of St Anthony. The initial location and the commissioners of the work are unknown. The Dance of Death has been attributed to Bernt Notke, one of the best-known artists in northern Europe during the Late Middle Ages. In 1463, he painted a work on the same topic for St Mary’s Church in Lübeck (replaced with a copy in 1701, which was destroyed in 1942). The painting in Tallinn is the only surviving medieval Dance of Death in the world that is painted on canvas.
