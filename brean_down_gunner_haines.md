On the western edge of the Mendip Hills  
There stands a lonely peak,  
Surrounded on three sides by sea  
A peninisular so bleak.  

Sixty feet above the waves,  
Brean Down Fort now stands  
In 1864 was built,  
To guard the western lands  

With seven guns, the fort was armed,  
Each weighing seven tonnes,  
Manned day and night, by fifty men,  
Fathers, brothers, sons.

For nearly forty years it stood,  
No shot in action fired,  
But in nineteen hundred, July the sixth,  
5 a.m., it was retired.

*The blast was heard for miles around,*  
*The flames lit up the sky,*  
*No decent explanation found,*  
*Or fairly given why for why*

*Suicide or accident,*  
*It was tragic either way,*  
*The mystery of Brean Down Fort*  
*The tale..... of Gunner Haines.*

Now Gunner Haines was a normal lad,  
A soldier thirteen years,  
Described as conscientious, and  
Reliable, by his peers,

But he spent the night in Burnham.  
Maybe had a drink or two,  
But a flat tyre on his bike would mean  
He would miss the fort's curfew.

For this minor indiscretion,  
Haines was placed on charge,  
The punishment for lateness,  
Unlikely to be harsh

But its said this made him lose his mind,  
And want to lose his life,  
By blowing up the magazine,  
With the gunpowder inside.

*The blast was heard for miles around,*  
*The flames lit up the sky,*  
*No decent explanation found,*  
*Or fairly given why.*

*Suicide or accident,*  
*It was tragic either way,*  
*The mystery of Brean Down Fort*  
*The tale..... of Gunner Haines.*

Well the magazine ignited,  
In a single burst of flames,  
The blame for which lay firmly  
At the feet of Gunner Haines.

The explosion's only victim,  
Will never get day in court,  
So we'll never know what happened,  
That night at Brean Down Fort.

*The blast was heard for miles around,*  
*The flames lit up the sky,*  
*No decent explanation found,*  
*Or ever given why*

*Suicide or accident,*  
*It was tragic either way,*  
*The mystery of Brean Down Fort*  
*The tale..... of Gunner Haines.*

Disaster at Brean Down.  
EXPLOSION OF A MAGAZINE.  
A Gunner Killed.  
OTHER MEN REPORTED INJURED.

This morning about 5 o'clock a loud explosion occurred at Brean Down fort. At a later hour medical assistance was requisitioned from Weston-super-Mare, and it was reported that the magazine had exploded, killing one gunner and injuring others. There are only five men regularly stationed at the fort, the sergeant being the only married one. The Down is not very accessible from Weston, but fuller particulars are expected shortly.

EXPLOSION AT BREAN DOWN.  
A SOLDIER KILLED.  
THE FORT WRECKED.

TO DO

Yesterday morning, about five o'clock, the magazine at Brean Down Fort exploded, with the result that one soldier was killed and another severely injured. The contents of the magazine was estimated to include no less than 5000lbs. of powder in case, and considering the terrific force of the explosion-the greater portion of the fort being ' wrecked-it is astonishing that the whole garrison, some 17 men, were not killed.

Our Weston-super-Mare representative visited Brean Down soon after the explosion, and found that that portion of the down adjacent to the fort was simply covered with wreckage, huge coping stones, weighing upwards of 1 cwt., being found quite 200 yards from the scene of the disaster, whilst at intervals were scattered iron girders twisted into every conceivable shap, and the débris of the zinc powder cases were freely scattered around. Upon approaching nearer the fort a faint idea of the damage could be gleaned, the first intimation being the fact that the wall separating the fort from the moat in the south-west corner was demolished, and upon a nearer approach it was seen that with the force of the explosion a large number of the windows were damaged. Upon ascending to the top of the hill the interior of the fort could to some extent be seen. Here an awful scene of wreckage met the eye, and the only thought that passed through the mind was as to how so very few were injured. Two of the 7-in. guns were dismantled and lay amidst heaps of debris, the working portions being twisted and broken about almost beyond recognitIon, whilst masses of concrete and ironwork were scattered in all directions. Fortunately the only fatality is that to Gunner Haines-whose wife lives of 236, Bristol road, Bridgwater, and who has only been at the fort for the past week or so— although another gunner named Reed, who also has only been at the fort for a short time, received a dangerous wound, the artery in the left arm being cut by the falling debris. Other men were also more or less injured by a like cause, but their injuries are not such as to incapacitate them from duty. It seems that the deceased, accompanied by a comrade named Johnson, proceeded to Burnhama on Monday evening for the purpose of fetching home bicycles they had previously left there. At 8 40 both left Burnham for the fort, but on the way Haines had the misfortune to puncture the tyre of his bicycle. Johnson, after a time, left him and reached camp at ?? 10 40 some 40 minutes late, and at about midnight he let Haines, who was perfectly sober, into the fort. At about one o'clock Hamaes was seen in bed by one of his comrades and after this all seemed wrapped in mystery. At about five o'clock those in the fort and also those for miles around, were awakened by a tremendous explosion, the chaos being such that, to use the words of one of the men, "it appeared as if the end of the world had come." Upon investigation it was found that the magazine in the south-west portion of the fort had exploded, and further search revealed the fact that the deceased Haines was in the pit caused by the explosion. The deceased was quite unrecognisable, his head, legs, and one of his arms being entirely severed from the body and blown a considerable distance away; in fact, his head has not yet been found. His body, however, was identified by a ring he was wearing. The cause the explosion is at present more or less a mystery, but it is certain that Haines had no business where he was found. It Is stated that for some days past the deceased had been particularly quiet and morose.

MAGAZINE EXPLOSION AT BREAN DOWN.  
SOLDIER BLOWN TO ATOMS.  
GREATER PORTION OF FORT WRECKED

On Wednesday a profound sensation was created in Weston-super-Mare on its becoming known that the magazine at Brean Down Fort had exploded. SHortly after five o'clockm several townsfolk — principally resident on the beach— were awakened by a heavy report from the direction of the fort, but although the incident excited some curiosity, no suspicion was entertained of its possessing any sinister significance. Shortly after eight o'clock, however, the news arrived in town of a catastrophe, involving the destruction of a considerable portion of the fort and barracks, as well as the loss of one life, and sever injury in another instance. How the magazine was exploded appears to be a mystery, but rumour has not been slow to atribute the disaster to deliberate intent on the part of someone. That the list of injured should be limited to one killd and one injured appears to be little short of marvellous having regard to the terrible force of the explosion— for terrible it must indeed have been considering that the contents of the exploded magazine were estimated to include no less than 5,000lb. of powder in case. Had the whole garrison— whoch was temporarily augmented by the presence of a number o men intended to participate in heavy gun practice— been annihalated, once could not have been surprised.

Our Weston correspondent visited Brean Down during the morning, and found that that portion of the Down adjacent to the fort was simply covered with wreckage, ... `[continues as other example]`

Western Daily Press - Thursday 05 July 1900
That the magazine at Brean Down fort should have suddenly exploded at an early hour yesterday morning is an occurrence that demands the most thorough investigation. The mystery may be merely personal, but even so it is as well that the public mind should be speedily as possible disabused of any germ of suspicion that might have found lodgment there. It is alleged that the deceased had no business to be in the magazine all; and if this allegation be borne out by reference to the regulations it will be essential that some plausible reason should be advanced for his presence there. Moreover, the chain of circumstances leading up to the ignition of the ammunition will have to be made perfectly clear as a matter of public policy. In addition to the coroner's inquest, a Government inquiry will be held. The latter may probably be private, but through the medium of the coroner's court the public should be fully instructed in the details of the accident that is of interest far beyond the confines of Weston-super-Mare.

MAGAZINE EXPLOSION BREAN DOWN. ONE GUNNER KILLED, ANOTHER INJURED.

An inexplicable and serious explosion, which caused the death of a gunner and wrecked the fort, occurred at Brean Down at 5 a.m. yesterday. The officers in charge of the fort are naturally very reticent regarding the affair, but from inquiries on the spot it was ascertained that ordinarily there are four men on the Down in charge of Sergeant-Major Withers. A few days ago, however, the strength of the garrison was augmented by the arrival of about 14 men from the Flat and Steep Holmes for preliminary gun practice to fit them for their annual firing. Among these new arrivals were Gunner Haines — the soldier who was killed by the explosion — and Gunner Johnson, who left the Down on Tuesday soon after 5 o'clock and proceeded to Burnham to fetch their bicycles, which they left there on a previous visit. They left Burnham 8.30, but parted company on tho road in consequence of a mishap to Haines's machine, Johnson reaching the fort between 10 and 11. The deceased gunner reached his quarters close upon midnight, and both he and his comrade should have reported themselves by 10 p.m. Haines is said have been perfectly sober, and on his arrival at the fort went to bed and was seen by a comrade in the same room at 1 a.m. yesterday. Nothing unusual occarred until some four hours later, when the whole of those in the barracks were aroused by an alarming explosion, which shook the buildings. The report was heard at Cardiff, Weston, and Barnham. The whole of the garrison immediately turned out, and it was ascertained that the magazine in the south-wast corner of the fort had exploded. The absence of Gunner Haines was also noticed, and a search being instituted his body was found in a pit, caused by the explosion,  in the magazine. The wreckage caused by explosion was very considerable. Only one of the other men suffered any serious injury, and this was Gunner Reed, the artery of one of his arms being badly cut by some oe the falling *débris*. The force of ths explosion was visible some hundred yards before reaching the fort, huge stones, iron girders, and other wreckage being strewn about the Down. Inside the fort, however, the scene was remarkable. There are seven 7-inch guns in the fort, and the two in the south-west corner were thrown off their mountings, which were damaged beyond further servtce, and turned over. The barracks were much damaged, all the windows being broken and the roofs and walls shattered. Immediately after the explosion Sergt.-Major Withers proceeded to Weston, and notified Dr. Phelps of the affair. The doctor at once went to the Down, and the injured gunner was ordered to be brought to the Weston Hospital, where he was detained. The magazine was reported to have been duly locked and secured on Tuesday, and how the gunner who lost his life came to be where his body was found — or how he effected entrance into the magazine — are points that remain to be cleared up. The deceased was a soldier of some 13 years' service, and had a record for good service, albeit described as somewhat sullen. The magazine contained several thousand pounds of explosives. No civilian is allowed to inspect the fort, which was viewed at 12 o'clock yesterday morning Captain Wilkins. R.A., Lieut. Beardsley, R.A., aod Captain Paske, R.E., who came across by steam lannch from Cardiff. Gunner Haines was a married man, and his widow resides at 136, Bristol Road, Bridgwater.

THE MAGAZINE EXPLOSION BREAN DOWN.

INQUEST.

Dr. Craddock held an inquest at Borrow Hotel, yesterday, on Gunner Haines, who was killed in the explosion of a magazine at Brean Down fort on Wednesday.

Sergt. Bartlett, having stated that the deceased was 31 years of age, the following evidence taken :—

Sergt. James Withers said : I am a Sergeant in the Royal Artillery and stationed at Brean Down fort. William Haines was a gunner. I last saw him alive at 5 p.m. om the 3rd. inst. He was then in company with Gunner Johnstone going for a walk. He was perfectly sober at that time. On the following morning, about ten minutes to five o'clock, I heard a violent explosion. We went out to see what had happened and found that No. 3 cartridge store had exploded. We at once called the roll and found the deceased absent. The Master-Gunner called the roll. We inspected the store in company with Master-Gunner Brett, and there found the remains of a human being. The remains were in the centre of the floor of the cartridge store. The door of the magazine was locked at two pm., when witness was there. When witness next saw the door it was blown to pieces. There were nine or ten steps to get to the door. The only means of identification were by a ring which the deceased wore. A carbine was foond by Gunner Gibbs in the magazine yesterday morning. The Coroner: What means are adopted to prevent anyone getting into the store?—Witness: I don't see how anyone could get in. It is 10 or 12 feet underground, and is approached by two flights of steps. Between the two sets of steps there is the entrance door. The door is secured by brass lock. I have charge of the store, and it was reported to me as being locked at 2 p.m. on the 3rd inst. by Gunner Unsted, who is responsible for locking it. The magazine is opened daily, weather permitting, from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. Gunner Kehoe reported to the Master Gunner that his carbine was missing. I have since the remains of the carbine, it was bent, and the woodwork was gone, but the number was still to be seen. The Coroner: Hava you any duplicate keys to the magazine?— Witness: Yes, one to each door. The keys are kept in the office. Q.: Do you know if Gunner Unsted brought the key into the office? —A.: Yes, he handed it to me at two o'clock on the 3rd inst. Q.: How long had deceased been at Brean Down?—A.: He came there a week ago from Steep Holm. Q.- Has he been steady?—A.: Yes. Did he drink? —A: He had not drunk much, and the men told me he did not have much whilst on the Holmes. A Juror: Had he been stationed at the Down previously A.: Yes, about 12 months ago. Deceased should have returned to the fort at 10 p.m., on the 3rd inst., but he did not return until some hours later. A man staying out late without permission is put under arrest.

Gunner George Johnstone stated: I am a gunner in the Royal Artillery stationed at Brean Down. On the evening of the 3rd., about five o'clock, I went out with the deceased. We walked to the Commercial Hotel at Burnham. We did not return together. We left Burnham at twenty minutes to nine o'clock on bicycles. Gunner Haines's machine broke down about halfway between here and Burnham. I came to this house and had a glass of ale, and left hero at nine o'clock and proceeded to Brean, and I arrived at the fort at 10.40. The deceased did not arrive with me. He reached the fort an hour and a half afterwards. He had to walk. I let him in. He was apparently sober. We had three glasses of ale each whilst in Burnham. I was stationed with deceased five weeks on the Steep Holm. A day or two before deceased's death I noticed a change in his manner. He became very quiet, but he did not complain of being ill. When deceased went to Burnham he was in his usual state. To knowledge deceased had not been drinking hard lately, and I have not heard from anyone that he had. When deceased came home on Tuesday night he told me he had brought his bicycle and asked what time I arrived. Deceased seemed quite right then. I have seen the deceased's remains since the explosion. I identified deceased by a ring on the right hand. I also identified him by a truss he has always worn. On Wednesday morning, after the explosion, I saw all the deceased's clothing by his bedside, even his shirt.

A Juryman: Did you ever hear the deceased make use of any threat that he would do anything of this kind ?—No.

Do know if had any disturbance with anybody?—No.

John Prowse Shillabeer said: I am a bombardier at Brean Down. I remember the deceased going to bed at 12.45 on the morning of the explosion. I spoke to the deceased and asked him what time it was. He said he did not know exactly. I wished deceased "Good night," and went to bed. We slept opposite other. I heard the explosion, which woke me up. It must have been ten minutes to five o'clock. I noticed that the deceased was not then in his bed, and I also noticed that his clothes were in the room. I have only known deceased about a week, whilst at Brean. I have not during that time noticad anything strange about him.

The Coroner: During the week he was at Brean was there anything about him to lead you to suppose that he was not quite right in his head?— Not the slightest.

A Juror: Was the carbine taken from your room?—Yes.

William Charles Kehoe said: I am a gunner at Brean. Since the explosion—an hour afterwards— I missed my rifle. I identify the stock produced as belonging to my carbine. The number is attached to the stock.

A Juror: Was the rifle loaded when you left it? No, we have no ammunition in our possession.

Another Juror: Your rifle was more easy for him to get at ? Yes, it was near the door.

A Juror: Could the deceased get a cartridge?—I can't say.

Master Gunner Brett produced the barrel of the gun, which was very much bent, and stated that it showed that the gun had been fired.

Gunner Frederick Gibbs proved finding the barrel produced on Thursday morning about six feet from where the deceased's remains were discovered. The barrel was farther outside the magazine than the body. Witness added had known deceased since October, 1896, and the man, so far as he had known him, had always been quiet.

John Brett was next called. He said— I am master gunner, stationed temporarily at Brean Down. I am head of the establishment whilst there. have known the deceased almost three years. I have not noticed anything strange about him except that he had a violent temper. Deceased was on parade with me the day before the occurrence, and I didn't notice anything particular about him.

The Coroner—Can you account for his getting into this magazine store?—I can't; he had no business there whatever.

The Coroner— There is one point I want to ask yon. Can you account for a man being able to get hold of a ball cartridge? He could not in the fort of Brean Down. No man at the fort is served out with ammunition. It is all kept in the fort box, which is locked.

By a Juror: There was no loose powder in the magazine.

Sergeant Withers, recalled, stated that the ball cartrdiges were kept in the fort box in the office, and they were intact after the explosion. No ball cartridges had been served out. The witness stated that he could not tell whether the rifle was discharged unless the breech were opened.

A suggestion was adopted that the breach should be opened, and Sergeant Withers proceeded to a blacksmiths for purpose of doing so. On returning he produced a discharged cartridge, which was found in the breech, which satisfied him that the rifle had been fired.

The Coroner: Would it be possible for a person to fire down the ventilator and explode the magazine?— Weil, not unless the bullet struck the cylinders. There were no cylinders immediately underneath the ventilators. I examined deceased's clothing in company with P.S. Bartlett. All his clothes were in the room, so that deceased must have gone to the magazine in a naked state.

The jury returned the following verdict:— "Killed by No. 3 magazine Brean Down exploding, which explosion was caused by deceased firing a carbine loaded with ball cartridge down the shaft of the ventilator to the magazine whilst in a state of temporary insanity."

BREAN DOWN EXPLOSION.  
INQUEST AND VERDICT.  
Deceased Gunner Declared Insane.

The inquest on Haines, the gunner killed on Wednesday in the explosion at Brean Down, was held yesterday afternoon at Barrow before Dr. Craddock. One juryman insisted on viewing the fort, but the others objected. After the juryman had started to walk to the down—six miles distant—the other jurymen followed in a brake, and after riding several miles met the first juryman coming back. He told them that he had seen Captain Wilkins, who said a Government inquiry was being held, and the jury would put the officials to great inconvenience if they insisted on going over the fort. The jnry accordingly retired, and the Coroner said he hoped the persistent juryman was satisfied.

Sergeant Withers, stationed at the down, said that Haines's body was found in the centre of the cartridge store. The magazine door was locked at 2 on the previous afternoon, and after the explosion the keys were still hanging in the office. A carbine belonging to another gunner was found in the magazine. The carbine was bent and the woodwork gone, but the number was still visible. Duplicate keys of the magazine were kept in his office. Deceased was steady, and had been to the down previously. For staying out late men were put under arrest, and deceased would have been reported next morning. Witness could not say how deceased's body got inside the store. Witness added that his office could have been entered by a window and the keys could have been taken and returned.

Other witnesses showed that the explosion could only have been caused from ontside by firing a shot down the ventilator, and if deceased had been in the magazine at the time of the explosion no remains of him would have been found. The jury returned a verdict "That the explosion was caused by deceased firing a carbine down the ventilator, and that at the time he was temporarily insane."

POWDER MAGAZINE BLOWN UP.

Brean Down Fort, to the south of Weston-super-Mare Bay, was the scene of a serious explosion on Wednesday morning, a magazine containing 5,000 pounds of powder blowing up, killing one man and injuring several others. The southwestern portion of the fort was demolished, and two guns were dismantled. The cause of the explosion remains undexplained. It is stated, however, that Gunner Haines, who had seen 13 years service, had been to Burnham, and returned to the fort, at midnight retiring to his quarters. Just before five on Wednesday morning a loud detonation was heard, and Haines' body was subsequently found among the *débris* of the magazine. Surgeon-Colonel Phelps, of Weston-super-Mare, was promptly summoned, and found Gunner Reed with the arteries of one of his arms severed. He was removed to the hospital in the town. Others whose injuries were not so serious were attended to at the fort.

WORK FOR THE ARMY LEAGUE  
TO THE EDITOR OF THE MORNING POST.

Sir, — Permit me to call the attention of the above much needed and recently-established league to the serious explosion of a powder magazine containing 5,2751b. of powder in Brean Down Fort at the entrance of the Bristol Channel, the particulars of which became known on the 6th before a coroner's inquest on the body of the supposed incendiary soldier. "Keys of magazine kept in an accessible office, no sentry at night, and an accessible ventilator leading into the magazine direct," seems to have rendered possible what should have been impossible, viz., a wrecked fort. There seems also to be no resident commissioned officer R.A. to take charge of these three great forts, which bar the entrance or should bar the entrance of the Bristol Channel, so on the outbreak of war an officer R.A. will arrive who knows nothing of the locality, a stranger to the channels and tides and shipping, which he is supposed to protect— Yours, &c., F. A. CLOSE, Admiral. Bristol, July 10.

The Brean Down Disaster  
STATEMENTS HITHERTO UN-PUBLISHED

The explosion of a magazine on Brean Down, near Weston, a few days ago, which was attended with the loss of one life and the injury of another, has formed the subject of an inquiry, but all the facts are not yet in the possession of the public. Gunner Haines, whose picture we give, was blown to atoms, and his head has not yet bet n recovered, only some portions of his body and limbs, which enabled identification. He was a married man, the deceased's wife lives at Bridgewater and works in a factory there. As her husband only had 9s. a week pay, he could not keep her so she had to keep herself. It is reported that she gave birth to a baby several days before her husband met with such a horrible end. The man who was badly injured, and whose picture we also reproduce is Gunner Reed. One who knows every inch of the fort and magazine says that it would be an impossibility for any man to discharge the contents of a rifle into the magazine, as it is so constructed that there are two very thick walls with passages between, and that Haines must have got possession of the keys in some way, and opened the doors and then returned them, accomplishing his diabolical crime at an hour (five o'clock in the morning) when he found it possible to do so. It is firmly believed by my informant that the terrible crime was premeditated, and carried out in a manner that had been well thought over. The fort has been practically wrecked, and five thousand pounds of powder blown up. My informant is of opinion that Haines went into one of the stores of the magazine and stood over one of the barrels of powder with his rifle, and fired into it, as certain parts of his body show that he had received the full force of the explosion, being perfectly black. The damage is estimated at about £4,000. It is not thought that the fort will be rebuilt for some time as it is said that the military authorities contemplate making other arrangements.

BREAN DOWN EXPLOSION  
The Inquest.

The inquest on Gunner Haines was held on Friday, before Dr. Craddock, coroner, at the Wellington hotel, Berrow. After the jury had viewed the body, one of their number, Mr. J. A. Dare, insisted, against the wishes of the majority, on going to see the fort. The jury then went see the spot in a break, but met Mr. Dare, who had gone on in advance, returning in company with an artillery officer, who explained that a Government inquiry was going on, and hoped that the Coroner's witnesses might speedily be released. The party then returned to Berrow, where the inquiry was resumed. The evidence of Sergeant James Withers, Gunner George Johnson, Bombr. J. P. Shillabeer, Gunner W. C. Kehoe, Gunner F. Gibbs, and Master Gunner Brett was taken, and after the Coroner had summed up, the jury returned the following verdict: "Killed by No. magazine on Brean Bown exploding, which explosion was caused by the deceased firing a carbine loaded with ball cartridge down the shaft of the ventilator to the magazine whilst in a state of temporary insanity."

MAGAZINE EXPLOSION NEAR WESTON.

A serious explosion occurred in a magazine containing 5,000 lb. of powder at Brean Down Fort, near Weston-super-Mare on Wednesday, a gunner named Haines being killed, and several men injured. The cause is unexplained, but it is stated that Haines returned to the fort at midnight from Burnham, returning to his quarters immediately. Just before five in the morning the explosion occurred, and Haines's body was found near the magazine smashed to atoms. He had no business near the spot at that hour. One injured man was removed to hospital, and others less seriously hurt were attended to at the fort.

>It is reported that the officer in command at Brean Down Fortress has received intimation that her Majesty's Government intends to demolish the buildings there so that it shall cease be a fortified rook. It was at this fort that a disastrous explosion recurred some time ago. Of late. since the "Bristol Channel Defence" question cropped up, and the neighbourhood was visited by a man-of-war, great alterations and improvements have been in course of completion there ; but now, after a great expenditure of money,  the Government, it is reported, do not see the importance of fortifications at this point.

In a review of the major event of the previous year, the *Weston Mercury* of Saturday, 5th January, 1901, [p2](https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0001334/19010105/042/0002) reported:

> The most sensational event of the year, however, was the terrific explosion at Brean Down Fort in the early morning July 4th, occasioned by an artilleryman named Haines discharging his carbine into the powder magazine. As a result of the explosion Haines was blown fragments, a comrade was severely injured, the cannon were thrown from the carriages, and the major portion of the fort wrecked.

The first anniversary of the event was also noted by the *Gloucestershire Echo* of Thursday, 4th July, 1901, [p3](https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000320/19010704/064/0003):

> BREAN DOWN FORT.
>
> About year ago it will be remembered that an explosion took place at Brean Down Fort, when a powder magazine was blown out and a gunner killed. The authorities having decided to remove all the guns, this laborious task has now been practically completed, the carriages and other parts, regarded worthless for the purpose of war, passed through Burnham Tuesday, drawn by a traction engine. Some weeks have been spent in making a road for the engine to ascend from the shore to the summit of Brean Down and thence to the fort. Brean Down Fort is now a thing of the past.

A HOME DEFENCE LEAGUE.
[TO THE EDITOR OF THE "SPECTATOR"}

SIR,—Like your correspondent, "H. H. K.," I have been "watching your columns every week," and, I may add, the columns of the Times every day, "to find some keen outward response" to the suggestions that "a society should be formed to concern itself with the organisation and develop. ment of our military resources." It will never be well with this great Empire and its peoples until a system of "thorough" has been established in every department of the State. We as a nation make a profession of two things, both of which are in their essence "thorough." We profess the religion of Christ, and we claim to be scientific. In this one principle of "thoroughness" the religion of Christ and modern science are absolutely at one. Christ says, "If thine eye be single thy whole body shall be full of light." Science says, "Gather your facts, and exclude all else; comprehend your facts ; base your conclusions and your conduct on the facts alone." That is, "Fix your eye solely on the facts, and then you shall know the truth." In like manner, Christ says, "If thy hand offend thee, rut it off : If thine eye offend thee. pluck it out." So science, us in medicine and surgery, in dealing with an evil of any kind, says always,—," First find out the cause of the evil ; then remove it." When this is done your cure is on the way to being complete. Without this there can be no care at all. In other words, true religion and true science are thoroughly absolute and absolutely thorough. In the affairs of the State this very principle of thoroughness, and no other, must be adopted; and now, more than ever, when the Empire is so in- finitely complex in its interests and so vast in its magnitude. Honesty we have in our public depart. ments; honesty, that is to say, so that nobody steals, lies are not encouraged, and jobbery is so rare as to be a factor of little importance. But "thoroughness," most assuredly not. And whilst we have not thoroughness we cannot have real honesty in any high and wide sense; much less can we have efficiency. Are we the least likely to have thoroughness, with its corresponding efficiency, in the "organisation and development of our military resources," if things are left in the hands of party politicians and of the permanent officials of the War Department ? All past experience says "No." If things be so left, what we shall have in the future will be what we have had in the past. A new organisation is needed : rather, an "Army League," per- haps, than a mere "Home Defence League." It should con- sist of persons, being voters, who have no private axes to grind, and who will have the conscience, the deliberateness, and the force of character to gather all the facts necessary for the formation of right judgments ; and then to insist and persist until those facts have told their tale and produced their fruit in the right quarter. In this country every voter is a legally and constitutionally established factor in the State. He is a son of the house, and it is not only his right, but his duty, to do everything which is in his power for the safety, the prosperity, and the honour of the house. He should refuse to be ground down by any person whatever. On a memorable occasion the great leader and statesman, Moses, said to some sycophants : "Would that all the Lord's people were prophets." In like manner, every modern statesman who is worth the name will say : "Would that every voter were an intelligent politician, and insisted upon contributing of the very best that is in him to the purifying and strengthening of the State in every department." I hope many of your readers will join with me in asking you, Sir, to use your influence in the most strenuous way towards the speedy establishment of a right "Army League."—I am, Sir, &c., It seems to us that the best thing to begin with is for men who feel with our correspondent to form small committees each in his own district or parish, and then to affiliate with other committees throughout the Kingdom till a central organisation is built up.—ED. Spectator.]

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR.
THE ARMY LEAGUE.

[To THE EDITOR OF' TILE "SPECTATOR."]

was high time for some one to set on foot an active movement in this urgent matter of Home, or rather Imperial, Defence, and we, therefore, after watching in vain for signs from "the lights that (should) guide us," have ventured to step in. Readers of your recent numbers will be cognisant of the general scope of the above-named League, and an attempt at this juncture to give specific details would obviously be premature. However, I beg to enclose a copy of the notice which the members of a small provisional committee are distributing among friends. One friend has patriotically offered to the League, for such period as may be necessary, the free use of offices situated at 8 King Street, Cheapaide, whither all communications should be addressed. We appeal to all good citizens to send in their names, and, in reason, their suggestions. We make a particular appeal to those men to do likewise whose names will lend influence and whose special knowledge will give weight to our counsels. We would wish our permanent committee to be formed mainly from among such men. The provisional members will, once the organisation is set upon a firm basis, hand it over willingly to abler hands. The present need is for the accession to our ranks of large numbers of earnest recruits.—I am, Sir, &C., H. HARCOURT KENT. Grafton Cottage, Sandgate.

"Tux ARMY LEAGUE.—Dear Sir,—If you are interested In the formation, under proper auspices, of a Society to concern itself with the organisation and development of the military resources of the Empire at this crisis in its history—in much the same way that the Navy League concerns itself with our naval resources—will you be good enough to forward your name and address, without delay, to the Secretary (pro tern), Army League, 8 King Street, Cheapside, E.C. No pledge is given by sending in one's name now. Full details as to the aims and constitution of the League will be furnished before a final decision as to joining it is required. Immediate steps of a practical kind are contemplated. If every person who agrees in the main with the scheme will do his share, both by sending in his own name at once and by obtaining those of others, an efficient working organisation will be speedily estab- lished. The offices in King Street have been freely lent to the League, and there are at present no material expenses. The cooperation of gentlemen who can assist in the way of formation of affiliated local committees will be welcomed. A most en- couraging amount of support has already been met with during the short time the organisation has been in existence. The ultimate details of our programme must largely depend upon the resolutions arrived at in the conclave of experts which we hope to assemble; meanwhile the following indications may be given as to its general outlines. In the first place, the Army League will be entirely non-political. Acting on behalf of, and as representing, the man in the street,' it will aim at bringing to bear on the Government that support and pressuro for whieh governments nowadays seem to wait and, indeed, to ask. While this League is in full sympathy with th., objects of the Navy League, the British Empire League, and with all that tends towards Imperial Federation, its special work will lie in the direction of pressing, by all legitimate and con- stitutional means, for

(1) A thorough organisation and development of our military system, including, The creation of an Army sufficient and efficient for tha needs of the Empire.

A comprehensive scheme of Imperial defence ; and Included in the above, but the urgent question of the moment, immediate and adequate provision for home defence.

Important questions connected with the development of our Volunteer Forces, with the institution of military drill both at schools and for lads after leaving school, and with the provision of increased facilities for rifle practice will necessarily claim attention.

That the British people at last begins to realise the gravity of the general situation is evident from the widespread display of feeling, both public and private, and the Army League offers itself as a convenient channel for the concrete, and therefore effective, expression of this strong national sentiment. What was done a few years since for the Navy, thanks mainly to orderly agitation in the Press and by the Navy League, may surely be by sin) ilannethodsaveomplished at the present juncture forthe Army. It must be steadfastly borne in mind that a speedy and successful conclusion of the Boer War will not affect in any material degree the ever-present necessity for the reorganisation and development a our military resourees.—THE PROVISIONAL COMMITTEE."

[The Army League has our warmest good wishes in the work it has undertaken.—ED. Spectator.]

THE ARMY LEAGUE.
[To THE EDITOR OF THE "SPECTATOR.']

feel sure that all good citizens will hail with satis- faction the establishment of an Army League with the aims and objects set forth in the letter of Mr. H. H. Kent in the Spectator of March 3rd, and I have in expression of my sympathy -with the movement sent in my name to the Provisional Committee as requested in his appeal. I have ventured, however, to suggest for the consideration of that Committee that the mention in their circular of "our Volun- teer Forces" and the omission of the Militia Forces might lead to a misunderstanding, and to the preventing many from joining who, like myself, are of opinion that a well-organised, strong, and thoroughly efficient Militia Force should form the backbone of our home defence army. I think it should be understood that this force, being of a more permanent character, and therefore more certain to be available, should be the first to be thoroughly brought up to the requirements of the day, equipped with transport, &c., and organised with field artillery and Yeomanry, so as to admit of its being mobilised for home defence at the shortest notice. Then (or at the same time if possible) our splendid Volunteer Forces should be in like manner equipped and organised with mounted infantry, &c. Thus would the immediate and adequate provision for home defence be, in my opinion, best fulfilled, and this should, I think, stand first in the list of the four chief needs which, as the circular of the Committee truly states, are essential to the maintenance of our Empire.—I am,

Sir, &c., INFANTRY LIEUTENANT-COLONEL.

THE ARMY LEAGUE.
[To THE EDITOR OF THE "SPECTATOR.") Sir,—You will have seen from the reports in the daily papers that the Army League, in which you have taken such a kindly interest, was formally (and, I think, very successfully) inaugurated on Tuesday at the United Service Institution. Many of your readers are, I know, interested in the movement, and I should like to be allowed to state in your paper the result of the meeting. There was some slight disagreement as to the order in which the resolutions should be put to the meeting, but on the following points there was, so far as I could judge, complete unanimity of opinion :— 

(I) That our existing military organisation is dangerously deficient.

(2) That no Government will deal adequately with the subject unless forced to do so by the pressure of public opinion.

(3) That the public generally is ignorant of the real state of affairs.

(4) That when it understands the military position of the country the public will express its opinion in a way that cannot be ignored by Government. Tbat it will, in fact, issue that "mandate" which we are told the Government desires to receive before taking action.

(5) That it is therefore necessary to lose no time in enlightening the public as to the facts,—and (6) That this is to be the principal business of the "Army League." —I am, Sir, &c.,
