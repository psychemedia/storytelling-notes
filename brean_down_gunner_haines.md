MAGAZINE EXPLOSION BREAN DOWN. ONE GUNNER KILLED, ANOTHER INJURED.

An inexplicable and serious explosion, which caused the death of a gunner and wrecked the fort, occurred at Brean Down at 5 a.m. yesterday. The officers in charge of the fort are naturally very reticent regarding the affair, but from inquiries on the spot it was ascertained that ordinarily there are four men on the Down in charge of Sergeant-Major Withers, A few days ago, however, the strength of the garrison was augmented by the arrival of about 14 men from the Flat and Steep Holmes for preliminary gun practice to fit them for their annual firing. Among these new arrivals were Ganner Haines — the soldier woo was killed by the explosion — and Gunner Johnson, who left the Down on Tuesday soon after 5 o'clock and proceeded to Burnham to fetch their bicycles, which they left there on a previous visit. They left Burnham 8.30, but parted company on tho road in consequence of a mishap to Haines's machine, Johnson reaching the fort between 10 and 11. The deceased gunner reached his quarters close upon midnight, and both he and his comrade should have reported themselves by 10 p.m. Haines is said have been perfectly sober, and on his arrival at the fort went to bed and was seen by a comrade in the same room at 1 a.m. yesterday. Nothing unusual occarred until some four hours later, when the whole of those in the barracks were aroused by an alarming explosion, which shook the buildings. The report was heard at Cardiff, Weston, and Barnham. The whole of the garrison immediately turned out, and it was ascertained that the magazine in the south-wast corner of the fort had exploded. The absence of Gunner Haines was also noticed, and a search being instituted his body was found in a pit, caused by the explosion,  in the magazine. The wreckage caused by explosion was very considerable. Only one of the other men suffered any serious injury, and this was Gunner Reed, the artery of one of his arms being badly cut by some oe the falling *débris*. The force of ths explosion was visible some hundred yards before reaching the fort, huge stones, iron girders, and other wreckage being strewn about the Down. Inside the fort, however, the scene was remarkable. There are seven 7-inch guns in the fort, and the two in the south-west corner were thrown off their mountings, which were damaged beyond further servtce, and turned over. The barracks were much damaged, all the windows being broken and the roofs and walls shattered. Immediately after the explosion Sergt.-Major Withers proceededto Weston, and notified Dr. Phelps of tha affair. The doctor once went to the Down, and tha injured gunner was ordered to be brought to the Weston Hospital, where he was detained. The magazine reported to have been duly locked and secured on Tuesday, and how the gunner who lost his life came to be where his body was found — or how he effected entrance into the magazine — are points that remain to be cleared up. The deceased was a soldier of some 13 years' service, and had a record for good service, albeit described as somewhat sullen. The magazine contained several thousand pounds of explosives. No  civilian is allowed to inspect the fort, which was viewed at 12 o'clock yesterday morning Captain Wilkins. R.A., Lieut. Beardsley, R.A., aod Captain Paske, R.E., who came across by steam lannch from Cardiff. Gunner Haines was a married man, and his widow resides at 136, Bristol Road, Bridgwater.

THE MAGAZINE EXPLOSION BREAN DOWN.

INQUEST.

Dr. Craddock held an inquest at Borrow Hotel, yesterday, on Gunner Haines, who was killed in the explosion of a magazine at Brean Down fort on Wednesday.

Sergt. Bartlett, having stated that the deceased was 31 years of age, the following evidence taken :—

Sergt. James Withers said : I am a Sergeant in the Royal Artillery and stationed at Brean Down fort. William Haines was a gunner. I last saw him alive at 5 p.m. om the 3rd. inst. He was then in company with Gunner Johnstone going for a walk. He was perfectly sober at that time. On the following morning, about ten minutes to five o'clock, I heard a violent explosion. We went out to see what had happened and found that No. 3 cartridge store had exploded. We at once called the roll and found the deceased absent. The Master-Gunner called the roll. We inspected the store in company with Master-Gunner Brett, and there found the remains of a human being. The remains were in the centre of the floor of the cartridge store. The door of the magazine was locked at two pm., when witness was there. When witness next saw the door it was blown to pieces. There were nine or ten steps to get to the door. The only means of identification were by a ring which the deceased wore. A carbine was foond by Gunner Gibbs in the magazine yesterday morning. The Coroner: What means are adopted to prevent anyone getting into the store?—Witness: I don't see how anyone could get in. It is 10 or 12 feet underground, and is approached by two flights of steps. Between the two sets of steps there is the entrance door. The door is secured by brass lock. I have charge of the store, and it was reported to me as being locked at 2 p.m. on the 3rd inst. by Gunner Unsted, who is responsible for locking it. The magazine is opened daily, weather permitting, from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. Gunner Kehoe reported to the Master Gunner that his carbine waa missing. I have since the remains of the carbine, it was bent, and the woodwork was gone, but the number was still to be seen. The Coroner: Hava you any duplicate keys to the magazine?— Witness: Yes, one to each door. The keys are kept in the office. Q.: Do you know if Gunner Unsted brought the key into the office? —A.: Yes, he handed it to me at two o'clock on the 3rd inst. Q.: How long had deceased been at Brean Down?—A.: He came there a week ago from Steep Holm. Q.- Has he been steady?—A.: Yes. Did he drink? —A: He had not drunk much, and the the men told me he did not have much whilst on the Holmes. A Juror: Had he been stationed at the Down previously A.: Yes, about 12 months ago. Deceased should have returned to the fort at 10 p.m., on the 3rd inst., but he did not return until some hours later. A man staying out late without permission is put under arrest.

Gunner George Johnstone stated: I am a gunner in the Royal Artillery stationed at Brean Down. On the evening of the 3rd., about five o'clock, I went out with the deceased. We walked to the Commercial Hotel at Burnham. We did not return together. We left Burnham at twenty minutes to nine o'clock on bicycles. Gunner Haines's machine broke down about halfway between here and Burnham. I came to this house and had a glass of ale, and left hero at nine o'clock and proceeded to Brean, and I arrived at the fort at 10.40. The deceased did not arrive with me. He reached the fort an hour and a half afterwards. He had to walk. I let him in. He was apparently sober. We had three glasses of ale each whilst in Burnham. I was stationed with deceased five weeks on the Steep Holm. A day or two before deceased's death I noticed a change in his manner. He became very quiet, but he did not complain of being ill. When deceased went to Burnham he was in his usual state. To knowledge deceased had not been drinking hard lately, and I have not heard from anyone that he had. When deceased came home on Tuesday night he told me he had brought his bicycle and asked what time I arrived. Deceased seemed quite right then. I have seen the deceased's remains since the explosion. I identified deceased by a ring on the right hand. I also identified him by a truss he has always worn. On Wednesday morning, after the explosion, I saw all the deceased's clothing by his bedside, even his shirt.

A Juryman: Did you ever hear the deceased make use of any threat that he would do anything of this kind ?—No.

Do know if had any disturbance with anybody?—No.

John Prowse Shillabeer said: I am a bombardier at Brean Down. I remember the deceased going to bed at 12.45 on the morning of the explosion. I spoke to the deceased and asked him what time it was. He said he did not know exactly. I wished deceased "Good night," and went to bed. We slept opposite other. I heard the explosion, which woke me up. It must have been ten minutes to five o'clock. I noticed that the deceased was not then in his bed, and I also noticed that his clothes were in the room. I have only known deceased about a week, whilst at Brean. I have not during that time noticad anything strange about him.

The Coroner: During the week he was at Brean was there anything about him to lead you to suppose that he was not quite right in his head?— Not the slightest.

A Juror: Was the carbine taken from your room?—Yes.

William Charles Kehoe said: I am a gunner at Brean. Since the explosion—an hour afterwards— I missed my rifle. I identify the stock produced as belonging to my carbine. The number is attached to the stock.

A Juror: Waa the rifle loaded when you left it? No, we have no ammunition in our possession.

Another Juror: Your rifle was more easy for him to get at ? Yes, it was near the door.

A Juror: Could the deceased get a cartridge?—I can't say.

Master Gunner Brett produced the barrel of the gun, which was very much bent, and stated that it showed that the gun had been fired.

Gunner Frederick Gibbs proved finding the barrel produced on Thursday morning about six feet from where the deceased's remains were discovered. The barrel was farther outside the magazine than the body. Witness added had known deceased since October, 1896, and the man, so far as he had known him, had always been quiet.

John Brett was next called. He said— I am master gunner, stationed temporarily at Brean Down. I am head of the establishment whilst there. have known the deceased almost three years. I have not noticed anything strange about him except that he had a violent temper. Deceased was on parade with me the day before the occurrence, and I didn't notice anything particular about him.

The Coroner—Can you account for his getting into this magazine store?—I can't; he had no business there whatever.

The Coroner— There is one point I want to ask yon. Can you account for a man being able to get hold of a ball cartridge? He could not in the fort of Brean Down. No man at the fort is served out with ammunition. It is all kept in the fort box, which is locked.

By a Juror: There was no loose powder in the magazine.

Sergeant Withers, recalled, stated that the ball cartrdiges were kept in the fort box in the office, and they were intact after the explosion. No ball cartridges had been served out. The witness stated that he could not tell whether the rifle was discharged unless the breech were opened.

A suggestion was adopted that the breach should be opened, and Sergeant Withers proceeded to a blacksmiths for purpose of doing so. On returning he produced a discharged cartridge, which was found in the breech, which satisfied him that the rifle had been fired.

The Coroner: Would it be possible for a person to fire down the ventilator and explode the magazine?— Weil, not unless the bullet struck the cylinders. There were no cylinders immediately underneath the ventilators. I examined deceased's clothing in company with P.S. Bartlett. All his clothes were in the room, so that deceased must have gone to the magazine in a naked state.

The jury returned the following verdict:— "Killed by No. 3 magazine Brean Down exploding, which explosion was caused by deceased firing a carbine loaded with ball cartridge down the shaft of the ventilator to the magazine whilst in a state of temporary insanity."
