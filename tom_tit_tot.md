pp. 239-



The incidents of this story are strikingly similar to those in " Rumpel-stilzchen." The maiden in that tale has to spin straw into gold thread, and she, like Duffy, has to discover the name of the spirit who has befriended her.

Mr Robert Chambers, in his " Popular Rhymes of Scotland," has a fairy tale in which the fairy threatens the mother that she will have her "lad bairn " unless "ye can tell me my right name." The anxious mother takes a walk in the wood, and she hears the fairy singing —

"Little kens our gude dame at hame

That 'Whuppity Stoorie' is my name."

Of course, when the fairy comes to claim the "lad bairn," she is addressed as "Whuppity Stoorie," and she at once disappears.

In "Who Built Reynir Church?" in the "Icelandic Legends" of Jon Arnason, the story turns on the discovery of the name of the builder. — Icelandic Legtnds, p. 49.

[A rumpelstiltskin style tale cornish legend]

DUFFY AND THE DEVIL.

A CORNISH LEGEND.

[We take the following amusing legend from "Popular Romances of the West of England; or, the Drolls, Traditions, and Superstitions of old Cornwall; collected and edited by Robert Hunt, F.R.S.," a work which was noticed some time ago in our columns.]

Many of the superstitions of our ancestors are preserved in quaint, irregular rhymes, the recitation of which was the amusement of the people in the long nights of winter. These were sung, or rather said, in a monotone, by the professional Drolls, who doubtless added such things as they fancied would increase the interest of the story to the listeners. Especially were they fond of introducing known characters on the scene, and of mixing up events which had occurred within the memory of the old people with the more ancient legend. The following story, or rather parts of it, formed the subject proof one of the Cornish Christmas plays. When, I was a boy, I well remember being much delighted with the coarse acting of a set of Christmas players, who exhibited in the "great hall" of a farmhouse at which I was visiting, and who gave us the principal incidents of Duffy and the Devil Terrytop; one of the company doing the part of Chorus, and filling up by rude descriptions-often in rhyme—the parts which the players could not represent.

It was in cider-making time. Squire Lovel of Trove, or more correctly, Trewouf, rode up to Burian Church-town to procure help, boys and maidens were in request, some to gather the apples from the trees, others to carry them to the cider-mill. Passing along the village as hastily as the dignity of a squire would allow him, his attention was drawn to a great noise-scolding In a shrill treble voice, and crying—proceeding from Janey Chygwin's door. The squire rode up to the cottage, and he saw the old woman beating her step-daughter Duffy about the head with the skirt of her swing tail gown, in which she had been carrying out the ashes. She made such a dust that the squire was nearly choked and almost blinded with the wood ashes.

"What cheer, Janey?" cries the squire; "what's the to-do with you and Duffy?"

"Oh, the lazy huzzy!" shouts Janey, "is all her time courscying and courranting with the boys! she will never stay in to boll the porridge, knit the stockings, or spin the yarn."

"Don't believe her, your honour," exclaims Duffy; "my knitting and spinning is the best in the parish".

The war of tongues continued in this strain for some time, the old squire looking calmly on, and resolving in his mind to take Duffy home with him to Trove, her appearance evidently pleasing him greatly. Squire Lovel left the old and young woman to do the best they could, and went round the village to complete his hiring. When he returned peace had been declared between them; but when Lovel expressed his desire to take Duffy home to his house to help the housekeeper to do the spinning, "A pretty spinner she is" shouted old Janey at the top of her voice. "Try me, your honour," said Duffy, curtseying very low; "my yarns are the best in the parish."

"We'll soon try that," said the squire; "Janey will be glad to get quits of thee, I see, and thou'lt be nothing loth to leave her; so jump up behind mle, Duffy."


TO DO

No sooner said than done, The maid Duffy, without ecre. hat mocy, mounted behind the squire on the horse, and they logged Ibly silently down to Trove. Squire Level's old housekeeper was almost blind-one eye had been put out by an angry old wizard, I WeB. inti through sympathy she was rapidly losing thc power of the s"eMng with the other. This old dame was consequently very erit glad of some one to help her In spinning and knitting, The ach Introduction over, the housekeeper takes Duffy up into the ulk earret where the wool was kept, and where the spinning was i as done in the summer, and requests her to commence her work. t icr, 'u he truth must be told Duffy was an idle slit, she codli cat neither knit nor spin. Well, here she was left alone, and, of course, expected to produce a good specimen of her work The I act, garret was piled from the floor to the key-beams with fleeces I , to of wool. Duffy looked despairingly at them, and then sat herself down on the "turt"-the spinning-wheel-and cried out, "Curse the spinning and knitting. The devil may spin and knit for the squire for what I rare." And scarcely had Duffy spoken these words than she heard ai r rustling noise behind some woolpacks, and forth walked a dof queer-looking little man, with a remarkable pair of eyes, which nd seemed to send out flashes of light. There was something Red uncommonly knowing In the twist of his mouth, and his curved he nose had an air of curious intelligence. He was dressed in it' black, and moved towards Duffy with a jaunty air, knocking c ei- something against the floor at every step he took, L "Duffy'dear," said this little gentleman, "I'll do all the a e spinning and knitting for thee." b5 "Thank's," says Duffy, quite astonished, t by "Duffy, dear, a lady shall you be." "Thank's, your honour," smiled Duffy. "But, Duffy dear, remember," coaxingly said the queer little man-"remember that for all this, at the end of three years you must go with me unless you can find out my name." Duffy was not the least bit frightened, nor did she hesitate long, but presently struck a bargain with her kind but unknown friend, who told her she had only to wish, and her every wish should be fulfilled; and as for the spinning and knitting, she would dnd all she required under the blact ram's fleece. He then departed. How, Duffy could not tell, but in a moment the queer little gentleman was gone. Duffy sung in Idleness, I and slept until it was time for tier to make her appearance. So she wished for some yarns, and looking under the black fleece she found them. Those were shown by the housekeeper to the squire, and they both declared "they had never seen such beautiful yarns." The next day Duffy was to knit this yarn into stockings. Duffy idled, as only professed idlers can be i dle; but in due time, she had been excessively industrious, she produced a pair of stockings for the old squire. If the yarn was beautiful, the stockings were beyond all praise. They were as fine as silk, and as strong as leather. Squire Lovel soon gave them a trial; and when he came home that night after hunting, he declared he would never wear any other than Duffy's stockings. He had wandered all day through brake and briar, furze and brambles, there was not a scratch on his legs, and lh was as dry as a bone. There was no end to hls praise of Duffy's stockings, ten Duffy had a rare time of it now-she could do what she pleased, and rove where she willed. She was dancing on tle Pr; small-bed half the day, with all the gossiping women who brought their grist to bo ground. la thioso ' good old times" It is the ladies of the parish would take their corn to mllaod serge pos . tho lur themselves, When a few of them met together, they would either tell stories, or dance whilst the corn was grinding. Sometimes the dance would be on the mill-bed, sometimes out side on the green. On scme occasions the miller's fiddle would be wit in request, at others the "arowd "((a sievoeovered with sheep. tha, eskial WveB made to do the duty a of tambourine. So Duffy was at if always finding excuses to go to mill. and many "a round' was would she dance with the best people in the parish. Old Bet, the miller's wife, was a witch, and heb found out evie who did Duffy's work for her. Duffy and old Bet were always the best of friends, and she never told any one about Duffy's knitting friend, nor did she ever say a word about the stockings being unfinished. There was always a stilte doenlc. timi On Sundays the people went to Barlan Church, from all parts, to look at the squire's stockings; and ho olli squire fo rg would stop at the Cross, proud enough to show them. llt could feet hunt out; il Through brambles clitl hi rCe il all arts of weather arci Ilfs ol shaliiks were at soind oc i fboend illt ini leutiier." bert Duffy was now sought after by all the young totcli of the lihg country; and at last the squire, fearing to lose a pretty girl, trun and one who was aio useful to him, married her himself, and pow she became.,according to the fashion of rite time and place, fnos Lady Level; but she wai commonly known by her neighbours as the Duffy Lady. the Lady Lovel kept the devil hard at work. Stockingte, all like sorts of lie uqderclothing, Pedding, and mhulgh orsnagutal p1 |work, the like of which was t never acen. was produced at eom- muand, and plaaStd oi ansher own. Duffy pased nlev tmerytm of it, but somehow or other she was never happy when she was eomopeled to play the lady. She p Rs~ed m ueh moere of her tiie with the old crone at tho mill than In the drawing--rooms at Trove. The squire sported aud ank and ard c little about Duffy, so long as she provided with knitted garments, The three years were nearly at an end. Duffy had tried every plan to find out the devil's name, but had failed in all. She began to fear that she should have to go with her queer friend, and Duffy became melancholy. Old Bet endeavoured to rouse her, persuading her that she could, from her long experience, and many dealings with the imps of darkness, at the last moment put her in the way of escaping her doom. Duffy went day after day to her garret, and there each day was the devil gibing and zeerieg till she was almost mad. There was but another day. Bet was seriously consulted now, and as good as her word, she promised to use her power. Duffy Lady was to bring down to the mill that very c'enhlg a Jack of the strongest beer she had in the cellar. She was not to go to bed until the Squire returned from hunting, no matter how late, and she waged to make no remark in reply to anything the squire might tell her. The Jack of beer was duly carried to the mill, acd Duffy returned home very melancholy to wait for the squire. No sooner had Lady Loy left the mill than old Bet came out with the "c erowd or her shoulders, and the blackjack in her hand, She shut the door, and turned the water off the mill-w bel,-threw her red cloak about her, and away. She was seen by her neighbours going, towards Belelt. A man saw the old woman trudging past the Pipers, and through the Dawnse Main into the downs, but there he lost sight of her, and no one could tell where old Bet was gone to at that time of night. Duffy waited long and anxiously. By and by the dogs came brine alone. They were covered with ??, their tongues were hanging out of their mouths, and all the servants said they must have mt he avi's ouds ithutheads. Duffy was seriously alarmed. Midnight came but no squire. At last he arrived, but like a crazy, eranek-brained man, he kept singing, "Itereasto Ihoe devil, With his wooden pick and shovel." He was neither drunk nor frightened, but wild with some strange excitement. After a long time Squire Lovel sat down, and began, "My dear Duffy. you haven't smiled this long time; but now I'll tell 'e something that would make ye laugh if you're dying. If you'd seen what I've seen to-night, ha, ha, ha I licere' to the devil, . 'ith hie wooden pick and shovel." True to her orders, Duffy said not a word, but allowed the Equire to ramble on as he plerted, At length he told her the following story of his adventures, with interruptions which have not bean retained, and with numerous coarse expressions which are best forgotten:- "Duffy, dear, I left home at break of day this morning. I hunted all the moors from Trove to Trevider, and never started a hare all the live-long day. I determined to hunt all right but that I'd have a brace to bring home, So, at nightfall I went down Lemorna Bottom3, then up Brene Downsee, and as we passed the Daw SeC Main up started a hare, as fine a hare as ever was seen. She passed the Pipers, down through the ateens, in the Month of the dogs halt the, time, yet they couldn't catch her at all, As fine a chase as ever was seen, until she took into the Fugoe Hole.* In went the dogs after her, and I followed, the owls and bats fairground my head. On we went, through water and mud, a mile or more, I'm quite certain. I didn't know the place was so loig before. 'At last w came to a broad pool of water, when the dogs lost the scent, and ran back past me howling and jowling. terrified almost to death. A little further on I turned round a corner, and saw a glimmering fire on the other side of the water, and there were St. Leven witches in scores. Some were riding. on ragwort, some on brooms some were floating on their three-legged stools, and some, who had been milking the little good cowain Wales, bad some back astride of the largest lceks the could find, Amongst the rest there was our Bet of the lill, with her 'crowd' in ber hand, and my own blackjack slung across her shoulders. In a short time the witches gathered round the fire, and blowed it up, after a strange fashion, till it burned up into a brilliant blue flame. Then I saw amongst the rest a queer little man In black, with a long forked tail, which be held high in the air and twirled around. Bet struck her crowd as soon as he appeared, nod beat up the tune, 3lerce to the devil, With hiH wooden pick and shovel, N Pging tis by ile busel, WitT hifi tal ock'd up I' Then the queer little devil and all danced like the wind, and went faster aed faster, making such a Clatter, as if they had on each toot a pewter platter.' Every time the man in black came round by old Bet, he took a good pull from my own blackjack, till at first, as if he had been drinking my best beer, he seemed to have lost his head, when he jumped up and down, turned round and round, and roaring with laughter, sung, Duffy, my lady, you'll never Im now-what? -. That my name is Terrytop, Terrytop-.top1' When the squire sung those lines, he stopped suddenly, thinking that Duffy was going to die. She turned pale and red, and pale again. However, Duffy erdd nothing, and the squire proceeded;-' After the dance, all the witches made a ring around the fire, and again blew it up, until the blue flames reached the top of the 'Zawn.'t Then the devil danced through and through the fire, and springing ever and anon amongst the witches, kicked them soundly. At last-I was shaking with laughter at the tun-r shouted, 'Go it, Old Nick qind, lo, the lights went out, And I had to fly with all my speed, for everyone of the witches wore after me, I scampered )onmc somehow, and here I am. Why don't you laugh, Duffy?" Duffy did laugh, and laugh right heartily now, and when tired of their Ifo, the squire and the lady went to bed, The three years were up within an hour, Duffy had willed for an abundant supply of knitted things, and filled every chest In the house, She was in the best chamber trying to eram come more stockings Into a big chest, when the queer little man in black appeared before her, r Vell, Duffy, my dear," said hc, f have been to my word, and served you truly for three years as we agreed, so now I hope you will go with me, and make no objection." He bowed very obsequiously, almost to the ground, and regarded Duffy Lady with a very offensive leer. "I fear," smiled Duffy, "that your country is rather warm, and might spolt my fair complexion." ,,It is not so hot as some people say, Duffy," was his reply; "but come along, I've kept my word, and of course a lady of your standing will kelp your word also. Can you tell me my name "

Duffy curtsied, and smilingly said, "You have behaved like a true gentleman, yet I wouldn't like to go so far." The devil frowned, and approached as if he would lay forcible hands upon her. "Maybe your name is Lucifer?"

He stamped his foot and grinned horridly. "Lucifer! Lucifer! He is no other than a servant to me in my own country." Suddenly calming again, he said quietly, "Lucifer! I would scarcely be seen speaking to him at court. But come along. When I spin for ladies I expect honourable treatment at their hands. You've two guesses more. But they are of little use; my name is not generally known on earth."

"Perhaps," smiled Duffy again, "my lord's name Is Beelzebub?"

How he grinned, and his sides shook with convulsive joy.

"Beelzebub!" says he; "why, he's little better than the other, a common devil, he. I believe he's some sort of a cousin — a Cornish cousin, you know."

"I hope your honour," curtsied Duffy, "will not take offence. Impute my mistake to ignorance."

Our Demon was rampant with joy; he danced around Duffy with delight, and was, seeing that she hesitated, about to seize her somewhat roughly.

"Stop! stop!" shouts Duffy; "perhaps yon will be honest enough to admit that your name is Terrytop?"

The gentleman in black looked at Duffy, and she steadily looked him in the face. "Terrytop! deny it if you dare," says she.

"A gentleman never denies his name," replied Terrytop, drawing himself up with much dignity. "I did not expect to be beaten by a young minx like you, Duffy but the pleasure of your company is merely postponed." Wth this Terrytop departed in fire and smoke, and all the devil's knitting suddenly turned to ashes.

Squire Lovel was out hunting, away far on the moors; the day was cold and the winds piercing. Suddenly the stockings dropped from his legs and the homespun from his back, so that he come home with nothing on but his shirt and his shoes, almost dead with cold. All this was attributed by the squire to the influence of old Bet, who, he thought, had punished him for pursuing her with his dogs when she had assumed the form of a hare.

The story, as told by the Drolls, now rambles on. Duffy cannot furnish stockings. The squire is very wroth. There are many quarrels—mutual recriminations. Duffy's old sweet-heart is called in to beat the squire, and eventually peace is procured, by a stratagem of old Bets, which would rather shock the sense of propriety in these our days.

There is a tradition firmly believed on the lower side of Burian, that Fugoe Hole extends from the cliffs under ground so far that the end of it is under the parlour co the Tremewen's house in Trove, which is the only remaining portion of the old mansion of the Lovels. Here the witches were in the habit of meeting the devil, and holding their Sabbath. Often his dark highness has been heard piping, while the witches danced to his music. A pool of water some distance from the entrance prevents any adventurer from exploring the "Hole" to its termination. Hares often take refuge in the Fugoe Hole, from which they have never been known to return.

Zawn — a cavernous gorge.

WHUPPITY STOORIE. [As narrated by the same Nurse Jenny.]

' I ken ye're fond o' clashes aboot fairies, bairns ; and a story anent a fairy and the guidwife o* Kittlerumpit has joost come into my mind ; but I canna very weel tell ye noo whereabouts Kittlerumpit lies. I think it's somewhere in amang the Debateable Grund ; onygate I'se no pretend to mair than I ken, like a' body noo-a-days. I wuss they wad mind the ballant we used to lilt langsyne —

**Mony ane sings the gerss, the gerss, And mony ane sings the com ; And mony ane clatters o' bold Robin Hood, Ne'er kent where he was bom.**

But hoosoever, aboot Kittlerumpit: the goodman was a vaguing sort o' a body ; and he gaed to a fair ae day, and not only never came hame again, but never mair was heard o'. Some said he listed, and ither some that the wearifu' pressgang cleekit him up, though he was clothed wi' a wife and a wean forbye. Hech-how! that dulefu' pressgang! they gaed aboot the kintra like roaring lions, seeking whom they micht devoor. I mind weel, my auldest brither Sandy was a' but smoored in the meal ark hiding frae thae limmers. After they war gane, we pu'd him oot frae amang the meal, pechin' and greetin', and as white as ony Corp. My mither had to pike the meal oot o' his mooth wP the shank o' a horn spoon.

*Aweel, when the goodman o' Kittlerumpit was gane, the goodwife was left wi' a sma' fendin. Little gear had
