# Skimmington Ride

I came across this strange custom when searching for court cases involving pubs and inns and disorderly behavior in Berrow and Burnham whilst producing story notes on the tale of Brean Down Fort and Gunner Haines.

ROUGH JUSTICE

IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES and at different times cert tain customs have prevailed supplying the want of a *lex scripta*. Whenever, for instance, public morality has been outraged, or domestic dissensions disturb the peace of the neighbourhood, or an incongruous marriage seems likely to turn the holy estate into ridicule, these cases, though beyond the cognisance of the law, come under the notice of a kind of Lynch law, which restrains evil-doers most effectually.

In Africa Mumbo Jumbo takes upon himself the task of chastising faithless wives and tyrannical husbands, and doubtless has his hands pretty full of business; but it is of countries nearer home that I propose to speak. While travelling in the west of France, and reposing for a night in a country village, I was awoke by a most unearthly noise about midnight, the direct combination of shrieks and groans and howling that I ever heard. Hastily dressing myself, I awoke my host, an Englishman, and as he wished me to see all I could of the manners and customs of the people, we sallied out to see what was going on in the village. Guided by the demoniacal uproar, we soon reached the scene of action, and keeping under the shade of some large trees, could look on unperceived. A party of between twenty and thirty young men were amusing themselves by giving one of their neighbours a "*Charivari*." What may be the meaning of the term I know not; but, in the present instance, the *charivari* was performed to a number of men disguising themselves in the most outlandish costumes and masks, and making night hideous with horns, and bagpipes, and drums, and all kinds of rough music. Some had donned sheep, goat, or wolf skins, heads and all; and one who appeared to be a ringleader, was disguised as a *gendarme*. They carried rude torches, which shed a fitful glare upon the motley assembly, and every now and then they recited doggrel verses in aggravation of the couple whom they had come to serenade.

On inquiring how these people had incurred the anger of their neighbours, I found that the head and front of the old farmer's offending was that, although his wife had been dead only six months, he had that day married again to a young girl on his farm. Second marriages are considered highly objectionable, especially when the wife is young and the husband in the sere and yellow leaf.

The continued noise and the insulting songs had the effect of aggravating the old Benedict at last to such a degree that he appeared at the bedroom window in his nightcap, with an old gun in his hand, which he threatened to fire among his tormentors if they did not disperse; but as these threats were received only with derisive shouts of *vieux cornichon*, &c., he deliberately fired into the "brown" of them, but the small shot did no harm against the thick sheepskins, and after breaking a few of the old chap's windows, the assembly went off to another parish to serenade a termagant wife.

In Wales a similar custom prevails; but, at any rate in Cardiganshire, the fun is more fast and furious, for the offending party is dragged out of bed and mounted on a plank or rail, called the "ceffyl-carfan," and ridden round the village. Here also disparity of age or a second marriage excites the wrath of the populace, and a spitfire or a drunkard is pretty sure to rfide the "ceffyl," and eventually get a cooling in the parish pond.

The ducking-stool is gone out of date, and the gag for unruly tongues is found only in museums; but a custom still obtains in Dorsetshire, called "Skimmington riding," which is of great antiquity and authority. It is practised whenever the morality or temper of married couples become matters of town talk, especially if the husband patiently submits to his wife's ill conduct. On such occasions two individuals of the baser sort, one armed with a skimmer (from whence the name of Skimmington), the other with a ladle, proceed to ride round the town in a cart or on donkeys in the dusk of the evening. They are dressed to represent the obnoxious husband and wife, and are attended by a mob of followers. Arriving at the house of the parties represented, they go through a dialogue of abuse and recrimination, and belabour each other furiously with their culinary weapons as well as their tongues. The parties who parade the streets with the principal performers sweep with besoms the doorsteps of those who are likely to require a similar visitation.

Our readers will remember that Hudibras meets a Skimmington, canto ii, 685, and mistakes it for a religious procession:

Quoth Ralpho, you mistake the matter,  
For all the antiquity you smatter  
Is but a riding used of course,  
When the grey mare's the better horse, &c.

Sir Walter Scott says that "a similar ritual of popular interference prevailed in his time in Scotland, in case of gross scandal, or nuptial transgressions and public quarrels in a household. It was called 'riding the stang,' the peccant party being seated across a pole (or stang) in no very comfortable position."

Dorsetshire Birth, Death, and Marriage Customs and Superstitions

by J. S. Udal, F. R. Hist. Soc.

pp.182-200 and in particular, under *Marriage Customs*, at pp. 194-200

(viii.) Skimmington Riding. — No account of Dorsetshire customs connected with marriages would be complete without some reference to a "Skimmington," or, as it is sometimes called, a "Skimmity Riding," which is a kind of matrimonial lynch law or pillory intended for those in a lower class of life, who, in certain glaring particulars, may have transgressed their marital duties, and have thus brought upon themselves this, the strongest expression of outraged public opinion that a country district is capable of conveying. There is such an excellent and full description, both as to what a "Skimmington riding" is, and of the causes for which it takes place, given in Roberts' *History of Lyme Regis*, published in 1834, that I cannot do better than quote it in full here:— "Skimmington riding still continues to hold its ground. In an account I gave of it to the late Sir Walter Scott in 1828 is the information contained in this narrative. Skimmington riding is a great moral agent, not perhaps so much in restraining the vicious as in causing them to shun public observation, thereby not holding out bad examples to the rising youth of both sexes; in a word, it checks those instances of openly profligate and licentious conduct, which else might become too prevalent among the lower orders, who cannot, like their superiors, have recourse to legal proceedings against the person who has injured them, or divorce; it brands with infamy all gross instances of licentiousness, and exposes to lasting ridicule those couples who by their dissensions disturb the quiet and order of the neighbourhood, and so set a bad example either by struggling for domestic ascendancy, or by their quarrelsome dispositions. A Skimmington riding makes many laugh; but the parties for whom they ride never lose the ridicule and disgrace which it attaches. So far, it is a punishment, like the visit of Mumbo Jumbo in Africa. `[The value of Mr. Roberts' allusion to Mumbo Jumbo may not be thoroughly appreciated by all my readers, for only recently in *Notes and Queries* a discussion has arisen as to whether Dickens (who, it appears from Forster's *Life*, vol. ii., p. 409, had accused Carlyle of ignorance upon this point) himself understood who or what Mumbo Jumbo really was. By a very curious conicidence, on the evening of the very clay upon which I had penned the above lines taken from the *History of Lyme Regis* I happened to be reading the last number of *Notes and Queries*, sent out to me from England, and in that very number (July 30th, 1892, 8th Series, ii., 95) occurred the solution of this very question, taken from Mungo Park's *Travels in the Interior of Africa* (1799), which work is quoted upon this point, I believe, in Brand's *Popular Antiquities*, and where in all probability Roberts, if, indeed, he had not seen the original *Travels*, obtained his reference. There are two accounts given in the above number of *N. & Q.*, and as they appear to me so very interesting as affording something very like an African prototype of on* Dorset "Skimmington" I make no apology for reproducing a portion of the shorter of them herein the shape of a note:— "As the Kaffirs are not restricted in the number of their wives, every one marries as many as he can conveniently maintain; and as it frequently happens that the ladies do not agree among themselves, family quarrels sometimes rise to such a height that the authority of the husband can no longer preserve peace in his household. In such cases the interposition of Mumbo Jumbo is called in, and is always decisive. This strange minister of justice (who is supposed to be either the husband himself or some person instructed by him) disguised in the dress that has been mentioned, and armed with the rod of public authority, announces his coming by loud and dismal screams in the woods near the town. He begins the pantomime at the approach of night, and as soon as it is dark he enters the town. The ceremony commences with songs and dances, which continue till midnight, about which time Mumbo fixes on the offender. The unfortunate victim being seized, is stripped, tied to a post, and severely scourged with Mumbo's rod, amidst the shouts and derision of the whole assembly. Daylight puts an end to the unseemly revel."]` The following are the principal causes for riding the Skimmington:— (i.) When a man and his wife quarrel and he gives up to her. (ii.) When a woman is unfaithful to her husband, and he patiently submits without resenting her conduct, (iii.) Any grossly licentious conduct on the part of married persons. The first cause appears to answer that recorded in *Hudibras*, canto ii., line 685. The knight having mistaken a Skimmington for some other procession, is undeceived as follows:—

"Quoth Kalpho, "You mistake, the matter,  
For all th' antiquity you smatter,  
*Is but a riding used, of course,*  
*When the grey mare's the better horse.*  
When o'er the breeches greedy women  
Fight to extend their vast dominion,  
And in the cause impatient Grizzle  
Has drubbed her husband with ————  
And brought him under covert baron  
To turn her vassail with a murrain.  
. . . . .  
And they in mortal battle vanquished  
Are of their charter disenfranchised."

About dusk two individuals come out of some obscure street, attended by a crowd, whose laughter, huzzas &c., emulate the well-known Charivari of the French. The two performers are sometimes in a cart, at other times on a donkey, one personating the wife, the other the husband. They beat each other furiously with the culinary weapons above described, and, warmed by the applause and presence of so many spectators (for all turn out to see a Skimmington), their dialogue attains a freedom, except in using surnames, only comparable with their gestures. On arriving at the house of the parties represented in this moving drama, animation is at its height, the crowd usually stay at that spot some minutes, and then traverse the town. The performers are remunerated by the spectators; the parties that parade the streets with the performers sweep with besoms the doors of those who are likely to require a similar visitation. See Dr. King's *Miscellany*:

"When the young people ride the Skimmington  
There is a general trembling in the town;  
Not only her for whom the party rides Suffers,  
but they sweep other doors besides.  
And by that hieroglyphic does appear  
That the good woman is the master there."

Mr. Douce derives *Skimmington* from the *skimming-ladle* used in the procession. Mr. Brand says "None of the commentators on *Hudibras* have attempted an elucidation of the ceremony. Hogarth has illustrated it." Mr. Eoberts's account drew from the great "Wizard of the North " a very interesting reply, and as it gives a variant of the custom as obtaining in Scotland, and moreover Sir Walter Scott's letter may not have been otherwise published or known to my readers, I give it here:— "We had, or perhaps I might say still have, a similar ritual of popular interference in Scotland, in case of gross scandal or nuptial transgressions and public quarrels in a household. It is called 'riding the stang,' the peccant party being seated across a pole (or stang) in no very comfortable position. You will find some notice of the custom in Jamieson's *Scottish Dictionary*, *voce* Stang. I think the Doctor does not mention that men and women also were sometimes exposed to ride the stang on account of incontinence. Burns made some clever verses (not in his collected works) on a comrade of his who had been accessory to such a Saturnalian scene of punishment, in which the exposed female had suffered bodily injury, upon which account the regular police had looked after the parties who had interfered with their regular vocation. I have read in Brand's *Popular Antiquities*, or some such authority, that scholars in the English Universities were subjected to the stang when they neglect prayers. You will find a poem on the Skimmington among Prior's poems, not the folio edition, where it is omitted, but in the large collection. When they rode the Skimmington, it would seem they swept the doors of those whom they threatened with similar discipline." It will be noticed here that "Riding the Stang " approaches more nearly to the African ceremony of *Mumbo Jumbo* wherein the "peccant party" takes an active — or perhaps I should rather say a passive — part in the performance; whereas in a "Skimmington-riding" the punishment, in its physical effects at all events, is vicarious, and the whole ceremony is in character an effigy. Mr. Roberts states that in 1828 "skimming-riding" still continued to hold its ground. The lapse of another half century, with its increased enlightenment and education amongst the masses, leaves us in the same position, so far as Dorsetshire is concerned, if we believe the account given in the *Bridport News* in November, 1884, of a "skimmerton-riding" (as it is there called) that had recently occurred in the parish of Whitechurch Canonicorum in West Dorset, which is interesting as shewing us what changes (if any) have been wrought by that half century in the character of the performance. The extract is as follows: "On Wednesday, the 5th inst., this usually quiet parish was in a state of some excitement, owing to a demonstration of a peculiar character, not immediately connected with the day, which, however, was selected for the purpose by the superior judgment of the promoters. About six o'clock in the evening, just as darkness began to reign, a strange noise was heard, as of the sound of trays and kettles, and it was soon found that a 'skimmerton-riding' was in progress, such a thing not having been known for years in this parish. Three grotesquely-attired figures were to be seen escorted by a procession consisting of persons dressed in various queer and eccentric costumes, and who paraded the parish, also visiting Morcombelake and Ryal. The figures alluded to appeared to the villagers to represent three personages who were very well known to 'them, there being a male and two females, whose past conduct had caused them to be made the subject of this queer exhibition. The two female characters were conveyed about on the backs of what are described as 'celebrated Jerusalems,' which certainly seemed pretty well to enter into the joke, for one of them particularly displayed his innate agility in a surprising manner. One of the females was represented as having an extraordinary long tongue, which was tied back to the neck, whilst in one hand she held some note-paper, and in the other pen and holder. Those forming the procession were literally 'wetted' at the various inns, and after their perambulations were concluded they repaired to a certain field where a gallows was erected, and on which the effigies were hung and afterwards burnt, having previously been well saturated with some highly inflammable liquid. Nearly two hundred people assembled in the field, and a flaming light was maintained by torches. The extraordinary proceedings terminated with a fight, in which black eyes and bloody noses were not absent. However, the Riot Act was not read, the military was not called out, and the crowd dispersed about midnight, when the village resumed its wonted quietude." This does not appear to have been the only "Skimmington-riding " that took place in the county that year, for in the *Dorset County Chronicle* (1884) appeared an account of certain proceedings for assault taken by one woman against another at Okeford Fitzpaine. The proceedings arose out of certain circumstances which had occasioned a "Skimmington-riding" in the parish, and that not for the first time, the evidence revealing, as the Chairman said, a very discreditable state of things in the village. `[If anyone is desirous of seeing the full particulars of this case they will be found in the second volume of some printed folk-lore and antiquarian newspaper cuttings, compiled by myself and now lent to the Dorset County Museum Library at Dorchester. Also for an account of a similar kind of thing which happened at Hope Square, Weymouth, somewhere about the same time (if I remember rightly) I would refer to the same volume of "Dorset Collections."]` Probably few of my readers will need to be reminded of the dramatic description of a "Skimmington-riding" given by Mr. Thomas Hardy, in chap. xvi. of the second volume of his Dorset novel, *The Mayor of Casterbridge*, published in 1886, and the tragic effect which that coarsely humorous spectacle (the scene of which was laid but a few yards from the building wherein we are now assembled) had upon the unfortunate woman whose supposed laxity of conduct had afforded the excuse for the exhibition. In conclusion, let me say, that much as we may regret the unfortunate result pourtrayed by Mr. Hardy in this instance, yet it would be well if no worse effects ever followed on the observance of ancient customs in other countries than those usually to be attributed to the salutary discipline of a Dorsetshire "Skimmington-riding."

Highbridge Petty Sessions

MONDAY.— Before Messrs. G. B. Sully and A. G. Pitts.

SKIMMERTON RIDING

Alice Ellis and Susan Mears, married women, and Blanche Lane, single woman, all of Highbridge, were charged with committing an assault upon Jane Pitman, married woman, of Burnham, on February 6th. —Mr F W Bishop appeared for the defence, and defendants pleaded not guilty. —Jane Pitman, wife of James Pitman, stated that at 3.30 pm on February 8th she went into the Lamb Inn, Highbridge, and waited for her daughter, Edith Pitman. The women followed her daughter back to the Lamb and came inside, when they commenced "becalling" her. They said "We've got you now," and had a rope in their hands. The landlord ordered them outside, and when she went outside Mrs Ellis and Mrs Mears put the rope round her waist. The defendants then dragged her with the rope to Newtown, from thence back to Church street and on to Burnham by the road, through Abingdon-street, Burnham, to the Esplanade, Adam-street and Alfred-street. At Berryman's Commercial Hotel they had some beer, and there was a great crowd assembled. Complainant did not have any of the beer. Then she was dragged through Alfred-street to the Lifeboat, where defendants pulled her down in the road. She got up, and they dragged her on through Princess-street and Oxford-street to the Ring of Bells, and there they had more beer. There was a crowd of people following all the time. They went on through Cross-street, Alfred-street again, and Victoria-street as far as the church, through Princess-street where someone threw soot and flour. The crowd was throwing mud and dirt nearly all the time. Then defendants took her to her house in Oxford-street, where they took off the rope and beat and pushed her about before she was able to go into her house. The crowd remained round the house until P.C. Butt came and dispersed them.— By Mr Bishop: These were the only three women who had to do with putting the rope on her. The disturbance was because she went to look fter a woman that died. Her husband was not disturbed because of her doing so. Her husband was with the crowd looking on at the Ring of Bells. She did not know that whatever was done was at the special request of her husband, and if there was anything between her and her husband, it was a matter between themselves. She was now living at Wells and not with her husband. When she came out of the Lamb Inn a good many did not assist at putting the rope on her— only the three defendants. She did not then say, "You can do what you like with me, as I don't care if you take me through all the streets and to Burnham." It was not a fact that she fell own herself on seeing her husband coming, but the three defendants pulled her down. She had not been living with her husband since the day in question. —Edith Pitman, daughter of complainant, corroborated her mother's evidence. She was living with her mother at Wells, and had not been back with her father since. The women beat her as well, which she supposed was owing to her sticking to her mother. —The complainant did not think it necessary to call P.C. Butt, and that completed her case. —For the defence Mr Bishop commented upon the policeman not being called. There were occasions when matters occur in villages which are not in accordance with general ideas of the way society should be conducted, when public indignation arises and bursts the bonds of order. The three defendants, with a large number of others, fancied this lady had not been behaving as she should do, and it was at the request of her husband this was done at all. Further, she said she would be pleased to walk through the streets of Highbridge and Burnham. It seemed absurd to think the woman could be dragged as she had described without visible marks of injury. He should also prove there was no beating or striking from start to return. —Alice Ellis, sworn, said a lot of people assembled outside the Lamb Inn in consequence of what Mrs Pitman's husband told them to do. She did not put the rope round Mrs Pitman. She heard Mrs Pitman say she would go where they liked, as she was not ashamed. Neither witness or the defendants ever struck Mrs Pitman. It was Mrs Pitman's husband who paid for the beer at Berryman's and the Ring of Bells. —Cross-examined: She admitted holding one end of the rope. —Susan Mears, sworn, said that all Mrs Ellis's evidence was quite true. She did not herself strike Mrs Pitman or pull her down. She also held one end of the rope. —Blanche Lane, also sworn, corroborated the evidence of the two other defendants, and admitted holding the rope. —Mrs Mary Ann Baker, Newtown, deposed to hearing Mrs Pitman say, outside the Lamb Inn, they could do what they liked with her, and if they took her through the streets she did mot care. She said the same in Newtown, and also asked to be taken to Mr Clist's.— William Lyddon said he saw Mrs Pitman turned out of the Lamb, but did not hear anything she said. She was not dragged but appeared to walk along quite easily. He followed the procession to Burnham and did not see any assault or beating when they went down to the house.—John Pitman, son of the plaintiff, was called as a witness for the defence, but Mr Bishop decided not to examine him on account of the relationship of the parties.—The Bench conferred, and at length signified that the assault had been proved; that the defence set up was nothing in mitigation; and that the Bench must do what lay in its power to prevent people thinking they could thus take the law into their own hands. The fine would be 10s. and costs, in default seven days.

Susan Mears, one of the defendants in the last case was also charged with using profane language at 11 30 p.m. on February 6th (the same date as the assault). P.S. Bartlett detailed the language use by defendant when walking home between her husband and Blanche Lane, and that disorder continued till nearly one a.m., at Victoria-street, Newton. — Blanche Lane and Lucy Fear gave evidence for the defence, but the Bench fined Mrs Mears 2s. 6d. and costs.

EXETER POLICE.

GUILDHALL, SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 9.

Skimmington Riding.—Every Devonian what a skimmington march is. As our paper is filed at the *British Museum*, for the especial enlightenment of future generations, from Queen Victoria's great grandson, even to the verge of the long vista of sovereigns which our prophetic eye traces out, as the extent of her race —we, having an eye to posterity, shall describe it at sufficient length to enable respectable antiquarian chroniclers of the future olden times to understand all its technicalities.

In all ages and climes the condition of wedlock has ever been fenced round with certain privileges and distinctions. A breach of that sacred condition, or infringement of its rites, has invariably entailed on the culprit condign punishment or death. The laws of barbarous people generally inflict summary chastisement if not actual execution: the most refined are content with a simple action for damages, and as much money as the matter injured was supposed to be worth in a sound state. In England fashionable people go to law, and unfashionable people to loggerheads. But this is not skimmington riding. Well, then, here it is. In Devonshire, when a couple, not married to each other, but belonging to the married portion of the community are caught in *flagrante delicto*, the virtuous neighbours, in order to avenge the wounded honour of the respective sufferers, attached to the delinquents, get two persons dressed to imitate the garb of the wicked ones, and mounting them back to back on one donkey, parade them through the neighbourhood which has been shocked by the discovery of such unusual wickedness. The neighbours all open their doors and windows—jealous wives bring out their husbands by way of premonitory caution, and suspected wives are reminded that "if every woman as deserved that 'ere sort of elevation was mounted on donkey's back, Jerusalem ponies would be better occupied than in carrying greens." The "riding" is accompanied by a band of rough music—the swain is decorated with a pair of gilt ram's horns, and the cap of the faithless fair one is bedight with a goodly bunch carrots. As they proceed along they are admonished by the elders of the neighbourhood against their faithless wickedness—the matrons advising the male delinquent, and the fathers rebuking the lady. After the tour of the whole neighbourhood has been completed, the criminals are brought back to the scene of their guilt, and the young people of the district solemnly instructed as to the nature of the offence, are duly admonished of the consequence; and Mr. Ram and Mrs. Carrots are both dismissed to their several homes to receive that domestic retribution, which if it will not cure the sinner, he may be safely pronounced incorrigible. ...

Exeter and Plymouth Gazette - Saturday 18 July 1835

Our worthy friends, "The Grecians," of the famed "parish" of St. Sidwells, who are not often behind-hand in forwarding a lark, on Friday last got up a good practical joke on two Benedicts, who were supposed to have offended against the laws of conjugal fidelity;— indeed they revived the old and now nearly obsolete practice of "Skimmington," which was in vogue in less refined times, as a mode of punishing, or holding up to contempt, without having recourse to law, those guilty of such immoral offences. A procession was accordingly formed in the foliowing order:—A number of lads with their faces blackened, performing most humorous choruses on old tin kettles; a man with a black face, carrying a pole, on the top of which was placed a large pair of rams' horns, suitably painted and ornamented; then followed a donkey, (always a prominent character in those cavalcades) led by a man with a black face, there being mounted on the animal two men, one attired in the garb of the fair sex, for the purpose of representing the parties chargd with the offence; a rabble of men and boys brought up the rear. and as the pair on the donkey acted a battle at intervals, the crowd set up sundry jeers, groans, and howlings, which, together with the music from the tin kettles, produced an effect beyond our powers of description. Having paraded a certain neighbourhood, and continued this farce for about half-an-hour, the procession broke up, in good order, luckily escaping the police.

Wiliam Elliott, George Ryman, Henry Ridout, Charles Thorne, James Stevens, John Shergold, Frederick Frampton, George Brewer, William Wicks, Jasper Weeks, Levi Lane, and James Read, all of Handley, were summoned by the police, for wilfully obstructing the highway at the same place on the 28th ult., and for committing a breach of the peace. Mr. Atkinson appeared for the defendants. The Deputy Chief Constable said he should be able to prove that the defendants with divers other persons, assembled on the highway, for the purpose of carrying out the silly practice of what was commonly called "skimmington riding," and the object of bringing them before the Bench, was to prevent a repetition, which might lead to a serious breach of the peace. Mr. Atkinson said in order to save the time of the Bench, the first 10 defendants would plead guilty, and as there seemed to be some mistakes with regard to Lane and Read, they were allowed to go quiet, the other defendants were severely cautioned, and fined 6d. each, and the costs 2s. 4d. each, amounting in the whole to £1 8s 4d.

Western Gazette - Saturday 14 November 1863

County Police, November 5.—(Before John Hussey. Esq.)— George Bastable and Luke Ayles, of Marnhull, were summoned at the instance of Superintendent Hammond, for committing a breach of the public peace, at Marnhull, on the evening of the 27th ult. It appeared from the evidence of Police-constable Freeman, that the defendants were at the head of large mob, who had turned out for the purpose performing that silly and disgraceful practice called "skimmington riding," and noise and uproar continued in the street for upwards of an hour. The defendants were unable to make any defence, and magistrates called upon them to enter into their own recognizances in £5, to keep the peace for six months.

SOME MARRIAGE CUSTOMS OF THE BRITISH ISLES.

Hogarth, in his delineation of the "Marriage of the industrious apprentice to his master's daughter," has introduced a set of butchers with marrow bones and cleavers who have pushed aside the legitimate musicians. The custom in question was an old institution of London, and essentially connected with the marriage ceremony. A set of butchers' men having armed themselves with cleavers and marrow bones, assembled in front of the house containing the married party and performed a sort of rude serenade in the expectation of a fee of requital for their music. The cleavers were generally ground to produce a certain note, and a band of eight produced a complete octave. When fair skill was shown this series of notes would have as fine effect as a peal of bells. The performers were generally neatly dressed in blue sleeves and aprons, each with a portentous wedding favour of white paper in his breast or hat. A merry, roogh affair it was, and not always relished by the party in whose honour it was designed, and sometimes when a band of musicians came upon the scene at the same time, or a party of youngsters would interfere with pebbles rattling in tin cannisters, thus throwing a sort of burlesque on the performance, a few blows would sometimes be interchanged. Yet marrow bones and cleavers seldom failed to diffuse good humour throughont the peighbourhood. The custom is still kept up at a butcher's marriage.

In Lincolnshire rantanning used to be in force. Whenever a wife had beaten her husband a geenral assembly took place, of roughs with bones and cleavers, tin-cans and sticks, pokers and shovels, and amidst the general din occasioned by these instruments they sang the following doggrel:—

Ran-tan. the old tin can,  
Mrs. Brassy-faced woman has beaten her man.

When the husband had beaten his wife it was customary to procure and old saddle crupper, to tie up some straw in it, and fasten it to the door or window of the offenders dwelling. The custom of rantanning used also to prevail in the West Riding of Yorkshire and some parts of Lancashire. It was customary in Lancashire, when lovers were caught courting on a Friday night, for their neighbours to turn out with frying pans, on which they performed with rolling pins, whilst the abashed lovers slunk away. The custom was evidently to remind the female that Friday was "cleaning up" night. Rantanning was also used when a man or woman was supposed to be unfaithful, and the straw effigy of the offender, seated on a pole, was carried about the streets. The custom of rantanning was also in vogue in Berkshire and Wiltshire under the name of "rough musicing." In Dorsetshire it is called stanging, or skimmington riding. Two men, personating a quarrelsome couple, and seated on a ladder, are borne on the shoulders of five or six of the crowd, amid the rattliog of tin kettles, before the house of some peace-breaking couple, where a mimic quarrel of the unhappy pair is rehearsed for the edification of the crowd.

In the year 1600 the Court Leet of Manchester passed a law that no minstrel should play within the town at weddings, that did not belong to the waits of the town, under a penalty of 3s. 3d.; and thirty-seven years before this it ordered that no person should pay above fourpence at any wedding dinner, under a penalty of 6s. 3d.

SOME OLD LANARKSHIRE CUSTOMS.

No. II.

...

... Forsyth in his "Beauties of Scotland," published in 1805, alludes to a certain ancient custom as being occasionally practised at Biggar about his time. This was *Ridinq the stang*, corresponding in purpose to the Skimmington riding in the southern counties of Eogland. The object of both practices was to bring discredit on those who had made themselves obnoxious to the community. Riding the stang was indeed a kind of lynching. When a man acquired the reputation of maltreating his wife, the females of the place, in their indignation, took the law into their own hands. Forsyth thus describes the practice:-"All the women enter into a conspiracy to execute vengeance upon the culprit. Having fixed upon the time when their design is to be put into effect, they suddenly assemble in a great crowd, and seize the offending party. They take care at the same time to provide a stout beam of wood, upon which they set him astride, and, hoisting him aloft, tie his legs beneath. He is thus carried in derision round the village, attended by the hootings, scoffs, and hisses of his numerous attendants, who pull down his legs, so as to render his seat in other respects abundantly uneasy."

In some parts of the country the offender was punished vicariously, another person representing him being made to ride the stang. In this case the name of the real offender was proclaimed, in order that the public indignation might be directed to the proper quarter. Though Forsyth does not say so, this riding the stang for another may have been occasionally practiced at Biggar. The doctrine that the offence should be punished in the person of the offeder seems however to have been usually acted upon. Andrews in his recently published "Old Time Punishments," mentions that the inhabitants of Northallerton, in Yorkshire, had recourse to the ceremony as late as 1887. In Wales the custom was called *Riding the ceffyl press*, i.e. wooden horse. It has been revived in the Principality within recent years. ...

RIDING THE STANG.

AN OLD YORKSHIRE CUSTOM.

The ancient custom of riding the stang still lingers in some of the remote parts of Yorkshire. Holding delinquents up to ridicule was a favourite mode of punishment practised by our forefathers, and riding the stang was the means generally employed for punishing husbands who beat their wives, or allowed themselves to be henpecked, or if their conduct was profligate or licentious. There are various designations for the custom:— In our own county riding the stang is the name used; in Scotland the same term is applied; in the south of England skimmington riding is the title generally employed, on the Continent it is known by other appellations.

The mode of carrying out the ceremony is as follows:— A man, having beaten his wife, the young men of the assume the attitude of public censors, arrangements are made for riding the stang three nights in succession. A trumpeter blows his horn loud and long as day gives way to night, and the viilagers are brought together. A pole or a ladder is procured, and the most witty man of the village is placed thereon, mounted shoulder high, and carried in great state through the streets. In one hand he has a large key or stick, and in the other a dripping-pan, and leads the music of the crowd, Men, women, and children join in the fun, and beat kettles, pans, pots, or anything else that will make a noise, tin whistles, horns and trumpets are blown, the noise produced being better imagined than described. As soon as all is ready a start is made, and about every fifty yards the procession stops, and the mounted man proclaims at the top of his voice a rhyme suited to the nature of the offence, somewhat as under:— 

Ran, tan, tan; ran, tan, tan,  
To the sound of this pan; 
This is to give notice that Tom Trotter  
Has beaten his good wo-man!  
For what, and for why?  
'Cause she ate when she was hungry,  
And drank when she was dry.  
Ran, tan, ran, tan, tan;  
Hurrah—hurrah! for this good wo-man!  
He beat her, he beat her, he beat her indeed,  
For spending a penny when she had need.  
He beat her black, he beat her blue;  
When Old Nick gets him, he'll give him his due;  
Ran, tan, tan; ran, tan, tan;  
We'll send him there in this old frying-pan;  
Hurrah—hurrah! for his good wo-man!  

Here is another version of the rhyme jotted down in upper Wharfedale:—

Heigh dilly, how dilly, heigh dilly dang.  
It's naether for thy part nor my part  
That I ride the stang,  
But it is for Jack Solomon  
His wife he does bang;  
He bang'd her, he bang'd her,  
He bang'd her indeed;  
He bang'd t' poor woman,  
Though shoo stood him na need,  
He naether tuke stick, staen, wire, nor stower,  
But he up wi' a besom and knocked her ower,  
So all ye good nahbers, who live in this row,  
I pray ye tak warning for this is our law;  
And all ye cross husbands Who do your wives bang,  
We'll blow for ye t' horn,  
And ride for ye t' stang,  
Hip, hip, hip, hurrah.

The house of the culprit is visited several times each night, and the proceedings kept up three nights in succession, and a circuit of the church is also made, as it is believed that those taking part in the ceremony will not be amenable to the law. If the offence is a very serious one, the offender is burnt in effigy before his own door. In the olden days, the culprit himself was often compelled to ride the stang.

Several of the old poets refer to this ancient usage. Allan Ramsay, in his poems published in 1721, says:—

They frae a barn a kaber raught  
Ane mounted wi' a bang,  
Betwisht twa's shoulders, and sat straught  
Upon't, and *rade the stang*  
*On her* that day.

Mr George Roberts, of Lyme Regis, forwarded to Sir Walter Scett some interesting notes on skimmington riding. He wrote Sir Walter, that in the south of England— "About dusk two individuals, one armed with a skimmer and the other with a ladle, come out of some obscure street attended by a crowd, whose laughter, huzzas, &c., emulate the weil-known *charivari* of the French. The two performers are sometimes in a cart, at other times on a donkey; one personating the wife, the other the husband. They beat each other furiously with the culinary weapons above described, and, warmed by the applause and presence of so many spectators (for all turn out to see a skimmington), their dialogue attains a freedom, except using surnames, only comparable with their gestures. On arriving at the house of the parties represented in this moviog drama, animation is at its height: the crowd usually stay at the spot some minutes, and then traverse the town. The performers are remunerated by the spectators: the parties who parade the streets with the performers sweep with brooms the doors of those who are likely to require a similar visitation."

In Butler's "Hudibras" considerable attention is paid to the custom. We conclude with a few of his lines:—

And now the cause of all their fear  
By slow degrees approached so near,  
Of horns, and pans, and dogs, and boys,  
And kettle-drums, whose sullen dub  
Sounds like the hooping of a tub; . . .  
And followed with a world of tall-lads,  
That merry ditties troll'd, and ballads. . . .  
Next pans and kettles of all keys,  
From trebles dows todouble base: . . .  
And at fit periods the whole route  
Set up their throats with clamorous shout.
