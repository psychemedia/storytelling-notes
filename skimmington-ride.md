Dorsetshire Birth, Death, and Marriage Customs and Superstitions

by J. S. Udal, F. R. Hist. Soc.

pp.182-200 and in particular, under *Marriage Customs*, at pp. 194-200

(viii.) Skimmington Riding. — No account of Dorsetshire customs connected with marriages would be complete without some reference to a "Skimmington," or, as it is sometimes called, a "Skimmity Riding," which is a kind of matrimonial lynch law or pillory intended for those in a lower class of life, who, in certain glaring particulars, may have transgressed their marital duties, and have thus brought upon themselves this, the strongest expression of outraged public opinion that a country district is capable of conveying. There is such an excellent and full description, both as to what a "Skimmington riding" is, and of the causes for which it takes place, given in Roberts' *History of Lyme Regis*, published in 1834, that I cannot do Letter than quote it in full here:— "Skimmington riding still continues to hold its ground. In an account I gave of it to the late Sir Walter Scott in 1828 is the information contained in this narrative. Skimmington riding is a great moral agent, not perhaps so much in restraining the vicious as in causing them to shun public observation, thereby not holding out bad examples to the rising youth of both sexes; in a word, it checks those instances of openly profligate and licentious conduct, which else might become too prevalent among the lower orders, who cannot, like their superiors, have recourse to legal proceedings against the person who has injured them, or divorce; it brands with infamy all gross instances of licentiousness, and exposes to lasting ridicule those couples who by their dissensions disturb the quiet and order of the neighbourhood, and so set a bad example either by struggling for domestic ascendancy, or by their quarrelsome dispositions. A Skimmington riding makes many laugh; but the parties for whom they ride never lose the ridicule and disgrace which it attaches. So far, it is a punishment, like the visit of Mumbo Jumbo in Africa. `[The value of Mr. Roberts' allusion to Mumbo Jumbo may not be thoroughly appreciated by all my readers, for only recently in *Notes and Queries* a discussion has arisen as to whether Dickens (who, it appears from Forster's *Life*, vol. ii., p. 409, had accused Carlyle of ignorance upon this point) himself understood who or what Mumbo Jumbo really was. By a very curious conicidence, on the evening of the very clay upon which I had penned the above lines taken from the *History of Lyme Regis* I happened to be reading the last number of *Notes and Queries*, sent out to me from England, and in that very number (July 30th, 1892, 8th Series, ii., 95) occurred the solution of this very question, taken from Mungo Park's *Travels in the Interior of Africa* (1799), which work is quoted upon this point, I believe, in Brand's *Popular Antiquities*, and where in all probability Roberts, if, indeed, he had not seen the original *Travels*, obtained his reference. There are two accounts given in the above number of *N. & Q.*, and as they appear to me so very interesting as affording something very like an African prototype of on* Dorset "Skimmington" I make no apology for reproducing a portion of the shorter of them herein the shape of a note :— " As the Kaffirs are not restricted in the number of their wives, every one marries as many as he can conveniently maintain ; and as it frequently happens that the ladies do not agree among themselves, family quarrels sometimes rise to such a height that the authority of the husband can no longer preserve peace in his household. In such cases the interposition of Mumbo Jumbo is called in, and is always decisive. This strange minister of justice (who is supposed to be either the husband himself or some person instructed by him) disguised in the dress that has been mentioned, and armed witli the rod of public authority, announces his coming by loud and dismal screams in the woods near the town. He begins the pantomime at the approach of night, and as soon as it is dark he enters the town. The ceremony commences with songs and dances, which continue till midnight, about which time Mumbo fixes on the offender. The unfortunate victim being seized, is stripped, tied to a post, and severely scourged with Mumbo's rod, amidst the shouts and derision of the whole assembly. Daylight puts an end to the unseemly revel."]` The following are the principal causes for riding the Skimmington:— (i.) When a man and his wife quarrel and he gives up to her. (ii.) When a woman is unfaithful to her husband, and he patiently submits without resenting her conduct, (iii.) Any grossly licentious conduct on the part of married persons. The first cause appears to answer that recorded in *Hudibras*, canto ii., line 685. The knight having mistaken a Skimmington for some other procession, is undeceived as follows:—

"Quoth Kalpho, "You mistake, the matter,  
For all th' antiquity you smatter,  
*Is but a riding used, of course,*  
*When the grey mare's the better horse.*  
When o'er the breeches greedy women  
Fight to extend their vast dominion,  
And in the cause impatient Grizzle  
Has drubbed her husband with ————  
And brought him under covert baron  
To turn her vassail with a murrain.  
. . . . .  
And they in mortal battle vanquished  
Are of their charter disenfranchised."

About dusk two individuals come out of some obscure street, attended by a crowd, whose laughter, huzzas &c, emulate the well-known Charivari of the French. The two performers are sometimes in a cart, at other times on a donkey, one personating the wife, the other the husband. They beat each other furiously with the culinary weapons above described, and, warmed by the applause and presence of so many spectators (for all turn out to see a Skimmington), their dialogue attains a freedom, except in using surnames, only comparable with their gestures. On arriving at the house of the parties represented in this moving drama, animation is at its height, the crowd usually stay at that spot some minutes, and then traverse the town. The performers are remunerated by the spectators ; the parties that parade the streets with the performers sweep with besoms the doors of those who are likely to require a similar visitation. See Dr. King's *Miscellany*:

"When the young people ride the Skimmington  
There is a general trembling in the town;  
Not only her for whom the party rides Suffers,  
but they sweep other doors besides.  
And by that hieroglyphic does appear  
That the good woman is the master there."

Mr. Douce derives Skimmington from the skimming-ladle used in the procession. Mr. Brand says "None of the commentators on *Hudibras* have attempted an elucidation of the ceremony. Hogarth has illustrated it." Mr. Eoberts's account drew from the great "Wizard of the North " a very interesting reply, and as it gives a variant of the custom as obtaining in Scotland, and moreover Sir Walter Scott's letter may not have been otherwise published or known to my readers, I give it here:— " We had, or perhaps I might say still have, a similar ritual of popular interference in Scotland, in case of gross scandal or nuptial transgressions and public quarrels in a household. It is called 'riding the stang,' the peccant party being seated across a pole (or stang) in no very comfortable position. You will find some notice of the custom in Jamieson's *Scottish Dictionary*, *voce* Stang. I think the Doctor does not mention that men and women also were sometimes exposed to ride the stang on account of incontinence. Burns made some clever verses (not in his collected works) on a comrade of his who had been- accessory to such a Saturnalian scene of punishment, in which the exposed female had suffered bodily injury, upon which account the regular police had looked after the parties who had interfered with their regular vocation. I have read in Brand's *Popular Antiquities*, or some such authority, that scholars in the English Universities were subjected to the stang when they neglect ~ prayers. You will find a poem on the Skimmington among Prior's poems, not the folio edition, where it is omitted, but in the large collection. When they rode the Skimmington, it would seem they swept the doors of those whom they threatened with similar discipline." It will be noticed here that "Riding the Stang " approaches more nearly to the African ceremony of *Mumbo Jumbo* wherein the "peccant party" takes an active — or perhaps I should rather say a passive — part in the performance; whereas in a "Skimmington-riding" the punishment, in its physical effects at all events, is vicarious, and the whole ceremony is in character an effigy. Mr. Roberts states that in 1828 "skimming-riding" still continued to hold its ground. The lapse of another half century, with its increased enlightenment and education amongst the masses, leaves us in the same position, so far as Dorsetshire is concerned, if we believe the account given in the *Bridport News* in November, 1884, of a "skimmerton-riding" (as it is there called) that had recently occurred in the parish of Whitechurch Canonicorum in West Dorset, which is interesting as shewing us what changes (if any) have been wrought by that half century in the character of the performance. The extract is as follows: "On Wednesday, the 5th inst., this usually quiet parish was in a state of some excitement, owing to a demonstration of a peculiar character, not immediately connected with the day, which, however, was selected for the purpose by the superior judgment of the promoters. About six o'clock in the evening, just as darkness began to reign, a strange noise was heard, as of the sound of trays and kettles, and it was soon found that a 'skimmerton-riding' was in progress, such a thing not having been known for years in this parish. Three grotesquely-attired figures were to be seen escorted by a procession consisting of persons dressed in various queer and eccentric costumes, and who paraded the parish, also visiting Morcombelake and Ryal. The figures alluded to appeared to the villagers to represent three personages who were very well known to 'them, there being a male and two females, whose past conduct had caused them to be made the subject of this queer exhibition. The two female characters were conveyed about on the backs of what are described as 'celebrated Jerusalems,' which certainly seemed pretty well to enter into the joke, for one of them particularly displayed his innate agility in a surprising manner. One of the females was represented as having an extraordinary long tongue, which was tied back to the neck, whilst in one hand she held some note-paper, and in the other pen and holder. Those forming the procession were literally 'wetted' at the various inns, and after their perambulations were concluded they repaired to a certain field where a gallows was erected, and on which the effigies were hung and afterwards burnt, having previously been well saturated with some highly inflammable liquid. Nearly two hundred people assembled in the field, and a flaming light was maintained by torches. The extraordinary proceedings terminated with a fight, in which black eyes and bloody noses were not absent. However, the Riot Act was not read, the military was not called out, and the crowd dispersed about midnight, when the village resumed its wonted quietude." This does not appear to have been the only "Skimmington-riding " that took place in the county that year, for in the *Dorset County Chronicle* (1884) appeared an account of certain proceedings for assault taken by one woman against another at Okeford Fitzpaine. The proceedings arose out of certain circumstances which had occasioned a "Skimmington-riding" in the parish, and that not for the first time, the evidence revealing, as the Chairman said, a very discreditable state of things in the village. `[If anyone is desirous of seeing the full particulars of this case they will be found in the second volume of some printed folk-lore and antiquarian newspaper cuttings, compiled by myself and now lent to the Dorset County Museum Library at Dorchester. Also for an account of a similar kind of thing which happened at Hope Square, Weymouth, somewhere about the same time (if I remember righly) I would refer to the same volume of "Dorset Collections."]` Probably few of my readers will need to be reminded of the dramatic description of a "Skimmington-riding" given by Mr. Thomas Hardy, in chap. xvi. of the second volume of his Dorset novel, *The Mayor of Casterbridge*, published in 1886, and the tragic effect which that coarsely humorous spectacle (the scene of which was laid but a few yards from the building wherein we are now assembled) had upon the unfortunate woman whose supposed laxity of conduct had afforded the excuse for the exhibition. In conclusion, let me say, that much as we may regret the unfortunate result pourtrayed by Mr. Hardy in this instance, yet it would be well if no worse effects ever followed on the observance of ancient customs in other countries than those usually to be attributed to the salutary discipline of a Dorsetshire "Skimmington-riding."

Highbridge Petty Sessions

MONDAY.— Before Messrs. G. B. Sully and A. G. Pitts.

SKIMMERTON RIDING

Alice Ellis and Susan Mears, married women, and Blanche Lane, single woman, all of Highbridge, were charged with committing an assault upon Jane Pitman, married woman, of Burnham, on February 6th. —Mr F W Bishop appeared for the defence, and defendants pleaded not guilty. —Jane Pitman, wife of James Pitman, stated that at 3.30 pm on February 8th she went into the Lamb Inn, Highbridge, and waited for her daughter, Edith Pitman. The women followed her daughter back to the Lamb and came inside, when they commenced "becalling" her. They said "We've got you now," and had a rope in their hands. The landlord ordered them outside, and when she went outside Mrs Ellis and Mrs Mears put the rope round her waist. The defendants then dragged her with the rope to Newtown, from thence back to Church street and on to Burnham by the road, through Abingdon-street, Burnham, to the Esplanade, Adam-street and Alfred-street. At Berryman's Commercial Hotel they had some beer, and there was a great crowd assembled. Complainant did not have any of the beer. Then she was dragged through Alfred-street to the Lifeboat, where defendants pulled her down in the road. She got up, and they dragged her on through Princess-street and Oxford-street to the Ring of Bells, and there they had more beer. There was a crowd of people following all the time. They went on through Cross-street, Alfred-street again, and Victoria-street as far as the church, through Princess-street where someone threw soot and flour. The crowd was throwing mud and dirt nearly all the time. Then defendants took her to her house in Oxford-street, where they took off the rope and beat and pushed her about before she was able to go into her house. The crowd remained round the house until P.C. Butt came and dispersed them.— By Mr Bishop: These were the only three women who had to do with putting the rope on her. The disturbance was because she went to look fter a woman that died. Her husband was not disturbed because of her doing so. Her husband was with the crowd looking on at the Ring of Bells. She did not know that whatever was done was at the special request of her husband, and if there was anything between her and her husband, it was a matter between themselves. She was now living at Wells and not with her husband. When she came out of the Lamb Inn a good many did not assist at putting the rope on her— only the three defendants. She did not then say, "You can do what you like with me, as I don't care if you take me through all the streets and to Burnham." It was not a fact that she fell own herself on seeing her husband coming, but the three defendants pulled her down. She had not been living with her husband since the day in question. —Edith Pitman, daughter of complainant, corroborated her mother's evidence. She was living with her mother at Wells, and had not been back with her father since. The women beat her as well, which she supposed was owing to her sticking to her mother. —The complainant did not think it necessary to call P.C. Butt, and that completed her case. —For the defence Mr Bishop commented upon the policeman not being called. There were occasions when matters occur in villages which are not in accordance with general ideas of the way society should be conducted, when public indignation arises and bursts the bonds of order. The three defendants, with a large number of others, fancied this lady had not been behaving as she should do, and it was at the request of her husband this was done at all. Further, she said she would be pleased to walk through the streets of Highbridge and Burnham. It seemed absurd to think the woman could be dragged as she had described without visible marks of injury. He should also prove there was no beating or striking from start to return. —Alice Ellis, sworn, said a lot of people assembled outside the Lamb Inn in consequence of what Mrs Pitman's husband told them to do. She did not put the rope round Mrs Pitman. She heard Mrs Pitman say she would go where they liked, as she was not ashamed. Neither witness or the defendants ever struck Mrs Pitman. It was Mrs Pitman's husband who paid for the beer at Berryman's and the Ring of Bells. —Cross-examined: She admitted holding one end of the rope. —Susan Mears, sworn, said that all Mrs Ellis's evidence was quite true. She did not herself strike Mrs Pitman or pull her down. She also held one end of the rope. —Blanche Lane, also sworn, corroborated the evidence of the two other defendants, and admitted holding the rope. —Mrs Mary Ann Baker, Newtown, deposed to hearing Mrs Pitman say, outside the Lamb Inn, they could do what they liked with her, and if they took her through the streets she did mot care. She said the same in Newtown, and also asked to be taken to Mr Clist's.— William Lyddon said he saw Mrs Pitman turned out of the Lamb, but did not hear anythig she said. She was not dragged but appeared to walk along quite easily. He followed the procession to Burnham and did not see any assault or beating when they went down to the house.—John Pitman, son of the plaintiff, was called as a witness for the defence, but Mr Bishop decided not to examine him on account of the relationship of the parties.—The Bench conferred, and at length signified that the assault had been proved; that the defence set up was nothing in mitigation; and that the Bench must do what lay in its power to prevent people thinking they could thus take the law into their own hands. The fine would be 10s. and costs, in default seven days.

Susan Mears, one of the defendants in the last case was also charged with using profane language at 11 30 p.m. on February 6th (the same date as the assault). P.S. Bartlett detailed the language use by defendant when walking home between her husband and Blanche Lane, and that disorder continued till nearly one a.m., at Victoria-street, Newton. — Blanche Lane and Lucy Fear gave evidence for the defence, but the Bench fined Mrs Mears 2s. 6d. and costs.
