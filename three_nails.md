Du Cange's last passage is by far the most interesting:— ' Anonymus de Passione Domini: " And when they arrive at the place, the komodromos coming to crucify him," etc.' Nalls of ' Why so interesting ? there does not seem much in Crucifixion, that,' my readers may exclaim. Why ? because there is a widely- spread superstition that a Gypsy forged the nails for the crucifixion, and that henceforth his race has been accursed of heaven. That superstition was first recorded in an article by Dr. B. Bogisic on 'Die slavisirten Zigeuner in Montenegro' ( Das Ausland, 25th May 1874); and in Le Folklore de Lesbos , by G. Georgeakis and Leon Pineau (Paris, 1891, pp. 273-8), is this 'Chant du Vendredi Saint,' this plaint of Our Lady :—
INTRODUCTION

For Du Cange's first three quotations I can assign no dates, but Theophanes Isaurus was born in 758 and died in 818; the seven¬ teenth year of Justinian would be 544 a.d. —a very early date at which to find a Gypsy from Italy, ' having with him a blind yellow dog.' The dates of the Emperor Constantinus Porphyrogenitus are 905-959; I own I can make little of this passage from his Liber de adminisirando Lmperio, but themu, bandon, topoteresia, and tourma seem all to be words for administrative divisions.

Du Cange's last passage is by far the most interesting:— ' Anonymus de Passione Domini: " And when they arrive at the place, the komodromos coming to crucify him," etc.' Nalls of ' Why so interesting ? there does not seem much in Crucifixion, that,' my readers may exclaim. Why ? because there is a widely- spread superstition that a Gypsy forged the nails for the crucifixion, and that henceforth his race has been accursed of heaven. That superstition was first recorded in an article by Dr. B. Bogisic on 'Die slavisirten Zigeuner in Montenegro' ( Das Ausland, 25th May 1874); and in Le Folklore de Lesbos , by G. Georgeakis and Leon Pineau (Paris, 1891, pp. 273-8), is this 'Chant du Vendredi Saint,' this plaint of Our Lady :—
' Our Lady was in a grotto And made her prayer.
She hears rolling of thunder,
She sees lightnings,
She hears a great noise.
She goes to the window :
She sees the heaven all black And the stars veiled :
The bright moon was bathed in blood.
She looks to right, she looks to left:
She perceives St. John ;
She sees John coming In tears and dejection :
He holds a handkerchief spotted with blood.
"Good-day, John. Wherefore These tears and this dejection ?
Has thy Master beaten thee,
Or hast thou lost the Psalter?"
" The Master has not beaten me,
And I have not lost the Psalter.
I have no mouth to tell it thee,
Nor tongue to speak to thee :
And thine heart will be unable to hear me.
These miserable Jews have arrested my Master,
They have arrested him like a thief,
And they are leading him away like a murderer."

Our Lady, when she heard it,
Fell and swooned.
They sprinkle her from a pitcher of water,
From three bottles of musk,
And from four bottles of rose-water,
Until she comes to herself.
When she was come to herself, she says,
" All you who love Christ and adore him,
Come with me to find him,
Before they kill him,
And before they nail him,
And before they put him to death.
Let Martha, Magdalene, and Mary come,
And the mother of the Forerunner."
These words were still on her lips,
Lo ! five thousand marching in front,
And four thousand following after.
They take the road, the path of the Jews.
No one went near the Jews except the unhappy mother. The path led them in front of the door of a nail-maker. She finds the nail-maker with his children,
The nail-maker with his wife.
" Good-day, workman, what art making there ? "
"The Jews have ordered nails of me ;
They have Ordered four of me ;
But I, 1 am making them five."
"Tell me, tell me, workman.
What they will do with them."
"They will put two nails in his feet,
Two others in his hands ;
And the other, the sharpest.
Will pierce his lung."

Gypsy Lore Journal (iii. 1892, p. 190), is this brief unsigned note : * I should be pleased to know if you have the tradition in the South [of Scotland], that the tinkers are descendants of the one who made the nails for the Cross, and are condemned to wander continually without rest.' No answer appeared ; and I know of no other hint of the currency of this belief in Western Europe, unless it be the couplet:—
'A whistling maid and a crowing hen Are hateful alike to God and men,'
1 because,' according to Lieut.-Col. A. Fergusson ( Notes and Queries , August 1879, P- 93 )) though he gives no authorities, 'a woman stood by and whistled while she watched the nails for the Cross being forged.' 1
On the other hand, the Gypsies of Alsace have a legend of their own, opposed to, and probably devised expressly to refute, the gait jo or Gentile version. How there were two Jew brothers, Schmul and Rom-Schmul. The first of them exulted at the Crucifixion; the other would gladly have saved Our Lord from death, and, finding that impossible, did what he could—pilfered one of the four nails. So it came about that Christ's feet must be placed one over the other, and fastened with a single nail. And Schmul remained a Jew, but Rom-Schmul turned Christian, and was the founder of the Rdmani race (' Die Zigeuner in Elsass und in Deutschlothringen,' by Dr. G. Miihl, in Der Salon, r874). In a letter of 16th December 1880, M. Bataillard wrote: 'An Alsatian Gypsy woman, one of the Reinhart family, has been at me for some time past to procure a remission of sentence for one of her relations who has been in gaol since 2d October. "The Manousch " [Gypsies], she urges, "are not bad; they do not murder." And on my answering with a smile that unluckily they are only too prone to take what doesn't belong to them, and that the judges, knowing this, are extra severe towards them, her answer is, " It is true, it's in the blood. Besides, you surely know, you who know all about the Manousch , they have leave to steal once in seven years." " How so ? " " It's a story you surely must know. They were just going to crucify Jesus. One of our women passed by, and she whipped up one of the nails they were going to use. She would have liked to steal all four nails, but couldn't. Anyhow, it was always one, and that's why Jesus was crucified with only three nails, a single one for the two feet. And that's why Jesus

' 1 The Lithuanian Gypsies say, likewise, that ' stealing has been permitted in their favour by the crucified Jesus, because the Gypsies, being pre¬ sent at the Crucifixion, stole one of the four nails. Hence when the hands had been nailed, there was but one nail left for the feet; and therefore God allowed them to steal, and it is not accounted a sin to them.'

TWO TALES OF THREE NAILS
GEORGE A. AGOGINO ano DAVID W. PICKETT
THE WORD Gypsy' is a corruption of the word Egyptian. However, little doubt exists that their origin was not Egypt but Northwest India. Here for some unknown reason this ethnic group began their wandering about the beginning of the second millennium. It is believed that gypsies did not reach Europe until the start of the fourteenth century and by the fifteenth century were already established in their characteristic wagon-house that was to be their traveling home until recent times.? Gypsy language is basically Indian, a derivative of Sanskrit and Prakrit,' but as nomads they borrowed freely from other languages in their wanderings. Gypsy groups under settled conditions soon allow their native tongue to become distorted and corrupt with foreign words until they have difficulty in conversing with nomadic groups who speak a more uncontaminated Romany.'

The Gypsy denial of their ancestral home probably began as a defensive maneuver to assure safe conduct and freedom of passage on the open road. They explained their presence in Europe, and their nomadic way of life, with an origin myth that appealed to Medieval Catholic Europe. The Gypsies claimed they were Egyptians forced to wander as penance for having denied Christ in his hour of need. Eventually, they explained, after a nomadic
existence of sin and mental torment they would be allowed to travel to Rome, the eternal city, and expiate their sins and the sins of their ancestors at the tomb of Saint Peter.

During the spring and summer of 1958 David W. Pickett, then a graduate student at Syracuse University, collected folklore and folkmusic from Gypsies living in New York State. His investigations brought him into contact with members of the Kaldaras, Minyeski, and Rusuya Gypsy bands. Members of these groups migrated from Rumania to Mexico many years ago and recently traveled northward finally settling in New York State. The majority remained in New York City, but some also settled in upstate New York. The traditional occupations of tinkers and coppersmiths provided the basic economy, although stereotyped "gypsy trades" were also practiced to some extent.

During the spring and summer of 1958 David W. Pickett, then a graduate student at Syracuse University, collected folklore and folkmusic from Gypsies living in New York State. His investigations brought him into contact with members of the Kaldaras, Minyeski, and Rusuya Gypsy bands. Members of these groups migrated from Rumania to Mexico many years ago and recently traveled northward finally settling in New York State. The majority remained in New York City, but some also settled in upstate New York. The traditional occupations of tinkers and coppersmiths provided the basic economy, although stereotyped "gypsy trades" were also practiced to some extent.

The fieldwork was the result of David Pickett's extensive association with and careful observation of this ethnic population. The role of George Agogino, a faculty member of Syracuse University, was supervisory and restricted to listening to field tapes and suggesting proper direction for further research. During the course of this investigation two tales regarding Gypsy participation in the execution of Jesus of Nazareth were obtained that seemed to explain the penance motif of the Gypsy origin myth. The following versions are presented in the original style as recorded by David Pickett. No attempt has been made to improve sentence structure or polish the account except where it is necessary to assure proper continuity.

The first version was told to David Pickett by Munya, a Russian Gypsy, who gave the following account during a Syracuse session with the recorder. This is the legend of The Nail (O Karfin):

Sar pendiya ma mgra dad. . .As my father told me. . . .and as he was told by his father and each son by his father before them: at the time when the Roman soldiers were about to crucify Our Lord Jesus Christ there were many people gathered near Calvary, the site of the execution of three criminals, men who had broken Roman law.

The three men were lying, bound hand and foot, near their crosses. The soldiers, not concerned with the captives since they were bound, were playing dice at a distance from the three condemned ones. The holes were dug in which the crosses would be stood upright after the outlaws had been nailed to them, each with four nails, one in each hand and foot. The mallets were there too, ready to be used in pounding the nails through the flesh fastening the victims to the hideous crossed beams.

Now it happened that among the crowd gathered about Calvary that day there was a Gypsy blacksmith. This man, of those who are outlaws and thieves by nature, thought it only fitting and proper that one criminal should help another if he were able. And being a blacksmith the Gypsy went up to the soldiers with his anvil and hammer and begged permission to sharpen the points of the nails, that they might be more easily pounded through flesh and wood. Scarcely looking up from their game the soldiers bade him sharpen as many nails as he could before the execution began. So he approached the condemned ones and picked up one of the nails and began to pound it. Seeing no one watching him he picked up a second nail and shoved it under his girdle and into his rectum. Then just as he reached for a third nail the soldiers approached and kicked him away from the place with their feet. "There is no more time, blacksmith," sneered the one who had kicked him last, not knowing that the Gypsy had one of the nails already hidden inside his body. The bruised Gypsy picked him-self up and disappeared into the crowd running. He feared that the theft would be discovered before he could escape and so great was his terror that he did not even stop to recover his hammer and anvil.

The crucifixion proceeded, and all went well until the soldiers reached for the fourth nail to pin Our Lord's left foot to the cross. They dug and scraped the entire area, but could not find it. Now in those days a nail was not to be had by purchase in the open market. It had to be ordered to specification from a blacksmith who would pound and shape it from iron on his anvil. Since there was no time to seek out a blacksmith and wait for him to make a duplicate of the missing nail, the soldiers placed one of Our Lord's feet over the other and pounded both to the cross with a single point. This is why Christ was crucified with only three nails.

Now as the Holy Father in Heaven watched over Calvary from above, he had seen the Gypsy's attempt to alleviate the sufferings of the condemned by sharpening the nails even although he also planned to steal one or more of the necessary nails from the execution spot. He knew that the Gypsy people were hopeless thieves, and that they served O Kalo Beng, the Black Devil, but He felt that He must reward anyone who tried to spare the suffering of His Son, and since the Gypsy blacksmith had used thievery to reduce the number of nails driven into Christ's body. He proclaimed that henceforward the Gypsies would be forgiven for any sins of theft. At the same time since the Gypsy blacksmith had run from the place of execution Our Father punished all Gypsies by making them foreever wanderers, never resting but constantly moving from place to place. This is why the Gypsy is nomadic even today.

The second version of the same event was told by an old Gypsy of the Kaldera band named Stefano who was a gifted story teller.

His version is as follows:

The three soldiers set out to find a Blacksmith and pay him the ten picces of money to forge four large nails for the crucifixion. The first smith they encountered was a Jew. When they told him of their needs, he refused saying, "I will not forge nails to crucify the innocent or the insane, and Jesus of Nazareth is either truly the Son of God, or he is insane!" The soldiers became angry, for they had little time to procure the nails and return to Calvary. "Make the nails!" they ordered, but he would not, so they broke his skull with his own hammer.

They traveled on a short way and found another blacksmith at his forge; this smith was a Greek. They repeated their request to him, and as before, the Greek also refused to make the nails. Now the soldiers were beginning to become afraid, for they would be punished severely if they failed in their mission, and it was very late. But in spite of their threats the Greek blacksmith would not make the nails they required, so they buried his head in his own forge and set out in search of a smith who would make their nails.

Not far from the place where they had murdered the Greek, the soldiers came upon the tent of a Gypsy smith, they approached and shook his tent until he came out and greeted them with a smile of cunning and contempt as only a Gypsy, who hates all but those of his own blood, can smile. Before they could speak he addressed them, "I know what you seek. .. four nails... ." The soldiers grabbed him threateningly and cursed him as they raised their swords. "No, Romans," laughed the Gypsy. "You will not kill me, you dare not, for it is too late! I am not a Jew, nor am I a Greek, I am a Gypsy, and it is not because of my clean soul that I have refused to forge your nails, nor because I am of those who love the one who says he is the Messiah. It was my own people who denied that one lodging when they fled Herod in Egypt! I refused to make your four nails because you have only ten pieces of money, for ten pieces I will forge only three nails, and you will accept my terms because you have no time with which to haggle!"

He spat arrogantly at their feet. It was seldom that one of Caesar's soldiers had to remain silent in the face of such insult, but the Gypsy was right, they had no time at all to bargain with, they had to accept his terms. "You can crucify the little Jew you fear so much with three nails", he laughed, "Pound one through both of his feet!" And that is how it was done, just as the Gypsy had jokingly suggested.

Now the Jews had denied Our Lord Jesus, and in punishment God ordered that they be driven from their native land, but since the Jewish blacksmith had refused to make the nails to crucify Our Lord, He said that one day the Jewish People might return to their Israel, their Promised Land, again.

And then God said that in order to reward the Greeks for the deed of the Greek blacksmith one day that people would serve as the head of one half of his church. The Gypsy however, had openly defied God, he, and his whole race must be condemned! God ordered that the Romane Prale (Gypsy "brothers") must never know the comforts of a homeland, a roof, or bed; they were condemned to wander through out the world forever; never to sleep in a house, but always to live only in tents and to sleep on the ground in "tseran" (a type of Gypsy feather bed).

https://everything2.com/title/The+legend+of+the+gypsy+and+the+nails+from+the+cross

This Romany legend exists in many forms, and appears to be a genuine gypsy tale, rather than one attributed to them by outsiders.

In the version I grew up with, a gypsy smith was approached by a Roman legionnaire, and commissioned to forge twelve large nails. Used to jobs of this kind, and having no reason to question his patrons, the smith did as he was bid, only to learn that the nails were to be used to fix Christ and the robbers to their crosses.

Stricken with remorse, the gypsy handed his son three of the nails, and bid him flee with them.

When the Centurion arrived to collect, the smith said that he had only had time to complete nine, and handed these over.

The Roman was forced to make do with what he had, securing the three victims to their crosses with only three nails apiece, thus saving them much pain.

The young thief, the three nails safely hidden, passed the foot of the cross as he fled, and Jesus smiled down on him and blessed him, excusing the gypsies ever after from commiting a sin when they stole, and thus theft is not an immoral act for the Romany.

However, an angry mob, discovering that the nails that executed Jesus were gypsy work, drove the smith and his kin from their land, and they have been doomed to be chased on ever since, wandering and unable to settle until the three missing nails are discovered, and their persecution ends

In other versions, a gypsy woman stole a bag of nails from a Roman soldier, with the same effect of lessening the Christ's pain, and in still others a gypsy child (either boy or girl depending on the teller) stole a fourth golden nail which was destined to be driven through Jesus' heart, thereby saving his life, and allowing the resurrection.

All the legends have one feature in common however -- for their service to the Son of God, the gypsies are immune to damnation for the sin of theft, and can therefore steal with impunity.

When the Roman jailers were going to crucify Yeshua ben Miriam, whom the world later called Jesus, two soldiers were sent to get four big nails. They spent half the money they had been given drinking in a tavern, and then went to look for a blacksmith: 'Man, we want four big nails made right away, to crucify Yeshua ben Miriam with, who has talked ill of our emperor. Here is money to pay for them.' But the blacksmith, an old Jew, refused to forge the nails. The soldiers set fire to his heard and ran their lances through him.

They told the next blacksmith, also a Jew, to make them four big nails, and put down what was left of their money. But he said he could only make four small nails for that price. They set his beard on fire too. Frightened out of his wits, he started to make the nails; but when one of the soldiers said they must be good and strong because they were to crucify Yeshua ben Miriam, he heard the voice of the first blacksmith forbidding him to make the nails, for Yeshua ben Miriam was innocent. He too refused, and the soldiers ran their lances through him.

The third blacksmith they found was a Syrian, who was just finishing work for the day. Seeing their lances all bloody, he blew up his furnace and started to make the nails; but he too heard the voices of both the murdered blacksmiths, and refused to carry on. The soldiers ran their lances through him.

Outside the gates of Jerusalem they found a Gypsy smith and ordered him to make four stout nails. The Gypsy pocketed the money first. As he made each nail the soldiers put it in a bag. When he was making the fourth nail towards nightfall the voices of the three murdered blacksmiths were heard again. The soldiers ran off in panic. The Gypsy, glad he had pocketed the money first, finished making the fourth nail and waited for it to grow cold. But it kept on glowing, no matter how much water he threw over it. Terrified, he packed up his tent on his donkey and fled into the desert; but the glowing nail followed him, no matter how he tried to get rid of it. That nail always appears in the tents of the descendants of that man who forged the nails for the Crucifixion. And when the nail appears, the Gypsies run. That is why they move from one place to another.'

The Welsh gypsies : children of Abram Wood
by Jarman, Eldra
Publication date 1998
One legend associates the Gypsies with the Crucifixion. It tells of two Roman soldiers who were provided with money and instructed to buy four strong nails. They spent half of the money, however, drinking in a tavern and it was late afternoon before they remembered the mission on which they had been sent. They hurried along to an old Jewish blacksmith who refused to make the nails when he heard of the use to which they were to be put. Angered, the soldiers stabbed and killed him. They then sought out another blacksmith who told them that for the money he could only forge four small nails. The soldiers frightened him by setting his beard alight and he set to work. As he was working one of the soldiers said to him: 'Make them good and strong, Jew; for at dawn we crucify Yeshua ben Miriam.' Hearing the name the Jew hesitated and ceased his work. The voice of the man whom the soldiers had killed came faintly to his ears: 'Aria, do not make the nails. They are for one of our own people, an innocent man.' The smith refused to continue with his work and was put to death. Thereupon, on leaving the city, the soldiers came upon a Gypsy who had set up an anvil by his tent and ordered him to forge the nails. He pocketed the money offered him and made three nails without delay. While he was working on the fourth nail, however, one of the soldiers told him that the nails would be used the following morning to crucify Jesus. The soldier had hardly finished speaking when the trembling voices of the blacksmiths who had been killed were heard pleading with the Gypsy not to make the nails. The frightened soldiers ran away but the Gypsy proceeded to finish the fourth nail, and then waited for it to grow cold. This did not happen, for the nail remained as red-hot as if it were still being held in the furnace. Water poured over it had no effect and it continued to glow, illuminating a wide stretch of the desert. The terrified Gypsy packed his tent on his donkey and fled. After travelling some distance he pitched the tent between two high sand-dunes, but there at his feet he saw the glowing nail as he had left it at the gates of Jerusalem. Throughout the night he poured water and sand upon it, but in vain. Crazed with fear, the Gypsy again packed his belongings and fled further into the desert, arriving presently at an Arab village. However, the nail had followed him. An Arab approached him and asked him to repair the iron hoop of a wheel. Quickly the Gypsy used the glowing nail to do this, and then watched the Arab driving away with it. He now believed that he was rid of the nail but some time later, in Damascus, a man brought him the hilt of a sword for repair. There, within the hilt, was the glowing nail. The Gypsy again packed and fled, but the nail always appeared within the tents of his descendants. Thus the Gypsies were condemned to perpetual wandering. Jesus was crucified with three nails, one of which was used to pierce his two feet drawn together. The fourth nail wanders from one end of the earth to the other, in pursuit of the people whose forefather had forged the other three.
