Imagine, if you will, Bendigeidfran, Bran the Blessed, son of Llyr, a giant of a man, was king. King of the Island of the Mighty. No ship could carry him, no house could give him shelter. And Branwen, his sister, the most beautiful girl in this world and the other.

One day, thirteen fast ships were spied approaching the Pembrokeshire coast. Irish ships. At the prow, a shiled, it's point faced upwards, a sign they came in peace.

Matholwch, the King of Ireland, was greeted ashore and taken to Bendigeidfran, seeking to marry Branwen, as a sign of peace between the two kingdoms.

"A splendid idea", said Bendigeidfran and his advisers, and so it was agreed. The feasting, and the drinking, and the carousing began, and that night, as was the custom, Matholwch and Branwen spent the night together, at the start of what would be the three days of their hand-fasting ceremony.

As the festivities began, Matholwch's men and horses were billeted far and wide, and it was at one of these billets that, Efnysien, Bendigeidfran's half-brother by his mother, a man who could cause two of the most loving brothers to fight, and who was just returned from a journey far to the north, was to find.

"Whose are these horses?" and he was told: the horses of Matholwych , King of Ireland, who is now married to Branwen.

Efnysien was not happy, he was not happy at all - he should have been consulted, for Branwen was his sister, and, and... and so he took his sword, and he started to mutilate the horses: he pared their gums to their teeth, their tales to their back, their ears to their heads, their eyelids to their skulls.

Word got back to Matholwch. What treachery was this? He took offense as well he might, and started to leave, with Branwen in tow.

Bendigeidfran called him back, offered recompense. But the honour price was too high — the life of Efnysien. Instead, Bendigeidfran offered a horse for each horse that was mutiliated, a silver rod the width of his thumb, and as tool as he stood, and a gold plate the size of his head.

Mathalwch was persuaded to stary, but the good cheer that had bound the two Kings together the previous night was gone. Bendigeidfran filled the silence with a promise of another gift - the cauldron of rebirth. If a man that had died that day was put into the cauldron, he would libve again the next day, although without the power of speech.

And so Mathalwch departed, along with his new wife, Branwen. And the Irishmen swore to never mention the humiliation that Mathalwch had suffered with the mutilation of his horses.

THings went well at first, and before long, a son was born, Gwern. But as the years passed by, the mutterings began, about how Matholwch had been humiliated. And so, Branwen was humiliated in turn, forced to work in the kitchens, her head slapped and beaten by the cook and the butcher each day.

But what could she do?

One day, she found a starling, its wing damaged, in the courtyard. She nursed it, trained it, and one day attached a message to it in a small bag attached to its chest, and sent it on its way to her brother, to Bendigeidfran.

When he received the message, he was furious — what brother wouldn't be — and summoned his men and set of accross the sea. Bendigeidfran, the giant that he was, was too big for any ship, and he walked through the sea, the fleet assembeled around him.

On the Irish coast, a pig-herder, tending his... flock? do you have a flock of pigs? A drove? A sounder?... saw something on the horizon he had never witnessed before. A forest, coming closer, a forest, and a mountain, a mountain on which there was a high ridge, with two lakes, one on either side.

He rushed to inform the king, who could make no sense of what the babbling idiot was talking about. But Branwen knew: the forest was the masts of the ships of her brother's men, the mountain was Bendigeidfran himself, the ridge his nose, the two lakes, his eyes.

Mathalwch retreated over the river Liffey, tearing down the bridges as they crossed over it. The lodestone in the riverbed would destroy any ships that tried to cross the river, teraring out the nails that head them together.

When Bendigeidfran and his men reached the bridge, the giant let out a cry that is still a proverb in Wales to this day: "let he who is a leader, be a bridge", and it was so.

Bendigeidfran lay across the river, and his men walked over him in pursuit of the Irish men.

Mathelwch surrendered, offered his son Gwern, Bendigeifren's nephew, to be king of Ireland. But this was not honour price was not enough for Bendigeidfran.

Mathelwch, once again, completely out of ideas, turned to Branwen. "Was there anything that would placate him?"

"THere has never been a house big enough that he could enter", she said, "so make him a house he might fit in".

And so the house was built.

But pins were placed on the hundred columns that held up the great hall, and sacks were humngs on the pins, and in the sacks were hidden Irish soldiers set to ambush Bendigeidfran's men.

When Efnysian came to inspect the hall, he saw the sacks and he asked what was in then. "Flour," they said, and so he felt the bag, felt the man's head inside the bag, and squeezed. And squeezed more; and squeezed until the man's skull gave way, and all that was left was squish. And he went to the second bag: "an this is...?" "Flour". "Ah ha...". And he squeuezed, and he squeszzed, and it squished once more. And so it went on...

That night, the great house was filled with the men of both armies, seated ound a great fire in the center. There was drinking. A lot of drinking... 
And the tension between them lessened, perhaps.

But Efnysien, always Efnysien... "Why doesn't my sister's boy, my very own nephew, come to greet me?" he said, and Gwern was brought forward to meet him... At which point, he let out a bellow "the outrage I shall now commit will shall be a surpise to everyone", grabbed the boym and through him into the raging fire, kicking him back in as the boy tried to save himself.

But it was too late. The fighting began. The fighting went on all night, and both sides lost many men. Afterwards, in the Irish camp, a smaller fire could be seen, a dull red glow beneath a cauldron, a cauldron into which the Irish dead were thrown, and out of which they stepped again, voiceless, the living undead.

The next day the fighting began again, the losses terrible on both sides.
Efnysien, realising perhaps, what he had started, saw that with the Cauldron of Rebirth, there would be a neever ending stream of Irish soldiers to fight against, no matter how many they killed. So that night, he covered himself with mud, and blood, and lay among the Irish dead as if he were one of them. When he was thrown into the cauldron, the shock of a living body being thrown in and the strength of Efnysien shattered the cauldron. But it also killed Efnysien.

The battle was all but over. Bendigeidfran would have survived, were it not for the poison on the tip of the spear that pierced his foot. And started to spread. "Cut off my head" he said, "I will still be good company for your, for seven years in Harlech, and eighty years after that.But do not open the door that facees Cornwall," he said, "or sorrow will end it all. And then you must bury my head, on the White Hill in London, facing France".

And so they did. And of all the men who had left the Island of the Mighty only seven returned. Only seven, and Branwen.

Distraught. In her sorrow, her heart was broken, she died and was buried.

The seven then feasted for seven years in Harlech, and the head og Bedigeifran the giant was good company indeed. And then they went to the island of Grassholm off the Pembrokeshire coast, and continued their feasting and their drinking there, and it as to them as if time did not pass.

Now in the hall where they lioved, there were three doors. Two of them were often opened, but the third, the door that faced Cornwall, remained closed. But over the years, for one of them, it became too much.

"Shame upon my beard," he said, after the eighty years foretold by the prophecy has passed, "if I donlt find out if the prophecy is true", and he opened the door.

And the wight of years, and the sorrows of their lives, and their brothers lives, and of all those that had died in the battle, and more, fell upon them.

And so they made they way to London. And there, under the White Hill, they buried the head of the giant Bendigeidfran, Bran the Blessed, the Blessed Crow, facing south to protect the Island of the Mighty against foreign invaders from France.

And though the story may have been lost to us, in England at least, though not to the Welsh, the memory of it remains. In the forms of the rooks — the crows — in the Tower of London today.

And that is the end of the story, of Bran and Branwen, of the second branch of the Mabinogion.
