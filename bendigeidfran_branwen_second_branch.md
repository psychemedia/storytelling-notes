# Benigeidfran and Branwen

Imagine, if you will, Bendigeidfran, Bran the Blessed, son of Llyr, a giant of a man, King of the Island of the Mighty, King of the island of Britain. No ship could carry him, no house could give him shelter. A giant of a man. And Branwen, his sister. Branwen, the most beautiful girl in the world. Branwen, the most beautiful girl in this world, or the other.

One day, thirteen fast ships were spied approaching the Pembrokeshire coast. Irish ships. At the prow, a shield, its point faced upwards, a sign that they came in peace.

Matholwch, the King of Ireland, was greeted ashore and taken to Bendigeidfran. He was seeking marriage with Branwen, a marriage treaty between their two kingdoms.

"A splendid idea", said Bendigeidfran and his advisers, and so it was agreed. The feasting, and the drinking, and the carousing began. And that night, as was the custom, Matholwch and Branwen spent together, as the start of what would be their three days of hand-fasting.

As the festivities began, Matholwch's men and horses were billeted far and wide. And it was at one of these new billets that was seen by Efnysien, just as he returned from a journey far to the north. Efnysien, Bendigeidfran's half-brother on his mother's side, a man so bitter, a man so twisted, he could pitch two of the most loving brothers into mortal battle.

"Whose are these horses?" and he was told: the horses of Matholwych, King of Ireland, who is now married to Branwen.

Efnysien was not happy, he was not happy at all. He was furious; he should have been consulted, for Branwen was his sister, and, and... and so he took his sword, and he started to mutilate the horses: he pared their gums to their teeth, their tails to their backs, their ears to their heads, and their eyelids to their skulls.

And word got back to Matholwch. What treachery was this? He took offense as well he might, and started to leave, with Branwen in tow.

Bendigeidfran called him back, offered recompense. But the honour price was too high — the life of Efnysien. Instead, Bendigeidfran offered a horse for each horse that was mutilated, a silver rod the width of Matholwch's thumb, and as tall as he stood, and a gold plate the size of his head.

Matholwch was persuaded to stary, but the good cheer that had bound the two Kings together the previous night was gone. Bendigeidfran filled the silence with a promise of another gift - the cauldron of rebirth. If a man that had died that day was put into the cauldron, he would live again the next day, although without the power of speech.

And so Matholwch departed, along with his new wife, Branwen. And the Irishmen swore never to mention the humiliation that Matholwch had suffered on that trip.

Things went well at first. Before long, a son was born, Gwern. But as the years passed by, the mutterings began, about how Matholwch had been humiliated. And Matholwch, well, his humiliation started over again, but at home this time. And so, Branwen was humiliated in turn, forced to work in the kitchens, her head slapped and beaten by the cook and the butcher each day.

But what could she do?

One day, she found a starling in the courtyard. Its wing was hurt, damaged. She nursed it, and it recovered; she trained it, and trained it well; and one day attached a message to it, and sent it on its way to her brother, to Bendigeidfran.

When he received the message, he was furious, cursing — what brother wouldn't be? — cursed, and raged, and summoned his men to set off across the sea. Bendigeidfran, giant that he was, was too big for any ship, and he walked through the sea; the fleet sailed at his side.

On the Irish coast, a pig-herder, tending his... flock? do you have a flock of pigs? A drove? A sounder?... saw something on the horizon he had never witnessed before. A forest; a forest, coming closer;  a forest, and a mountain; a mountain on which there was a high ridge; a high ridge with two lakes, one on either side.

The pig herder rushed to inform the king, who could make no sense of what the babbling idiot was talking about. But Branwen knew: and she told Matholwch. The forest was the masts of the ships of her brother's men, the mountain was Bendigeidfran himself, the ridge his nose, the two lakes, his eyes.

Matholwch retreated. Over the river Liffey they went, tearing down the bridges as they did so. The lodestone in the riverbed would destroy any ships that tried to cross the river, would tear out any nails that held the ships together.

When Bendigeidfran and his men reached the bridge, the giant let out a cry that is still a proverb in Wales to this day: "let he who is a leader, be a bridge". And it was so.

Bendigeidfran lay across the river, and his men walked over him in pursuit of the Irish.

Mathelwch surrendered, offered his son Gwern, Bendigeifren's nephew, to be king of Ireland. But this honour price was not enough for Bendigeidfran, there to avenge the slight against his sister, against his people.

Mathelwch, once again, completely out of ideas, turned to Branwen. Was there anything that would placate him?

"There has never been a house big enough that he could enter", she said, "so make him a house he might fit in".

And so the house was built.

But as the house was built, hooks were placed on either side of the hundred great columns that held up the roof of the great hall, and two hundred sacks were hung on the hooks, and in the sacks were hidden Irish soldiers set to ambush Bendigeidfran's men.

When Efnysian came to inspect the hall, he saw the sacks on the hooks, and he asked what was in them. "Flour," they said, and so he felt the first bag, felt the man's head inside the bag, and squeezed. And squeezed some more; and squeezed until the man's skull gave way. Squeezed and squished.

And then he went to the second bag: "and this is...?" "Flour". "Ah ha...". And he squeezed, and he squeszzed some more. And then it squished. And so it went on...

That night, the great house was filled with the men of both armies, seated round a great fire in the center. There was eating; and drinking. A lot of drinking...  And the tension between them lessened, perhaps.

But Efnysien, always Efnysien... "Why doesn't my sister's boy, my very own nephew, come to greet me?" he said. And Gwern was brought forward to meet him... At which point, Efnysien took everyone by surprise, madly laughing calling out "I bet none of you expected this", at which point he grabbed the boy and threw him into the raging fire, kicking him back into the fire as the boy tried to save himself it, for good measure.

But it was too late. Gwern was dead.

The fighting began. The fighting went on all night, and both sides lost many men. Afterwards, in the Irish camp, a smaller fire could be seen, a dull red glow beneath a cauldron, a cauldron into which the Irish dead were thrown, and out of which they stepped again, voiceless, the living undead.

The next day the fighting began again, the losses terrible on both sides.

Efnysien, realising perhaps, the awful consequences of what he had started, saw that with the Cauldron of Rebirth, there would be a never ending stream of Irish soldiers to fight against, no matter how many were killed. So that night, he covered himself with mud, and blood, and lay among the Irish dead as if he were one of them. When he was thrown into the cauldron, the shock of a living body being thrown in to the magical maelstrom it contained, and the strength of him as he pushed against the inside walls cauldron, shattered it into a thousand pieces. And shattered Efnysien with it.

The battle was all but over. And Bendigeidfran would perhaps have survived, were it not for the poison on the tip of the spear that pierced his foot. Poison that had started to spread. "Cut off my head" he said, "I will still be good company for you, for seven years in Harlech, and eighty years after that.But do not open the door that faces Cornwall," he rather cryptically said, "or sorrow will end it all. And then you must bury my head, on the White Hill in London, facing south".

And so they did. And of all the men who had left the Island of the Mighty only seven returned. Only seven, and Branwen. And the chatty head of Bendigeidfran, carried on the the golden platter that had been given to Matholwch several years before.

Back in Wales, Branwen was distraught. In her sorrow, her heart was broken. She died and was buried.

The seven then feasted for seven years in Harlech, and the head of Bedigeidfran the giant was good company indeed. And then they went to the island of Grassholm, off the Pembrokeshire coast, and continued their feasting and their drinking there. And it seemed to them as if time did not pass.

Now, the hall in which they lived had three doors. They made use of two of them, but the third one, the door that faced Cornwall, that door had always been closed.

But as the years went by, for one of the seven, it started to become too much. And after the eighty years foretold by Bendigeidfran's prophecy had passed, it really became too much.

"Shame upon my beard," he said, "if I don't find out what happens if I open that door".

And as he did so, the weight of years, and the weight of all the sorrows of their lives, and their brothers lives, and of all those that had died in the battle, and more, fell upon them.

And so, they left. They made their way to London. And there, under the White Hill, they buried the head of the giant Bendigeidfran, Bran the Blessed, the Blessed Crow, facing south to protect the Island of the Mighty against foreign invaders from France.

And though the story may have been lost to many, in England at least, though not, perhaps, to the Welsh, the memory of it remains. In the form of the rooks — the crows — of the Tower of London today. Who will protect England against invasion as long as they are there.

And so ends the story, the story of Bran and Branwen, the story of the second branch of the Mabinogion.
