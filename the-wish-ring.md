# The Wish Ring

I first heard this story told by Daniel Morden as part of his Covid lockdown podcast series, as supported by a stability grant from the Arts Council of Wales's National Lottery Fund (["The Ring", Daneil Morden podcast](https://podbay.fm/p/daniel-morden-storyteller/e/1607284800)).

I'm pretty sure I heard Daniel say somewhere (FATE 2021, maybe, in a lunch queue, telling someone else?) that it had come via an old collection of Welsh traditional tales, but the only place I've so far tracked it down to is the Vol 10 Iss 12 issue of the St Nicholas magazine, from October, 1883, [p938-9](https://archive.org/details/sim_saint-nicholas-a-magazine-for-boys-and-girls_1883-10_10_12/page/938/mode/2up?q=%22wish+ring%22), and then reprinted in *Fairy stories retold from St. Nicholas*, 1906, [p185-192](https://archive.org/details/FairyStoriesRetoldFromStNicholas/page/n195/mode/2up?q=%22wish+ring%22), from which the following image is also taken.

```{admonition} THie Wish Ring, translated from the German by Anna Eichberg

A YOUNG farmer who was very unlucky sat on his plow a moment to rest, and just then an old woman crept past and cried : "Why do you go on drudging day and night without reward? Walk two days till you come to a great fir tree that stands all alone in the forest and overtops all other trees. If you can hew it down, you will make your fortune."

Not waiting to have the advice repeated, the farmer shouldered his ax and started on his journey. Sure enough, after tramping two days, he came to the fir tree, which he instantly prepared to cut down. Just as the tree swayed, and before it fell with a crash, there dropped out of its branches a nest containing two eggs. The eggs rolled to the ground and broke, and there darted out of one a young eagle and out of the other rolled a gold ring. The eagle grew larger, as if by enchantment, and when it reached the size of a man, it spread its wings as if to try their strength, then, soaring upward, it cried: "You have rescued me ; take as a reward the ring that lay in the other egg; it is a wish-ring. Turn it on your finger twice, and whatever your wish is, it shall be fulfilled. But remember there is but a single wish in the ring. No sooner is that granted than it loses its power and is only an ordinary ring. Therefore, consider well what you desire, so that you may never have reason to repent your choice." So speaking, the eagle soared high in the air, circled over the farmer's head a few times, then darted, like an arrow, toward the east.

The farmer took the ring, placed it on his finger, and turned on his way homeward. Toward evening, he reached a town where a jeweler sat in his shop behind a counter, on which lay many costly rings for sale. The farmer showed his own, and asked the merchant its value.

"It is not worth a straw," the jeweler answered.

Upon that, the farmer laughed very heartily, and told the man that it was a wish-ring, and of greater value than all the rings in the shop together.

The jeweler was a wicked, designing man, and so he invited the farmer to remain as his guest over night. "For," he explained, "only to shelter a man who owns a wish-ring must bring luck." So he treated his guest to wine and fair words ; and that night, as the farmer lay sound asleep, the wicked man stole the magic ring from his finger and slipped on, in its place, a common one which he had made to resemble the wish-ring.

The next morning, the jeweler was all impatience to have the farmer begone. He awakened him at cock-crow, and said: "You had better go, for you have still a long journey before you."

As soon as the farmer had departed, the jeweler closed his shop, put up the shutters, so that no one could peep in, bolted the door behind him, and, standing in the middle of the room, he turned the ring and cried: "I wish instantly to possess a million gold pieces !"

No sooner said than the great, shining gold pieces came pouring down upon him in a golden torrent over his head, shoulders, and arms. Pitifully he cried for mercy, and tried to reach and unbar the door ; but before he succeeded, he stumbled and fell bleeding to the ground. As for the golden rain, it never stopped till the weight of the metal crushed the floor, and the jeweler and his money sank through to the cellar. The gold still poured down till the million was complete, and the jeweler lay dead in the cellar beneath his treasure.

The noise, however, alarmed the neighbors, who came rushing over to see what the matter was ; when they saw the man dead under his gold, they exclaimed: "Doubly unfortunate he whom blessings kill." Afterward, the heirs came and divided the property.

In the meantime, the farmer reached home in high spirits and showed the ring to his wife.

"Henceforth we shall never more be in want, dear wife," he said. "Our fortune is made. Only we must be very careful to consider well just what we ought to wish."

The farmer's wife, of course, proffered advice. "Suppose," said she, "that we wish for that bit of land that lies between our two fields ?"

"That isn't worth while," her husband replied. "If we work hard for a year, we 'll earn enough money to buy it."

So the two worked very hard, and at harvest time they had never raised such a crop before. They had earned money enough to buy the coveted strip of land and still have a bit to spare. "See," said the man, "we have the land and the wish as well."

The farmer's wife then suggested that they had better wish for a cow and a horse. But the man replied: "Wife, why waste our wish on such trifles? The horse and cow we'll get anyway."

Sure enough, in a year's time the money for the horse and cow had been earned. Joyfully the man rubbed his hands. "The wish is saved again this year, and yet we have what we desire. How lucky we are !"

But now his wife seriously adjured him to wish for something at last. "Now that you have a wish to be granted," she said, "you slave and toil, and are content with everything. You might be king, emperor, baron, even a gentleman farmer, with chests overflowing with gold ; but you don't know what you want."

"We are young and life is long," he answered. "There is only one wish in the ring, and that is easily said. Who knows but sometime we may sorely need this wish? Are we in want of anything? Have we not prospered, to all people's astonishment, since we possessed this ring? Be reasonable and patient for a while. In the meantime, consider what we really ought to wish for."

And that was the end of the matter.

It really seemed as if the ring had brought a blessing into the house. Granaries and barns were full to overflowing, and in the course of a few years the poor farmer became a rich and portly person, who worked with his men afield during the day, as if he, too, had to earn his daily bread ; but after supper he liked to sit in his porch, contented and comfortable, and return the kindly greeting of the folk who passed and who wished him a respectful good-evening.

So the years went by. Sometimes, when they were alone, the farmer's wife would remind her husband of the magic ring, and suggest many plans. But as he always answered that they had plenty of time, and that the best thoughts come last, she more and more rarely mentioned the ring, and, at last, ceased speaking of it altogther.

To be sure, the farmer looked at the ring, and twirled it about as many as twenty times a day; but he was very careful never to wish.

After thirty or forty years had passed away, and the farmer and his wife had grown old and white-haired, and their wish was still unasked, then was God very good to them, and on the same night they died peacefully and happily.

Weeping children and grand-children wished to remove the ring from the still hand as a remembrance, the oldest son said : "Let our father take his ring with him. There was always a mystery about it; perhaps it was some dear remembrance. Our mother, too, so often looked at the ring â€” she may have given it to him when they were young."

So the old farmer was buried with the ring, which had been supposed to be a wish-ring, and was not; yet it brought as much good fortune into the house as heart could desire.

Following Daniel Morden's telling, I have been telling this with an ending along the lines of *"the ring may not have contained a wish at all, the ring being swapped by the greedy jeweller all those years ago, but it did contain a much deeper magic, that of `hope`"*, but I'm not sure that's right? The ring provided some sort of _confidence_, born of trust, or faith, in the "insurance" of the support that the ring would be able to provide, albeit once only, if it were required.
