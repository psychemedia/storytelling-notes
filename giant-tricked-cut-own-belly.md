BOOTS WHO ATE A MATCH WITH THE TROLL.

ONCE on a time there was a farmer, who had three sons; his means were small, and he was old sad weak, and his sons would take to nothing. A fine large wood belonged to the farm, and one day the father told his sons to go and hew wood, and try to pay off some of hie debts.

Well, after a long talk, he got them to set off, and the eldest was to go first. But when he had got well into the wood, and began to hew at a mossy old fir, what should he see coming up to him but a great sturdy Troll.

" If you hew in this wood of mine," siud the Troll, "I'll kill you!"

When the lad heard that, be threw the axe down, and ran off home as fast as he could lay legs to the ground ; 80 he came in quite out of breath, and told them what had happened, but his father called him " hare-heart," — no Troll would ever have soared him from hewing when he was young, he said.

Next day the second sou's turn came, and he fared just the same. He bad Bcarce hewn three Btrokea at the fir, before the Troll came to him too, and said, —

" If yon hew in this wood of mine, I 'II kill you."

The lad dared not bo much as look at him, but threw down the axe, took to his heels, and came scampering home joHt like his brother. So when he got home, hiB father was angry agMn, and said no Troll had ever scared him when he was young.

The third day Boots wanted to set off.

" Yon, indeed I " said the two elder brothers ; "you'll do it bravely, no doubt I you, who have scarce ever set your foot out of the door."

Boots said nothing to thisi bnt only begged them to give him a good store of food. His mother had no cheese, so she set the pot on the fire to make him a little, and he put it into a scrip and set off. So when he had hewn a bit, Uie Troll came to him too, and said, —

" If you hew in this wood of mine, I '11 kill you."

Bnt the lad was not slow ; he pulled his cheese ont of the scrip in a trice, and squeezed it till the whey ^urted out.

" Hold your tongue I " he cried to the Troll, " or III squeeze yon as I squeeze the water out of tliis white stone."

" Stay, dear friend ," said the Troll, "only spare me, and I'll help you to hew."

Wei], on those terms ihe lad was willing to spare him, and the Troll hewed so bravel;, that they felkd and cut up man;, many fathoms in Uie day.

But when even drew near, the Troll said, —

"Now you'd better come home witii me, for my house 18 nearer than yours."

So the lad was willing enough ; and when tliey reached the Troll's bouse, the Troll was to make up the fire, while the lad went to fetch water for their porridge, and there stood two iron pails so big and heavy, that he could 'nt so much aa lift them from the ground.

"Pooh!" sadthelad," it isn't worth while to touch these finger-basins. I'll just go and fetch the spring itself."

" Nay, nay, dear friend !" said the Troll ; " I can't afford to lose my Rpring ; just you make up tie fire, and I'll go and fetch the wat«r."

So when he came back with the water, they set to and boiled up a great pot of porridge.

" It's all the same to me," said the lad ; " but if you're of my mind, we'll eat a match!"

" With all my heart," said the Troll, for he thought he could surely hold his own in eating. So they eat down ; but the lad took his scrip unawares to the Troll, and hung it before him, and so he spooned more into the scrip than he &t« himself; and when the scrip was fall, he took up his knife and made a slit in the scrip. The Troll looked on all the while, but said never a word. So when they had eaten a good bit longer, the Troll laid down his spoon, saying, " Nay ! but I can't eat a morsel more."

" Bnt you shall eat," said the youth ; " I'm only half done ; why don't yon do as I did, and cut a bole in your paunch ? You'll be able to eat then as much as you please."

"Bnt doesn't it hart one cruelly?" asked the TroU.

" Oh," said the youth, " nothing to speak of."

So the Troll did as the lad said, and then you must know very well that he lost his life ; but the lad took all the silver and gold that he found in the hill-side, and went home with it, and you may fancy it went a great way to pay off the debt.

> [Jack] proceeded on his journey to Wales.
>
> Jack made the best of his way by travelling as fast as he could, but lost his road, and was benighted, and could find any habitation until, coming into a narrow valley, he found a large house, and in order to get shelter took courage to knock at the gate. But what was his surprise when there came forth a monstrous giant with two heads; yet he did not appear so fiery as the others were, for he was a Welsh giant, and what he did was by private and secret malice under the false show of friendship. Jack, having told his condition to the giant, was shown into a bedroom, where, in the dead of night, he heard his host in another apartment muttering these words:
>
>  "Though here you lodge with me this night,
> You shall not see the morning light
>  My club shall dash your brains outright!"
>
> "Say'st thou so," quoth Jack; "that is like one of your Welsh tricks, yet I hope to be cunning enough for you." Then, getting out of bed, he laid a billet in the bed in his stead, and hid himself in a corner of the room. At the dead time of the night in came the Welsh giant, who struck several heavy blows on the bed with his club, thinking he had broken every bone in Jack's skin. The next morning Jack, laughing in his sleeve, gave him hearty thanks for his night's lodging. "How have you rested?" quoth the giant; "did you not feel anything in the night?" "No," quoth Jack, "nothing but a rat, which gave me two or three slaps with her tail." With that, greatly wondering, the giant led Jack to breakfast, bringing him a bowl containing four gallons of hasty pudding. Being loth to let the giant think it too much for him, Jack put a large leather bag under his loose coat, in such a way that he could convey the pudding into it without its being perceived. Then, telling the giant he would show him a trick, taking a knife, Jack ripped open the bag, and out came all the hasty pudding. Whereupon, saying, "Odds splutters hur nails, hur can do that trick hurself," the monster took the knife, and ripping open his belly, fell down dead.
