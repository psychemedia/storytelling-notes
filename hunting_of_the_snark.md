# The Hunting of the Snark

__FIT I.—THE LANDING.__

*Fit the First.*

THE LANDING

"Just the place for a Snark!" the Bellman cried,  
⁠As he landed his crew with care;  
Supporting each man [at] the top of the tide  
[With] a finger entwined in his hair.

"Just the place for a Snark! I have said it twice:  
⁠That alone should encourage the crew.  
Just the place for a Snark! I have said it thrice:  
⁠What I tell you three times is true."

The crew was complete: it included a Boots—  
[⁠And a] maker of Bonnets and Hoods—  
A Barrister, brought to arrange their disputes—  
⁠And a Broker, to value their goods.

A Billiard-marker, whose skill was immense,  
⁠Might perhaps have won more than his share—  
But a Banker, engaged at enormous expense,  
`Does nothing ever change?`  
⁠Had the whole of their cash in his care.

There was also a Beaver, that paced on the deck,  
⁠Or would sit making lace in the bow:  
And [who, it was said, often] saved them from wreck,  
[But] none of the sailors knew how.

There was one who was famed for the number of things  
⁠He forgot when he entered the ship:  
His umbrella, his watch, all his jewels and rings,  
⁠And the clothes he had bought for the trip.

He had forty-two boxes, all carefully packed,  
⁠With his name painted clearly on each:  
But, since he omitted to mention the fact,  
⁠They were all left behind on the beach.

The loss of his clothes hardly mattered, because  
⁠He had seven coats on when he came,  
With three pairs of boots—but the worst of it was,  
⁠He had wholly forgotten his name.

*He'd answer to "oi, you", or "wot's-his-face", but "thing-um-a-jig was probably the most commonly used name for him.*

...

He came as a Baker: but owned, when too late—  
⁠And it drove the poor Bellman half-mad—  
He could only bake Bridecake—for which, I may state,  
⁠No materials were to be had.

The last of the crew needs especial remark,  
[For he seemed] an incredible dunce:  
He had just one idea—but, that one being "Snark,"  
⁠The good Bellman engaged him at once.

He came as a Butcher: but gravely declared,  
⁠When the ship had been sailing a week,  
He could only kill Beavers. The Bellman looked scared,  
⁠And was almost too frightened to speak:

But at length he explained, in a tremulous tone,  
⁠There was only one Beaver on board;  
And that was a tame one he had of his own,  
⁠[And] whose death would be deeply deplored.

The Beaver, who happened to hear the remark,  
⁠Protested, with tears in its eyes,  
That not even the rapture of hunting the Snark  
⁠Could atone for that dismal surprise!

*It asked the Captain if the Butcher could be transported in a separate ship, or towed behind in a rowing boat, or even left behind altogether, but the logistics were already hard enough, so the Captain refused.*

*The rest of the crew made various suggestions, such as a dagger proof coat, or an insurance policy against fire, or hail , but they were no real help. So the Beaver just had to keep its distance, and either just look away, or give dagger looks of its own to the Butcher, if ever he came near.*

__Fit the Second.__

*THE BELLMAN'S SPEECH.*

*It has to be said, though, the crew looked up to the Bellman, the Captain, and he, in turn, tried to do his best for them.*

*For example,*

He had bought a large map representing the sea,  
⁠Without the least vestige of land:  
And the crew were [most] pleased when they found it to be  
⁠A map they could all understand.

What's the good of Mercator's North Poles and Equators,  
⁠Tropics, Zones, and Meridian Lines?"  
So the Bellman would cry and the crew would reply  
⁠"They are merely conventional signs!"

*And they all agreed that having a simple map like that meant they could all read it perfectly well when all they could see around them was sea.*

*Now,*

This was charming, no doubt, but [soon they] found out  
⁠That the Captain they trusted so well  
Had only one notion for crossing the ocean,  
⁠And that was to tingle his bell.

*He also seemed to be rather confused by the notions of port and starboard, which is to say left and right, and often got the front and the back [technical terms] of the boat confused too.*

*But by some means — quite how, I don't really know! —  they'd managed to complete their journey.*

[Anyway:] the danger was past— [and they'd] landed at last,  
⁠With their boxes, portmanteaus, and bags:  
[But] at first sight the crew, were not pleased with the view,  
⁠Which consisted of chasms and crags.

*At this point, the Bellman sensed their concern, and so he followed the management training he'd picked up in a self-guiided course he taken just before starting the voyage and tried a few jokes.*

*Which didn't go down well.*

*So he thought back to the "All you need to know about being a great leader" book, cracked open the rum, shared it between the crew, and started a motivational pep talk.*

"Friends, Romans, and countrymen, lend me your ears!"  
⁠(They were all of them fond of quotations:  
So they drank to his health, and they gave him three cheers,  
⁠While he served out additional rations).

"We have sailed many months, we have sailed many weeks  
⁠(Four weeks to the month you may mark),  
But never as yet ('tis your Captain who speaks)  
⁠Have we caught the least glimpse of a Snark!

"We have sailed many weeks, we have sailed many days  
⁠(Seven days to the week I allow),  
But a Snark,  [of the like] we might lovingly gaze,  
⁠We have never beheld till now!

*And at that point, he started to describe the distinguishing features of a Snark: its bland taste. its habit of getting up late, and eating breakfast at tea-time, its inability to take a joke, its peculiar fondness for bathing machines, and its stong sense of ambition, or perhaps, lack of it.*

["Now, listen", he said,] it next will be right  
⁠To describe each particular batch:  
Distinguishing those that have feathers, and bite,  
⁠From those that have whiskers, and scratch.

"For, although common Snarks do no manner of harm,  
⁠Yet, I feel it my duty to say,  
Some are Boojums——" The Bellman broke off in alarm,  
⁠For the Baker had fainted away.

__Fit the Third.__

*THE BAKER'S TALE.*

*They did what they could to rouse him, broguht him muffins, and tea, and cucumber sandwiches, and even tried telling him riddles. When he eventually came rounnd, he started to tell them a sorrowful tale.*

*That started way, way back, with his parents...*

*"We've no time for that", the Bellman said. "If it gets dark we'll stand no chance of finding the Snark".*

*"I'll skip forty years, then" said the Baker, and with tears in his eyes, he continued his tale.*

"A dear uncle of mine (after whom I was named)  
⁠Remarked, when I bade him farewell—"  
"Oh, skip your dear uncle!" the Bellman exclaimed,  
⁠As he angrily tingled his bell.

"He remarked to me then," said that mildest of men,  
⁠" 'If your Snark be a Snark, that is right:  
Fetch it home by all means—you may serve it with greens,  
⁠And it's handy for striking a light.

"'You may seek it with thimbles—and seek it with care;  
⁠You may hunt it with forks and hope;  
You may threaten its life with a railway-share;  
⁠You may charm it with smiles and soap—'"  

("[Yes, yes, that's the way]," the Bellman bold  
⁠In a hasty parenthesis cried,  
"That's exactly the way [that I've] always been told  
⁠That the [hunting] of Snarks should be tried!")

"'But oh, beamish nephew, beware of the day,  
⁠If your Snark be a Boojum! For then  
You will softly and suddenly vanish away,  
⁠And never be met with again!'

"It is this, it is this that oppresses my soul,  
⁠When I think of my uncle's last words:  
And my heart is as nothing so much as a bowl  
⁠Brimming over with quivering curds!  

"It is this, it is this—" "[Yes, we've heard] that before!"  
⁠The Bellman indignantly said.  
And the Baker replied "Let me say it once more.  
⁠It is this, it is this that I dread!

*And then he told of how, in his dreams each night, he'd fight with the Snark, and with some success; but he was always fearful that one day it would turn out to be a Boojum, and that he'd simply just disappear away.*

__Fit the Fourth.__

*THE HUNTING.*

*The Bellman was rather put out by the Baker's comments — "Why didn't you tell us before? It's too late to do anything about it now...".*

*"I thought I did", was the Baker's reply. "I'm sure I told you the day we left — in Hebrew, and in Dutch, and German, and Greek, and.. oh... I forgot to say it in English, didn't I? I assume you don't speak anything other than English..?"*

*At this point, the Bellman went into something of a sulk at having his speech interrupted, and muttered something else about finishing it later. Because for now, they had to make ready to set out on the hunt.*

"To seek it with thimbles, to seek it with care;  
⁠To pursue it with forks and hope;  
To threaten its life with a railway-share;  
⁠To charm it with smiles and soap!

*And he explained how the Snark could not be caught in a commonplace way, and that the crew would have to try every trick in the book, as well as every trick not in the book, (these were the days before there were boxes to think out of) if they were to succeed.*

*At this point, the Banker signed and crossed a blank cheque, just in case, and the baker comberd his beard. The Boots and the Broker sharpening spades, and the Beaver just carried on making lace. The barrister started trying to explain just how good an advocate he was, and the Bonnet-maker worked on some attractive bows while the Billiard-marker chalked his nose.*

*The Butcher, however, seemed rather nervous and asked the Bellman if he would be so good, if they should meet the Snark together, to introduce them, and the Beaver smirked in contempt at his shyness.*

*"Man up" said the Bellman, as the Butcher started sobbing: "because you'll need all your strength if you happen to meet a Jubjub bird along the way...*

__Fit the Fifth.__

*THE BEAVER'S LESSON.*

They sought it with thimbles, they sought it with care;  
⁠They pursued it with forks and hope;  
They threatened its life with a railway-share;  
⁠They charmed it with smiles and soap.

*And they made their plans. The Butcher's plan was a cunning one— to go where no-one else would, into a small, desolate valley he could see, away in the distance. Which just happened to be the same plan as the Beaver's. They both set off, pretending to ignore the other, and with the afternoon turning to evening, both reached the valley at the same time. As it narrowed, they drew closer and closer together until they were walking shoulder to shoulder, each of them still pretending to ignore the other.*

Then a scream, shrill and high, rent the shuddering sky,  
⁠And they knew that some danger was near:  
The Beaver turned pale to the tip of its tail,  
⁠And even the Butcher felt queer.

He thought of his childhood, left far far behind—  
⁠That blissful and innocent state—  
[For the] sound so exactly recalled to his mind  
[The squeak of a pencil] on slate!

"'Tis the voice of the Jubjub!" he suddenly cried.  
⁠(This man, that they used to call "Dunce.")  
"As the Bellman would tell you," he added with pride,  
⁠"I have uttered [this] sentiment once.

"'Tis the note of the Jubjub! Keep count, I entreat;  
⁠You will find I have told it you twice.  
'Tis the song of the Jubjub! The proof is complete,  
⁠If only I've stated it thrice."

*The Beaver had been trying to keep count, but somehow fumbled its numbers at the last repetition, and decided it would have to try to start over again.*

*"Two plus one is, oh, why is it so difficult", sobbed the Beaver, and the Butcher took pity on it. "Calm down, just calm down. We can work it out," he said. "Now, get some paper, and a pen, and we'll work it through." And so the Beaver found some paper, and pen, and as the wild creatures watched, the Butcher began.*

*"Three is the number we're interested in, right? So, let's start with that; then add seven; and ten. Multiply out by a thousand diminished by eight; and then divide through by nine hundred and ninety two. If you then subtract seventeen, then we get to the nuimber we want: three. Exactly. And perfectly true."*

*I'd happily explain it", he said, "while I have it so clear in my head, and if I had the time, and if you had the brain. But, while I'm on a such a role, how about a Natural History lesson?" and at that point he started to lecture on the life and behaviour of the Jubjub bird. He would gladly have talked on the subject for hours, but eventually felt the lesson should end, and thanked the Beaver for being his friend. The Beaver replied in kind, and said it had never learned so much in it's whole life as it had just learned then. And from that day to this the Butcher and the Beaver became inseparable; and as they started walking again, they held each other's hands.*

*And I have to say, such a strong and loving friendship has never been known before or since. And if ever there was any tension between them, they'd just remember that day and all would be well again.*

__Fit the Sixth.__

*THE BARRISTER'S DREAM.*

They sought it with thimbles, they sought it with care;  
⁠They pursued it with forks and hope;  
They threatened its life with a railway-share;  
⁠They charmed it with smiles and soap.

*For the Barrister, well, he'd fallen into a fitful sleep, and the strangest of dreams. In which the Snark was dressed as a Barrister, and was defending a pig on a charge of deserting its own sty. So eloquent was its defence, the Snark had already been talking for over three hours, and the Jury still had no clue what it was talking about, or even what the trial was about, and each had a separate opinion on the matter.*

*"And so", said the Snark, "the pig is obviously innocent of treason, as well as insolvency, but as to desertion, that is indisputable, except for its alibi. And now you, the Jury must decide."*

*The Snark sat down and waited for the Judge to sum up. But the Judge admitted to never having summed up before, and so the Snark did it for him, so completely in fact he introduced far more evidence than had been presented originally.*

*The verdict was then called for, but as the Jury had trouble spelling it, they asked the Snark to give it for them.*

*"Guilty", shouted the Snark, and half the Jury fainted away. The Judge, being too nervous to pass sentence, left that to the Snark. too: "Transportation for life; and then a fine of forty pounds." And the Jury all cheered...*

but the Judge said he feared  
⁠That the phrase was not legally sound.

*Unfortunately, the cheers were brought to an end when the Jailer admitted that the sentence would not have the slightest effect, because the pig had actually been dead for some years. Such was the speed of justice in those times.*

*And such was the dream of the Barrister. At least, that is, until he was rudely awoken by the angrily ringing bell of the Bellman.*

__Fit the Seventh.__

*THE BANKER'S FATE.*

They sought it with thimbles, they sought it with care;  
⁠They pursued it with forks and hope;  
They threatened its life with a railway-share;  
⁠They charmed it with smiles and soap.

[Now] the Banker, inspired with a courage so new  
⁠It was matter for general remark,  
Rushed madly ahead and was lost to their view  
⁠In his zeal to discover the Snark.

But while he was seeking with thimbles and care,  
⁠A Bandersnatch swiftly drew nigh  
And grabbed at the Banker, who shrieked in despair,  
⁠For he knew it was useless to fly.

He offered large discount—he offered a cheque,  
⁠(Drawn "to bearer") for seven-pounds-ten:  
But the Bandersnatch merely extended its neck  
[As he] grabbed at the Banker again.

Without rest or pause—[whilst] those frumious jaws  
⁠Went savagely snapping around—  
He skipped and he hopped, and he floundered and flopped,  
[Until] fainting, he fell to the ground.

[Now,] the Bandersnatch fled, as the others appeared  
[Driven] on by that fear-stricken yell:  
And the Bellman remarked "It is just as I feared!"  
[As he] solemnly tolled on his bell.

*They all gathered round the Banker. He was black in the face, and was barely recognisable; his shock was so great that his waistcoat, as well as his hair, had turned completely white. And lookimg just like he was wearing full evening dress, he stood up, and gibbered at them, because he had completely lost his mind. Then he sat down again, and brushed his fingers through his hair, and gently rocked himself backwards and forwards, muttering to himself.*

*"We must leave him", said the Bellman, "we must leave him. Time is running out. And if we don't get a move on, we won't catch the Snark before nightfall."*

__Fit the Eighth.__

*THE VANISHING.*

They sought it with thimbles, they sought it with care;  
⁠They pursued it with forks and hope;  
They threatened its life with a railway-share;  
⁠They charmed it with smiles and soap.

*The whole crew were fearful that the hunt might now end without success. But with the light failing, the Beaver suddenly called out. "Look, look, isn't that thing-um-a-bob [the Baker], there, there, over there on that crag. It looks like he's waving, it looks like he's shouting, it looks like he....has he? Has he caught a Snark? What, wait, where's he gone?*

*And the next thing they knew, it appeared as if the Baker had plunged off the crag and into a deep, dark chasm.*

*And they strained to listen.*

"It's a Snark!" was the sound that first came to their ears,  
[It] seemed almost too good to be true.  
[There then] followed a torrent of laughter and cheers:  
[And] the ominous words "It's a Boo—"

Then, silence. Some fancied they heard in the air  
⁠A weary and wandering sigh  
That sounded like "—jum!" but the others [declared]  
⁠It was only a breeze that went by.

They hunted till darkness came on, but they found  
⁠Not a button, or feather, or mark,  
By which they could tell that they stood on the ground  
⁠Where the Baker had met with the Snark.

In the midst of [that] word he was trying to say,  
⁠In the midst of his laughter and glee,  
He had softly and suddenly vanished away—  
⁠For the Snark was a Boojum, you see.

THE END.
