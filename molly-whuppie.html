<h1>Molly Whuppie<a class="headerlink" href="#molly-whuppie" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h1>
<p>If ever there’s a story I’ve seen told “by storytellers” as a children’s story, at least in recent years, it’s probably <em>Molly Whuppie</em>. Perhaps one reason for this is that it is packed with recognisable elements: a poor family whose children must leave; a clever girl outwitting a giant; a giant tricked into killing his own children; a person tricked into replacing someone in a sack (<em>Hudden and Dudden</em>, <em>Little Fairly</em>), and so on.</p>
<p>The version that’s found in Jacobs’ <em>English Fairy Tales</em> is a bit all over the place, and I don’t really find it very satisfactory at all. Of the versions I’ve found to date,  I prefer Kennedy’s <em>Hairy Grouchy</em>, and Campbell’s “Maol a Chliobain” (<em>Popular Tales of the West Highlands, vol I</em>). These are also pretty close to the version I heard Daniel Morden tell in a kids’ session at <em>Beyond the Border, 2023</em>, if I recall correctly? <em>(Daniel Morden’s selections and tellings very often resonate strongly for me…)</em></p>
<div class="dropdown admonition">
<p class="admonition-title"><em>Hairy Rouchy</em>, Patrick Kennedy, 1870</p>
<p>In <em>The fireside stories of Ireland</em>, Patrick Kennedy, 1870, <a class="reference external" href="https://archive.org/details/firesidestories00kenngoog/page/n18/mode/2up">p3-9</a>:</p>
<p>HAIRY ROUCHY.</p>
<p>There was once a widow woman, as often there was, and she had three daughters. The eldest and the second eldest were as handsome as the moon and the evening star, but the youngest was all covered with hair, and her face was as brown as a berry, and they called her Hairy Rouchy. She lighted the fire in the morning, cooked the food, and made the beds, while her sisters would be stringing flowers on a hank, or looking at themselves in the glass, or sitting with their hands across. “ No one will ever come to marry us in this lonesome place,” said the eldest one day ; “ so you and I,” said she to the second sister, “ may as well go seek our fortune.” “ That’s the best word you ever spoke,” said the other. “Bake our cake and kill our cock, mother, and away we go.” Well, so she did ; “ And now, girls,” said she, “ which will you have, half this with my blessing, or the whole of it with my curse ?” “ Curse or no curse, mother, the whole of it is little enough.”</p>
<p>Well they set off, and says Hairy Rouchy to her mother when they got to the end of the lane, “Mother, give me your blessing, and a quarter of the griddle cake, I must go after these girls, for I fear ill luck is in their road.” she gave her her blessing and the whole of the cake, and she went off running, and soon overtook them. “ Here’s Hairy Rouchy,” says the eldest, “ she’ll make a show of us. We’ll tie her to this big stone.” so they tied her to the big stone and went their way, but when they were a quarter of a mile further, there she was three perches behind them. Well, they were vexed enough, and the next clamp of turf they passed, they made her lie down, and piled every sod of it over her.</p>
<p>When they were a quarter of a mile further they looked back again, and there was the girl three perches behind them, and went they mad ! To make a long story short, they fastened her in a pound, and they put the tying of the three smalls on her, and fastened her to a tree. The next quarter of a mile she was up by their side, and at last they were tired, and let her walk behind them.</p>
<p>Well, they walked and they walked till they were tired, and till the greyness of night came round them, and they saw a light at a distance. When they came up, what was it but a giant’s house, and great sharp teeth were in the heads of himself and his wife, and his three daughters. Well, they got lodging, and when sleep time was coming they were put into one bed, and the giant’s daughters were put into another, and the foot of the daughters’ bed touched the head of theirs. Well becomes my brave Hairy Rouchy, — when the giant’s daughters were asleep, she took off the hair necklaces from her own neck and the necks of her sisters, and put them on the giant’s daughters’ necks, and she put their gold and silver and diamond necklaces on the necks of her sisters and herself, and then watched to see what would happen.</p>
<p>The giant and his wife were sitting by the fire, and says he, “ Won’t these girls make a fine meat pie for us to-morrow ?” “ Won’t they !” says she, and she smacked her lips, “but I’ll have some trouble singeing that hairy one.” “ They are all asleep now,” says he, and he called in his redheaded giolla “ Go and put them strangers out of pain,” says he. “ But how’ll I know them from your daughters ?” says the giolla. “Very easy, they have only hair necklaces round their necks.”</p>
<p>Well, you may all guess what happened. So the night faded away, and the morning came, and what did the giant see at the flight of darkness, when the gate was opened by the cow-boy, but Hairy Rouchy walking out through it after her two sisters. Down the stairs he came, five at a time, and out of the bawn he flew, and <em>mach go brath</em> (away for ever) with him after the girls. The eldest screamed out, and the second eldest screamed out, but the youngest took one under each arm, and if she did’nt lay leg to ground, you may call me a story-teller. She ran like the west wind, and the giant ran like the north wind; the sparks of fire he struck out of the stones hit her on the back, and the sparks of fire she struck out of the stones scorched his face. At last they came near the wide and deep river that divided his land from the land of the King of Spain, and into that land he daren’t pass. Over the wide deep river went Hairy Rouchy with a high, very active hound, and after her went the giant. His heels touched the bank, and hack into the water went his head and body. He dragged himself out on his own side, and sat down on the bank, and looked across, and this is what he said. “You’re there Hairy Rouchy,” says he. “No thanks to you for it,” says she. “ You got my three daughters killed.” says he, “ It was to save our own lives,” says she. “ When will you come to see me again ?” says he. “ When I have business,” says she. “ Divel be in your road !” says he. “ It’s better pray than curse,” says she.</p>
<p>The three girls went on till they came to the King of Spain’s castle, where they were well entertained, and the King’s eldest son and the eldest sister fell in love with one another, and the second son and the second sister fell in love with one another, and poor Hairy Rouchy fell in love with the youngest son, but he did’nt fall in love with her.</p>
<p>Well, the next day, when they were at breakfast, says the King to her, “ Good was your deed at the giant’s house, and if you only bring me the talking golden quilt that’s covering himself and his wife, my eldest son may marry your eldest sister.” “ I’ll try,” says she ; “ worse than lose I can’t.”</p>
<p>So that night, when the giant and his wife were fast asleep, the quilt felt a hand pulling it off the bed. “ Who are you ? “ says the quilt. “ <em>Mishé</em> “ (myself), says the girl, — and she pulled away. “ Waken, master ! “ says the quilt ; “ some one is taking me away.” “ And who’s taking you away ?” says he. “ It’s Mishe that’s doing it,” says the quilt. “ Then let Mishe stop his tricks, and not be disturbing us. “ But I tell you, Mishe is carrying me off.” “ If Mishe says another word, I’ll get up, and throw him in the fire.” So the poor quilt had nothing to do but hold its tongue.</p>
<p>“ But,” says the giant’s wife, after a few minutes, “maybe the divel bewitcht the quilt to walk off with itself.” “ Faith and maybe so,” says the giant ; “ I’ll get up and look.” so he searched the room, and the stairs, and the hall, and the bawn, and the bawn gate was open. “ <em>Milé mollachd</em>,” says he ; “ Hairy Rouchy was here ;” and to the road he took. But when he was on the hill she was in the hollow, and when he was in the hollow she was on the hill, and when he came to the hither side of the river she was on the thither. “ You’re there, Hairy Rouchy !” says he. “ No thanks to you,” says she .” “ You took away my speaking golden quilt,” says he. “It was to get my eldest sister married,” says she. “When will you come again ?”  … “ Divel be in your road,” says he. “ If s better pray than curse,” says she ; and the same night the speaking golden quilt was covering the King and Queen of Spain.</p>
<p>Well, the wedding was made, but there was little notice taken of poor Hairy Rouchy, and she spent a good part of the day talking to a poor travelling woman that she often relieved at home and that was come by <em>accidence</em> as far as Spain.</p>
<p>So the next day, when they were at breakfast again, says the King, “ Hairy Rouchy, if you bring me to-morrow morning the <em>chloive solais</em> (sword of light) that hangs at the giant’s bed’s head, my second son will marry your second sister.” “ I’ll make the trial,” says she ; “ worse than lose I can’t.”</p>
<p>Well, the next night the giant’s wife was boiling his big pot of gruel, and Hairy Rouchy was sitting by the <em>chimbly</em> on the scraws that covered the ridge-pole, and dropping fistfuls of salt into the pot. “ You put too much salt in this porridge,” says the giant to his wife, when he was supping it. “ I’m sure I did’t put in more than four spoonfuls,” says she. “ Well, well, that was the right size ; still it tastes mortial salty.”</p>
<p>When he was in bed he cried out, “ Wife, I’ll be a piece of cured bacon before morning if I don’t get a drink.” “ Oh, then, purshuin to the sup of water in the house,” says she. “ Well, call up the giolla out of the settle, and let him bring a pailful from the well.” So the giolla got up in a bad humour, scratching his head, and went to the door with the pail in his hand. There was Hairy Rouchy by the jamb, and maybe she didn’t dash fistfuls of sand and salt into his eyes. “ Oh masther, masther,” says he, the sky is as black as your hat, and it’s pelting hailstones on me ; I’ll never find the well.” “ Here you onshuch, take the sword of light, and it will show you the way.”</p>
<p>So he took the chloive solais, and made his way to the well, and while he was filling the pail he laid the sword on the ground. That was all the girl wanted. She snatched it up, waved it round her head, and the light flashed over hills and hollows. “ If you’re not into the house like a shot,” says she, “ I’ll send your head half a mile away.” The poor giolla was only too glad to get off, and she was soon flying like the wind to the river, and the giant hot foot after her. When she was in the hollow he was on the hill. …</p>
<p>“ You’re a very good girl, indeed,” says the King of Spain to Hairy Rouchy, the morning after the second marriage; “you deserve a reward, so bring me the giant’s puckawn with the golden bells round his neck, as soon as you like, and you must get my youngest son for a husband. “ But maybe he wont have me,’ says she. “ Indeed an’ I will,” says the prince ; “ so good a sister can’t make a bad wife.” “ But I’m all hairy and brown,” says she. “ That’s no sin,” says the prince.</p>
<p>Sure enough, the night after, she was hard and fast in the giant’s out-house, stuffing the puckawn’s bells with the marrow of the elder ; and when she thought the job was well finished she was leading him out. She had a band on his mouth, but when my brave puck found he couldn’t bawl, he took to rear and kick like a puck as he was. Out came the elder marrow from three of the bells, and the sound that came from them was enough to waken the dead. She drove him at his full speed before her, but after came the giant like a storm. She could escape him if she liked, but she would not return without puck, and bedad she was soon pinned and brought back to the giant’s big kitchen. There was his wife and the giolla, and if he wasn’t proud to show them his prisoner there’s not a glove in Wexford.</p>
<p>“ Now, ma’am,” says he to her, “ I have you safe after all the mischief you done me. If I was in your power what would you do to me ?” “ Oh wouldn’t I tie you up to the ceiling in a sack, you ould tyrant, and go myself and giolla to the wood, cut big clubs, and break every bone in your body one after another. Then if there was any life left in you, we’d make a fire of the green boughs underneath, and stifle the little that was left out of you.” “ The very thing I’ll do with you,” says he.</p>
<p>So he put her in a sack, tied her up to the beam that went across the kitchen, and went off with the the giolla to the wood to cut down the clubs and green branches, leaving his wife to watch the prisoner. She expected to hear crying and sobbing from out of the sack, but the girl did nothing but shout and laugh. “ Is it mad you are,” says she, “ and death so near you ? “ “ Death indeed ! Why, the bottom of the sack is full of diamonds, and pearls, and guineas, and there is the finest views all round me you ever see — castles, and lawns, and lakes, and the finest flowers.” “ Is it lies you’re telling ?” “ Oh dickens a lie ! If I’d let you up, but I won’t, you’d see and feel it all.”</p>
<p>But the giant’s wife over-persuaded her, and when she was loosened, and got the other into the sack, she tied her hard and fast, ran to the out-house, threw a rope round the puckawn’s neck, and he and she were soon racing like the wind towards the river. The giant and the giolla were soon back, and he wondered where his wife could be. But he saw the sack still full, and the two began to whack it like so many blacksmiths. “ Oh Lord,” says the poor woman, “ it’s myself that’s here.” “ And to be sure it’s yourself,” says he ; “ here goes again.” But she roared out, “Ah sure I’m your wife ; don’t kill me for goodness’ sake ! “ “ Be the laws, “says the giolla, “ it’s the mistress. Oh, bad luck to you, Hairy Rouchy ; this is your doing. Run and catch her, master, while I take the poor mistress down, and see what I can do for her.” Off went the big fellow like a bowarra, but when he came to this side of the river panting and puffing, there was the girl and his darling puckawn on the other side, and she ready to burst her sides with the laughing.</p>
<p>“ You’re there, my damsel.” “ No thanks, etc.” so the scolding match went on to the end, and then says he, “ If you were in my place, and I in yours now, what would you do ? “ “ I’d stoop down and drink the river dry to get at you.” But she didn’t stop to see whether he was fool enough to take her advice, but led her goat to the palace. Oh, wasn’t there great joy and clapping of hands when the golden bells were heard a ringing up the avenue, and into the big bawn ? she didn’t mind how any one looked but the youngest prince ; and though he didn’t appear very rejoiced, there was a kind smile on his face, and she was satisfied.</p>
<p>Well, the next morning, when they were all setting out to the church, and the bridegroom was mounted on his horse, and the bride getting into the coach, she asked him for leave to take the poor travelling woman in along with her. “ It’s a queer request,” says he, “but do as you like ; you must have some reason for it.” Well, when all were dismounting or getting out of their coaches, he went to open the door for his bride, and the sight almost left his eyes ; for there sitting <em>fornent</em> him was the most beautiful young woman he ever beheld. She had the same kind innocent look that belonged to Hairy Bouchy, but she had also the finest colour in her face, and neck, and hands, and her hair, instead of the tangled brake it used to be, was nicely platted and curled, and was the finest dark brown in the world.</p>
<p>Glad enough she was to see the joy and surprise in his face, and if they were not the happy bride and bridegroom I never saw one. When they were talking by themselves, she told him that an enchantment was laid on her when she was a child, and she was always to remain the fright she was, till some one would marry her for the sake of her disposition. The travelling woman was her guardian fairy in disguise. There were two unhappy marriages and one happy one in the King of Spain’s family, and I’ll let every one here guess which was which.</p>

<p>NOTES, p163</p>
<p>Hairy Rouchy ; p. 3.</p>
<p>The <em>ch</em> in the surname of this heroine must get a guttural sound as in all Irish words where it occurs, c and G never get the soft sound which belongs to them in such English words as <em>rancid</em>, <em>gem</em>, &amp;c. In the tying of the three smalls, her waist, her wrists, and her legs above the ancles were secured.</p>
<p>In several of the household narratives of Teuton and Celt there was a profusion of bloodshed, and very small regret for maiming or killing outright. Were our labours of a purely archaeological nature, we should not spare our readers a single horror of the many with which this class of fireside traditions abound. But we prefer cultivating for our little selection a popularity among folk whose joys are many, and years few, and to whom even the rough Juvenal declared that the greatest reverence should be paid. Therefore let our critics forgive us for using some of our materials with reserve, and relating deeds of cutting, thrusting, and gashing “ with a difference.”</p>
<p>Some forms of this present tale are of a decidedly truculent character. There is a variety of it in Campbell’s West Highland Tales under the title of <em>Maol a Chliobain</em>, and another in Dasent’s Norse Tales, where the heroine is called <em>Tatterhood</em>.</p>
<p>The professional story-tellers delighted in verbal repetitions at different points of the story, nor did even the good Homer despise them. They afforded intervals of rest. Economy of space is essential to our design and therefore we cannot indulge in them. However, when these stories are read out for children it will be found advisable to give all these repetitions without stint. The <em>Mishé</em> of the heroine will remind scholars of the <em>Outis</em> [no one] of <em>Odysseus</em>.</p>

<p>XVIL MAOL A CHLIOBAIN.</p>
<p>From Ann MacGilvray, Islay.</p>
<p>THERE was a widow ere now, and she had three daughters ; and they said to her that they would go to seek their fortune. She baked three bannocks. She said to the big one, “Whether dost thou like best the half and my blessing, or the big half and my curse? “ “I like best,” said she. “the big half and thy curse.” she said to the middle one, “Whether doet thou like best the big half and my curse, or the little half and my blessing?” “I like best,” said she, “the big half and thy curse.” she said to the little one, “ Whether dost thou like best the big half and my curse, or the little half and my blessing ? “ I like best the half and thy blessing.” This pleased her mother, and she gave her the two other halves also. They went away, but the two eldest did not want the youngest to be with them, and they tied her to a rock of stone. They went on ; but her mother’s blessing came and freed her. And when they looked behind them, whom did they see but her with the rock on top of her. They let her alone a turn of a while, till they reached a peat stack, and they tied her to the peat stack. They went on a bit (but her mother’s blessing came and freed her) and they looked behind them, and whom did they see but her coming and the peat stack on top of her. They let her alone a turn of a while, till they reached a tree, and they tied her to the tree. They went on a bit (but her mother’s blessing came and freed her), and when they looked behind them, whom did they see but her, and the tree on top of her.</p>
<p>They saw it was no good to be at her ; they loosed her, and let her (come) with them. They were going till night came on them. They saw a light a long way from them ; and though a long way from them, it was not long that they were in reaching it They went in. What was this but a giant’s house ! They asked to stop the night. They got that, and they were put to bed with the three daughters of the giant. (The giant came home, and he said, “ The smell of the foreign girls is within.”) There were twists of amber knobs about the necks of the giant’s daughters, and strings of horse hair about their necks. They all slept but Maol a Chliobain did not sleep. Through the night a thirst come on the giant. He called to his bald, rough-skinned gillie to bring him water. The bald, rough-skinned gillie said that there was not a drop within. “ Kill,” said he, “ one of the strange girls, and bring to me her blood.” “How will I know them?” said the bald, rough-skinned gilliei “ There are twists of knobs of amber about the necks of my daughters, and twists of horse hair about the necks of the rest.”</p>
<p>Maol a Chliobain heard the giant, and as quick as she could she put the strings of horse hair that were about her own neck and about the necks of her sisters about the necks of the giant’s daughters ; and the knobs that wore about the necks of tho giant’s daughters about her own neck and about the necks of her sisters ; and she laid down so quietly. The bald, rough-skinned gillie came, and he killed one of the daughters of the giant, and he took the blood to him. He asked for MORE to be brought him. He killed the next. He asked for more ; and he killed the third one.</p>
<p>Maol a Chliobain awoke her sisters, and she took them with her on top of her, and she took to going. (She took with her a golden cloth that was on the bed, and it called out.)</p>
<p>The giant perceived her, and he followed her. The sparks of fire that she was putting out of the stones with her heels, they were striking the giant on the shin ; and the sparks of fire that the giant was bringing out of the stones with the points of his feet, they were striking Maol a Chliobain in the back of the head. It is this was their going till they reached a river. (She plucked a hair out of her head and made a bridge of it, and she run over the river, and the giant could not follow her.) Maol a Chliobain leaped the river, but the river the giant could not leap.</p>
<p>“ Thou art over there, Maol a Chliobain.” “ I am, though it is hard for thee.” “ Thou killedst my three bald brown daughters.” “ I killed them, though it is hard for thee.” “ And when wilt thou come again ? “  “I will come when my business brings me.”</p>
<p>They went on forward till they reached the house of a farmer. The farmer had three sons. They told how it happened to them. Said the farmer to Maol a Chliobain, “ I will give my eldest son to thy eldest sister, and get for me the fine comb of gold, and the coarse comb of silver that the giant has.” “ It will cost thee no more,” said Maol a Chliobain.</p>
<p>She went away ; she reached the house of the giant ; she got in unknown ; she took with her the combs, and out she went. The giant perceived her, and after her he was till they reached the river. She leaped the river, but the river the giant could not leap. “ Thou art over there, Maol a Chliobain.” “ I am, though it is hard for thee.” “Thou killedst my three bald brown daughters.” “ I killed them, though it is hard for thee.” “ Thou stolest my fine comb of gold, and my coarse comb of silver.” “ I stole them, though it is hard for thee.” “ When wilt thou come again ? “  “I will come when my business brings me.”</p>
<p>She gave the combs to the farmer, and her big sister and the farmer’s big son married. “ I will give my middle son to thy middle sister, and get me the giant’s glave <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[TH</span> <span class="pre">(WP):a</span> <span class="pre">European</span> <span class="pre">polearm,</span> <span class="pre">consisting</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">a</span> <span class="pre">single-edged</span> <span class="pre">(short)</span> <span class="pre">blade</span> <span class="pre">on</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">end</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">a</span> <span class="pre">pole.]</span></code> of light” “ It will cost thee no more,” said Maol a Chliobain. She went away, and she reached the giant’s house ; she went up to the top of a tree that was above the giant’s welL In the night came the bald rough-skinned gillie with the sword of light to fetch water. When he bent to raise the water, Muol a Chliobain came down and she pushed him down in the well, and she drowned him, and she took with her the glave of light.</p>
<p>The giant followed her till she reached the river ; she leaped the river, and the giant could not follow her. “ Thou art over there, Maol a Chliobain.” “ I am, if it is hard for thee.” “ Thou killedst my three bald brown daughters.” “I killed, though it is hard for thee.” “ Thou stolest my fine comb of gold, and my coarse comb of silver.” “ I stole, though it is hard for thee.” “ Thou killedst my bald rough-skinned gillie.” “ I killed, though it is hard for thee.” “Thou stolest my glave of light.” “ I stole, though it is hard for thee.” “ When wilt thou come again ? “ “I will come when my business brings me.” she reached the house of the farmer with the glave of light ; and her middle sister and the middle son of the farmer married. “ I will give thyself my youngest son,” said the farmer, “and bring me a bock that the giant has.” “ It will cost thee no more,” said Maol a Chliobain. She went away, and she reached the house of the giant ; but when she had hold of the buck, the giant caught her. “ What?” said the giant, “ wouldst thou do to me ; if I had done as much harm to thee as thou hast done to me, I would make thee burst thyself with milk porridge ; I would then put thee in a pock ; I would hang thee to the roof-tree ; I would set fire under thee ; and I would set on thee with clubs till thou shouldst fall as a faggot of withered sticks on the floor.” The giant made milk porridge, and he made her drink it. She put the milk porridge about her mouth and face, and she laid over as if she were dead. The giant put her in a pock, and he hung her to the roof-tree ; and he went away, himself and his men, to get wood to the forest. The giant’s mother was within. When the giant was gone, Maol a Chliobain began— “ Tis I am in the light ! Tis I am in the city of gold ! “ “ Wilt thou let me in ?” said the carlin. “ I will not let thee in.” At last she let down the pock. She put in the carlin, cat and calf and cream-dish. She took with her the buck and she went away. When the giant came with his men, himself and his men began at the bag with the clubs. The carlin was callings “ “Tis myself that’s in it” “ I know that thyself is in it,” would the giant say, as he laid on to the pock. The pock came down as a faggot of sticks, and what was in it but his mother. When the giant saw how it was, he took after Maol a Chliobain ; he followed her till she reached the rirer. Maol a Chliobain leaped the river, and the giant could not leap it. “ Thou art over there, Maol a Chliobain” “I am, though it is hard for thee. “ Thou killedst my three bald brown daughters.” “ I killed, though it is hold for thee.” “Thou stolest my golden comb, and my silver comb.” “I stole, though it is hard for thee.” “ Thou killedest my bald rough-skinned gillie.” “I killed, though it it hard for thee.” “ Thou stolest my glave of light.” “ I stole, though it is hard for thee.” “ Thou killedst my mother.” “ I killed, though it is hard for thee.” “ Thou stolest my buck.” “I stole, though it it hard for thee.” “ When wilt thou come again ?” “ I will come when my business brings me.” “ If thou wurt over here, and I yonder,” said the giant, “ what wouldst thou do to follow me ? “ “ I would stick myself down, and I would drink till I should dry the river.” The giant stuck himself down, and he drunk till he burst. Maol a Chliobain and the farmer’s youngest son married.</p>

<p>It’s from Jacobs that we seem to get the commonly used <em>Molly Whuppie</em> name, which he coined from the original <em>Mally Whuppie</em> source tale reprinted from the <em>Folk-Lore Journal</em> of 1884:</p>

<p>Molly Whuppie</p>
<p>ONCE upon a time there was a man and a wife had too many children, and they could not get meat for them, so they took the three youngest and left them in a wood. They travelled and travelled and could see never a house. It began to be dark, and they were hungry. At last they saw a light and made for it; it turned out to be a house. They knocked at the door, and a woman came to it, who said : “ What do you want ?” They said : “ Please let us in and give us something to eat.” The woman said : “ I can’t do that, as my man is a giant, and he would kill you if he comes home.” They begged hard. “ Let us stop for a little while,” said they, “ and we will go away before he comes.” so she took them in, and set them down before the fire, and gave them milk and bread ; but just as they had begun to eat a great knock came to the door, and a dreadful voice said :</p>
<p>“ Fee, fie, fo, fum,<br />
I smell the blood of some earthly one.</p>
<p>Who have you there wife?” “Eh,” said the wife, “it’s three poor lassies cold and hungry, and they will go away. Ye won’t touch *em, man.”</p>
<p>He said nothing, but ate up a big supper, and ordered them to stay all night. Now he had three lassies of his own, and they were to sleep in the same bed with the three strangers. The youngest of the three strange lassies was called Molly Whuppie, and she was very clever. She noticed that before they went to bed the giant put straw ropes round her neck and her sisters’, and round his own lassies’ necks he put gold chains. So Molly took care and did not fall asleep, but waited till she was sure every one was sleeping sound. Then she slipped out of the bed, and took the straw ropes off her own and her sisters’ necks, and took the gold chains off the giant’s lassies. She then put the straw ropes on the giant’s lassies and the gold on herself and her sisters, and lay down. And in the middle of the night up rose the giant, armed with a great club, and felt for the necks with the straw. It was dark. He took his own lassies out of bed on to the floor, and battered them until they were dead, and then lay down again, thinking he had managed fine. Molly thought it time she and her sisters were out of that, so she wakened them and told them to be quiet, and they slipped out of the house. They all got out safe, and they ran and ran, and never stopped until morning, when they saw a grand house before them. It turned out to be a king’s house : so Molly went in, and told her story to the king. He said : “ Well, Molly, you are a clever girl, and you have managed well ; but, if you would manage better, and go back, and steal the giant’s sword that hangs on the back of his bed, I would give your eldest sister my eldest son to marry.” Molly said she would try. So she went back, and managed to slip into the giant’s house, and crept in below the bed. The giant came home, and ate up a great supper, and went to bed. Molly waited until he was snoring, and she crept out, and reached over the giant and got down the sword ; but just as she got it out over the bed it gave a rattle, and up jumped the giant, and Molly ran out at the door and the sword with her; and she ran, and he ran, till they came to the “ Bridge of one hair “ ; and she got over, but he couldn’t, and he says, “ Woe worth ye, Molly Whuppie ! never ye come again.” And she says : “ Twice yet, carle,” quoth she, “ I’ll come to spain.” so Molly took the sword to the king, and her sister was married to his son.</p>
<p>Well, the king he says : “ Ye’ve managed well, Molly ; but if ye would manage better, and steal the purse that lies below the giant’s pillow, I would marry your second sister to my second son.” And Molly said she would try. So she set out for the giant’s house, and slipped in, and hid again below the bed, and waited till the giant had eaten his supper, and was snoring sound asleep. She slipped out, and slipped her hand below the pillow, and got out the purse ; but just as she was going out the giant wakened, and ran after her ; and she ran, and he ran, till they came to the “ Bridge of one hair,” and she got over, but he couldn’t, and he said, “ Woe worth ye, Molly Whuppie ! never you come again.” “ Once yet, carle,” quoth she, “ I’ll come to spain.” so Molly took the purse to the king, and her second sister was married to the king’s second son.</p>
<p>After that the king says to Molly : “ Molly, you are a clever girl, but if you would do better yet, and steal the giant’s ring that he wears on his finger, I will give you my youngest son for yourself.” Molly said she would trj so back she goes to the giant’s house, and hides hersei below the bed. The giant wasn’t long ere he came home and, after he had eaten a great big supper, he went to hi; bed, and shortly was snoring loud. Molly crept out anc reached over the bed, and got hold of the giant’s hand, and she pulled and she pulled until she got off the ring ; but just as she got it off the giant got up, and gripped her by the hand, and he says : “ Now I have catcht you, Molly Whuppie, and, if I had done as much ill to you as ye have done to me, what would ye do to me ?”</p>
<p>Molly says : “ I would put you into a sack, and I’d put the cat inside with you, and the dog aside you, and a needle and thread and a shears, and I’d hang you up upon the wall, and I’d go to the wood, and choose the thickest stick I could get, and I would come home, and take you down, and bang you till you were dead.”</p>
<p>“Well, Molly,” says the giant, “Til just do that to you.”</p>
<p>So he gets a sack, and puts Molly into it, and the cat and the dog beside her, and a needle and thread and shears, and hangs her up upon the wall, and goes to the wood to choose a stick.</p>
<p>Molly she sings out : “ Oh, if ye saw what I see.”</p>
<p>“ Oh,” says the giant’s wife, “ what do ye see, Molly?”</p>
<p>But Molly never said a word but, “ Oh, if ye saw what I see!”</p>
<p>The giant’s wife begged that Molly would take her up into the sack till she would see what Molly saw. So Molly took the shears and cut a hole in the sack, and took out the needle and thread with her, and jumped down and helped the giant’s wife up into the sack, and sewed up the hole.</p>
<p>The giant’s wife saw nothing, and began to ask to get down again ; but Molly never minded, but hid herself at the back of the door. Home came the giant, and a great big tree in his hand, and he took down the sack, and began to batter it. His wife cried, “ It’s me, man ; “ but the dog barked and the cat mewed, and he did not know his wife’s voice. But Molly came out from the back of the door, and the giant saw her, and he after her ; and he ran and she ran, till they came to the “ Bridge of one hair,” and she got over but he couldn’t ; and he said, “ Woe worth you, Molly Whuppie ! never you come again.” “ Never more, carle,” quoth she, “ will I come again to spain.”</p>
<p>So Molly took the ring to the king, and she was married to his youngest son, and she never saw the giant again.</p>

<p>In his notes to the tale, Jacobs gives elements of Perrault’s <em>Hop o’ my Thumb</em> as a cognate tale, and <em>Hairy Rouchy</em> as a providing a Celtic origin for <em>Molly Whuppie</em>:</p>

<p>Parallels. — The first part is clearly the theme of “ Hop o’ my Thumb,” which Mr. Lang has studied in his “ Perrault,” pp. civ.-cxi. (cf. Köhler, Occident, ii. 301.) The change of night-dresses occurs in Greek myths. The latter part wanders off into “ rob giant of three things,” a familiar incident in folk-tales (Cosquin, i. 46-7), and finally winds up with the “out of sack” trick, for which see Cosquin, i. 113 ; ii. 209 ; and Köhler in <em>Occident und Orient</em> ii. 489-506, on Campbell, No. xvii., Maol Chlioban, which was undoubtedly the source of our story. Kennedy’s <em>Fireside stories</em>, No. I, “Hairy Rouchy, “ is exactly similar, showing the story to be originally Celtic.</p>

<p>THREE FOLK-TALEs FROM OLD MELDRUM, ABERDEENsHIRE.</p>
<p>THE following folk-tales have been communicated to me by Mr. Moir, Rector of the Grammar school, Aberdeen. He had them from his mother, who kindly wrote out “ Mally Whuppie “ and “ The Red Calf” at my request.</p>
<p>Mally Whuppie.</p>
<p>Ance upon a time there was a man and a wife had too many children, and they could not get meat for them, so they took the three youngest and left them in a wood. They travelled and travelled and could see never a house. It began to be dark, and they were hungry. At last they saw a light and made for it; it turned out to be a house. They knocked at the door, and a woman came to it, who asked what they wanted. They said if she would let them in and gee them a piece. The woman said she could not do that, as her man was a giant, and he would fell them if he came home. They priggit that she would let them stop for a little whilie, and they would go away before he came. So she took them in, and set them doon afore the fire, and gave them milk and bread; but just as they had begun to eat a great knock came to the door, and a dreadful voice said: —</p>
<p>“ Fee, fie, fo, fum,<br />
I smell the blood of some earthly one.</p>
<p>Who have you there, wife ? “ “ Eh,” said the wife, “ it’s three peer lassies caul’ an hungry, an they will go away. Ye winna touch them, man.” He said nothing, but eat up a great big supper, and ordered them to stay all night. Now he had three lassies of his own, and they were to sleep in the same bed with the three strangers. The youngest of the three strange lassies was called Mally Whuppie, and she was very clever. She noticed that before they went to bed the giant put straw rapes round her neck and her sisters’, and round his ain lassies’ necks he put gold chains. So Mally took care and did not fall asleep, but waited till she was sure every one was sleeping sound. Then she slippit out of the bed, and took the straw rapes off her own and her sisters’ necks, and took the gold chains off the giant’s lassies. She then put the straw rapes on the giant’s lassies and the gold on herself and her sisters, and lay down. And in the middle of the night up rose the giant, armed with a great club, and felt for the necks with the straw. It was dark. He took his own lassies out on the floor, and laid upon them until they were dead, and then lay down again, thinking he had managed fine. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[J.</span> <span class="pre">Leite</span> <span class="pre">de</span> <span class="pre">Vascoiicellos,</span> <span class="pre">in</span> <span class="pre">Tradicoes</span> <span class="pre">populares</span> <span class="pre">de</span> <span class="pre">Portugal</span> <span class="pre">(pp.</span> <span class="pre">264,</span> <span class="pre">265),</span> <span class="pre">gives</span> <span class="pre">a</span> <span class="pre">version</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">this</span> <span class="pre">part</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">story,</span> <span class="pre">but</span> <span class="pre">it</span> <span class="pre">is</span> <span class="pre">a</span> <span class="pre">lobis-homem,</span> <span class="pre">or</span> <span class="pre">werewolf,</span> <span class="pre">that</span> <span class="pre">figures</span> <span class="pre">in</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">place</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">giant.]</span></code> Mally thought it time she and her sisters were out of that, so she wakened them and told them to be quiet, and they slippit out of the house. They all got out safe, and they ran and ran, and never stoppit until morning, when they saw a grand house before them. It turned out to be the king’s house; so Mally went in, and told her story to the king. He said, “Well, Mally, you are a clever cutty, and you have managed well ; but, if you would manage better, and go back, and steal the giant’s sword that hangs on the back of his bed, I would give your eldest sister my eldest son to marry.” Mally said she would try. So she went back, and managed to slip into the giant’s house, and crept in below the bed. The giant came home, and ate up a great supper, and went to bed. Mally waited until he was snoring, and she crept out, and raxed in ower the giant and got doon the sword ; but just as she got it oot ower the bed it gave a rattle, and up jumped the giant, and Mally oot at the door and the sword with her ; and she ran, and he ran, till they cam to the *’ Brig o’ ae hair” ; and she wan ower, but he cuddna, and he says, “ Wae worth ye, Mally Whuppie ! lat ye never come again.” And she says, “ Twice yet, carle,” quo she, “I’ll come to spain.” so Mally took the sword to the king, and her sister was married to his son.</p>
<p>“ Well,” the king he says: — “ Ye’ve managed well, Mally ; but if ye would manage better, and steal the purse tliat lies below the giant’s pillow, I would marry your second sister to my second son.” And Mally said she would try. So she set out for the giant’s house, and slippit in, and hid again below the bed, and waited till the giant had eaten his supper, and was snoring sound asleep. She slippit out, and slippit her hand below the pillow, and got out the purse; but just as she was going out the giant wakened, and after her; and she ran, and he ran, till they came to the “ Brig o’ ae hair,” and she wan ower, but he cuddna, and he said, “ Wae worth you, Mally Whuppie ! lat you never come again.” “ Ance yet, carle,” quo she, “ I’ll come to spain.” so Mally took the purse to the king, and her second sister was married to the king’s second son.</p>
<p>After that the king says to Mally, “ Mally, you are a clever cutty, but if you would dee better yet, and steal the giant’s ring that he wears on his finger, I will give you my youngest son to yoursel.” Mally said she would try. So back she goes to the giant’s house, and hides herself below the bed. The giant wizna lang ere he came hanie, and, after he had eaten a great big supper, he went to his bed, and shortly was snoring loud. Mally crept out, and raxed in ower the bed, and got hold of the giant’s hand, and she pirlt and pirlt until she got off the ring ; but just as she got it off the giant got up, and grippit her by the hand, and he says, “ Now I hae catcht you, Mally Whuppie, and, if I had deen as muckle ill to you as ye hae deen to me, what wad ye dee to me ? “</p>
<p>Mally considered what plan she would fall upon to escape, and she says, “ I wad pit you into a pyock, and I wad pit the cat inside wi’ you and the dog aside you, and a needle and thread and a shears, and I wad hang you up upon the wa’, and I wad gang to the wood, and wile the thickest stick I could get, and I would come hame, and take you down, and lay upon you till you were dead.”</p>
<p>“ Well, Mally,” says the giant, “ I’ll just do that to you.” so he gets a pyock, and puts Mally into it, and the cat and the dog beside her, and a needle and thread and shears, and hings her up upon the wa’, and goes to the wood to choose a stick. Mally she sings, “ Oh, gin ye saw faht I see.” “ Oh,” says the giant’s wife, “ faht divv ye see, Mally ?”</p>
<p>But Mally never said a word but, “ Oh, gin ye saw falit I see ! “ The giant’s wife pleaded that Mally would take her up into the pyock till she would see what Mally saw. So Mally took the shears and cut a hole in the pyock, and took out the needle and thread with her, and jumpt down, and helpit the giant’s wife up into the pyock, and sewed up the hole.</p>
<p>The giant’s wife saw nothing, and began to ask to get down again; but Mally never minded, but hid herself at the back of the door. Home came the giant, and a great big tree in his hand, and he took down the pyock, and began to lay upon it. His wife cried, “ It’s me, man;” but the dog barkit and the cat mewt, and he did not know his wife’s voice. But Mally did not want her to be killed, so she came out from the back of the door, and the giant saw her, and he after her; and he ran, and she ran, till they came to the “Brig o’ ae hair,” and she wan ower, but he cuddna ; and he said, “ Wae worth you, Mally Whuppie! lat you never come again,” “ Never mair, carle,” quo she, “ will I come again to spain.”</p>
<p>So Mally took the ring to the king, and she was married to his youngest son, and she never saw the giant again.</p>

<p>Tale: Once upon a time, there was a married couple who had three children. On a winter occasion, they were hungry and had nothing to give to their children. So, they took them to a forest and left them there. It was almost night, and the children, when they found themselves alone, walked along a path through the forest. They saw a light in the distance and headed towards it. It was a small house inhabited by a werewolf and a woman. The werewolf had known, and the woman fed the children and put them to bed in a room where she also had three daughters, each of whom always slept with a hood on their heads. This was to distinguish them from other children who came there, so the werewolf, when he came, wouldn’t eat those who had hoods, which were his daughters. When the werewolf arrived, the woman had prepared a good dinner for him to fill him up and not harm the children. He began to say that he smelled human flesh there, and the woman said to him, “Eat, eat, it’s nobody, and go to sleep as you’re tired.” He did just that and went to sleep. Late at night, he got up, went to the room, and looked for the children, killing and eating those who didn’t have hoods. The little ones, who had taken the hoods from the werewolf’s daughters, thus escaped death. While the werewolf was eating the daughters by mistake, they fled. In the morning, the werewolf and the woman looked for their daughters but couldn’t find them. Then they remembered what the boys might have done and, to get revenge, the werewolf put on seven-league boots to catch them faster. With a giant stride, he went further ahead and left them behind. When he got tired, he lay down to sleep. While he slept, the children arrived, recognized him, and one of them took off his boots, put them on, carried his brothers on his back, and fled. They were back home in one stride. When the parents saw them, they were very happy. This ends the tale. The king summoned these children to his presence and rewarded them for their cleverness so they could live happily. The werewolf returned home and scolded the woman because she was the reason he lost his daughters and boots. “Victory, victory,” he said. The End. (Cumieira, County of Vila Real).</p>

<p>Here’s a short version of the tale of <em>Hop o’ my Thumb</em>, <em>circa 1880</em>; it includes an episode where the “giant” kills his own offspring:</p>

<p class="admonition-title"><em>Hop o’ my Thumb</em>, Perrault, c.1880</p>
<p>Charles Perrault, <em>Hop o’ my Thumb</em>, <a class="reference external" href="https://archive.org/details/hopomythumb00perriala/mode/2up">edition c. 1880</a>:</p>
<p>A VERY poor couple once lived in a village near a wood, where they used to work; but as they had a family of seven little children, all boys, they could hardly manage to get food enough. The least boy was so tiny that he was called Hop o’ my Thumb; but though so small, he was very clever. One night, when all the children were lying in bed, their parents were crying sadly, because there was no food in the house ; and Hop o ? my Thumb was quite in a fright, when he heard them say, that they would take all their little ones into the wood next day, and there leave them, that they might not see them die of hunger. So he got up very early in the morning, and filled his pockets with pebbles; and when he and his brothers went into the wood, he dropped the stones one by one as he walked along, and by this means, when it was getting dark, they found the way home again. But the next time the poor couple took their children to the wood, the little fellow could not get pebbles, for he had been locked up all night, and had nothing but a few crumbs to drop on the road, and these the birds soon ate up. The wind howled, and the min fell, and the poor children thought they should all perish; but they still kept moving on, in the hope of getting help.</p>
<p>Hop o’ my Thumb kept a good look out, and at last he saw a light not far off. So he cheered up his brothers, and on they went, till they reached a large house, from which the light was seen to come. After they had knocked at the door, a pleasantlooking dame opened it; and Hop o’ my Thumb told how they had lose their way in the wood, and were very tired and hungry. As soon as she heard their story, she told them to go away as fast as they could, because her husband, who was an <em>Ogre</em>, and very fond of eating children, would soon be home. But they all cried so much, and begged so hard for food and shelter, that at last she let them in.</p>
<p>The Ogre’s wife had only just time to hide the poor children, when the <em>Ogre</em> came in, and ordered her to lay the cloth, and bring in some sucking-pigs for his supper. Just as he began to use his great carving-knife and fork, he cried out, gruffly, “I smell child’s flesh!” His wife said it was onlv the freshly killed calf; but he was not to be put off so easily, and, on looking about, he found the poor boys under the bed. The <em>Ogre</em> gave a look of fierce joy when he saw them, but he thought it better to fatten them up before he killed them; so he told his wife to give them some supper, and put them to bed, in the same room where his daughters were sleeping.</p>
<p>Hop o’ my Thumb, fearing mischief, could not sleep ; so he got out of bed, and, on looking about, saw that the <em>Ogre</em>’s daughters all had crowns on their heads; he then changed these for the nightcaps worn by his brothers and himself, and when the <em>Ogre</em> came up in- the dark, with his great knife to kill the poor boys, he cut the throats of his own children, instead! At peep of day, Hop o’ my Thumb awoke his brothers, and made them quickly get away with him from the house. After they were gone, the <em>Ogre</em>, grinning savagely, went up to the bed-room; but he became almost mad when he found he had killed his daughters, and the little boys were all gone.</p>
<p>The <em>Ogre</em> now put on his magic boots, with which he could take seven leagues at a stride, and set off in pursuit of the poor runaway boys; but Hop o’ my Thumb had made them all hide in a hole under a rock. By and by the <em>Ogre</em> came back tired and in a very bad humor, and threw himself on this very rock to sleep. A kind Fairy now appeared to the children, and gave Hop o’ my Thumb a nut to crack as soon as he should reach the <em>Ogre</em>’s house; but the Fairy told, him he must first take off the <em>Ogre</em>’s boots, and send his brothers home, and afterwards put on the magic boots himself, and make the best of his way to the <em>Ogre</em>’s house.</p>
<p>Hop o’ my Thumb, with the help of the kind Fairy, soon removed the <em>Ogre</em>’s seven-leagued boots while he was asleep, and put them on his own little legs; but as they were magic boots, they fitted him as well as the <em>Ogre</em>, just, indeed, as if they had been made for him. He now called his brothers out of the hole in the rock, and put them in the way to reach home. He then strode on in his magic boots, till he came to the <em>Ogre</em>’s house, and, on cracking the nut, he found inside a paper with these words:</p>
<p>“Go unto the Ogre’s door, These words speak, and nothing more;<br />
“ Ogress, Ogre can not come: Great key give to Hop o’ my Thumb.”</p>
<p>When the Ogre’s wife first saw Hop o’ my Thumb, she was ready to kill him for having caused the death of her daughters; but no sooner did he utter the magic words <em>Ogre</em>ss, Ogi^ can not come; Great key give to Hop o’ my Thumb.</p>
<p>than she gave him the key of the gold chest, and told him to take as much as he chose. When he saw the great heap of money in the chest, he thought, like a good subject, he should like to help the King to some of the treasure , and so he made the <em>Ogre</em>’s wife give him as many bags full of gold as he could take away in several journeys.</p>
<p>While Hop o’ my Thumb was so well employed in taking away the wicked <em>Ogre</em>’s treasure, that monster was still sleeping, after his useless journey in search of the poor children, on the rock, where Hop o’ my Thumb left him When he awoke, and found his magic boots gone, and his limbs so stiff tha he could not move, he made a hideous noise, which aroused all the wild beasts of the forest, and they all liew at him in great fury, and gored him to death.</p>
<p>Hop o’ my Thumb now went to Court, laden with his hard won spoil, and paid his respects to the King, who did him the favor to accept of his rich gifts, and rewarded him by making him his Head Forester, and his father and brothers foresters under him; and whenever the King went out hunting, the little fellow used to ride by his side. on a pretty, high-spirited little horse, with rich velvet clothing. The <em>Ogre</em>’s kind-hearted wife was also invited to Court, and created Dutchess of Dollalolla; and she shared the rest of her husband’s wealth with Hop o’ my Thumb, who was greatly beloved by all for his spirit and good sense; indeed, his Majesty at last dubbed him a Knigb f and made him his chief Privy Councilor, saying, that as he had been always so shrewd and clever in helping his brothers, he must surely be able to give him good advice whenever he might need it.</p>

<p>Little Poucet and his two Brothers</p>
<p>TALE VIII.</p>
<p>THERE was once upon a time a man and his wife, who made faggots for their livelihood, they had seven children. The eldest was but ten years old, and the youngest but seven. People were amazed, that the faggat-maker had so many children in so small a time; but it was because his wite went quick about ber business, and brought never less than two at a time. They were very poor, and their seven children incommoded them very much ; because not one of them was able to get his bread. That which gave them even yet more uneasiness, was, that the youngest was of a very tender constitution, and scarce ever spoke a word, which made them take that for stupidity, which was a sign of good sense; he was very little, and was no bigger when he was born than one’s thumb, which made him be called <em>Little Poucet</em>, which, signifies little Thumb.</p>
<p>The poor child bore the blame of every thing that was done amiss in the, house, and he was always in the wrong: he was, notwithstanding all this, more cunning, and had a far greater share of wit dom than all his brothers put together; and if he spoke little, he heard and thought the more.</p>
<p>THERE happen’d now to come a very bad year, and. the famine was so great, that these poor people resolved to rid themselves of their children. One evening, when they were all in bed, and the faggotmaker was sitting with his wife at the fire, he said to her, with his heart ready to break with grief, Thou seest, <em>Mary</em>, that we cannot keep our children, and I cannot see them die before my face; I am resolved to lose them in the wood to morrow, which may very easily be done; for while they are busy in tying up the faggots, we may run away, and leave them, without their taking the least notice. Ah! cried. out his wife, and canst thou thyself, <em>Nicholas</em>, have the heart to take the children out along with on purpose to lose them? In vain did her husband represent to her their extreme poverty, she would not consent to it ; she was poor it was true, but she was their mother. However, having considered what a grief it would be to her to see them die with hunger, she at last consented, and went to bed all in tears.</p>
<p><em>Little Poucet</em> heard every thing that was said; for having understood, as he lay in his bed, by some certain words, what they were talking of, he got up very softly, and slid himself under his father’s stool, that he might hear what they said, without being seen himself. He went to bed again, but did not sleep a wink all the rest of the night, thinking on what he had to do. He got up early in the morning, and went to the river’s side, where he filled his pockets full of small white pebbles, then returned home. They all went abroad, but <em>Little Poucet</em> never told his brothers one syllable of what he knew. They went into a very thick forrest, where they could not see one another at ten feet distance. The Faggot-maker began to cut wood, and the children to gather up the branches to make faggots. Their father and mother seeing them busy at their work, got from them insenfibly, and then ran away from them all at once, thr bushes. When the children saw they were left alone, they began to cry as loud as they could. <em>Little Poucet</em> let them cry on, knowing very well how to get home again; for as he came out, he dropt all along the way the little white pebbles he had in his pockets. Then he said to them, don’t be afraid, Brothers, Father and Mother have left us here, but I’ll bring you home again, only follow me; they did so, and he brought them home by the very same way that they came into the forrest: they dared not go in, but sat themselves down at the door, to hear what their Father and Mother said.</p>
<p>The very moment that the Faggot-maker and his Wife came home, the lord of the manour sent them ten crowns which he had owed them a long while, and which they never expected to see. This gave them new life; for the poor people were dying for hunger. The Faggot-maker sent his Wife immediately to the butchers. As it was a long while since they had eaten any thing, they bought three times as much meat as would sup two people: When they had eaten their fill, his wife said, Alas! where are now our poor children? they would make a good feast of what we have left; but as it was you, <em>Nicholas</em>, who had a mind to lose them, I told you we should repent of it, what are they now doing in the forrest? Alas! dear God, the wolves have eaten them up: thou hast been very inhumane thus to have lost thy children.</p>
<p>THe Faggot-maker grew at last extremely angry, for she repeated it above twenty times, that they should repent of it, and that she was in the right of it for so saying. He threatened to beat her, if she did not hold her tongue. It was not that the Faggot-maker was not perhaps more sorry than his Wife, but that she continually terized him, and that he was of the humour of a great many others, who love those wives who speak well, but think those very importunate that have always done so. She was all in tears: Alas! where are now my children, my poor children? she spoke this once, so very loud, that the children who were at the door, began to cry out altogether, Here we are, here we are: she ran immediately to open the door, and said to them as she kissed them, I am glad to see you, my dear children, you are very hungry and weary; and <em>Billy</em>, you are very dirty, come in and let me clean you. Now, you must know, that <em>Billy</em> was her eldest son, which she loved above all the rest, because he was somewhat red-hair’d, as she herself was. They fat down to supper, and eat with such an appetite as pleased both father and mother, to whom they told how much afraid they were in the forrest, speaking almost always all together, This good couple were extremely glad to see their children once more at home; and this joy continued as long as the ten crowns lasted; but when the money was all gane, they fell again into their sormer uneasiness, and resolved to lose them once more; and that they might be the more certain of it, to carry them at a much greater distance than they had done before. They could not talk of this so secretly, but <em>Little Poucet</em> heard it, who made account to get out of this difficulty as well as the former; but though he got up very betimes. in the morning, to go and pick up some little pebbles, he was disappointed ; for the door of the house was double-locked. He was at a stand what to do; when their Father had given each of them a piece of bread for their breakfast, he fancied he might make use of his piece in stead of the pebbles, by throwing it in little bits all along the way they should pals ; he put it up therefore very close into his pocket. Their Father and Mother brought them into the thickest and most obscure part of the forrest, and when they were there, they got to a by-path, ng left them there. <em>Little Poucet</em> was not uneasy at it; for he thought he could very easily find the way again, by means of his bread which he had scattered all the way he went; but he was very much surprized, when he could not find so much as one crumb; the birds came and had eaten it up every bit. They were now in a great deal of trouble; for they wandered still more and more out of their way, and were more and more bewildered in the forrest.</p>
<p>Night now came on, and there arose a very great wind, which made them dreadfully afraid ; they fancied they heard on every side of them the howling of wolves that were coming to eat them up; they scarce dared to speak or turn their heads. After this, it rained very hard, which wetted them to the skin ; their feet flipped at every step they took, and they fell into the mire, whence they got up in a very dirty condition, and were forced to go upon all four. <em>Little Poucet</em> climbed up to the top of a tree, to see if he could discover any thing having turned his head about on every side, he saw at last a glimmering light, as it were of a candle, but a long way from the forrest: he came down, and then he could see nothing of it; which made him very comfortless. However, having walked for some time with his brothers towards that fide on which he had seen the light; he perceived it again when they came out of the wood.</p>
<p>They came at last to a house - where this candle was, not without abundance of fear for very often they lost sight of it, which happened every time they came into a bottom. They knocked at the door, and a good woman came and opened it; she asked them what they would have; <em>Little Poucet</em> told her, they were poor children, that had been lost in the forrest, and desired to lodge there for God’s sake. The woman seeing them so very pretty, began to weep, and said to them, Alas! poor children, whence came ye; do you know that this house belongs to an <em>Ogre</em>, that eats up little children? Ah! dear Madam, answered <em>Little Poucet</em>, who trembled every joint of him, as well as his brothers, what shall we do? it is most certain, that the wolves of the forrest will not fail to eat us to night, if you refuse us to lie here; and this being so, we would rather the gentleman your husband should eat us, and perhaps he may take pity upon us, especially if you intercede with Him. The <em>Ogre</em>’s wife, who believed she could conceal them from Her husband till the morning, let them come in, and brought them into the kitchen, that they might warm themselves at a very good fire; for there was a whole sheep upon the spit roasting for the <em>Ogre</em>s supper. As they began to warm themselves, they heard three or four great raps at the door; this was the <em>Ogre</em> that was come home. Upon this she hid them under the bed, and went to open the door. The <em>Ogre</em> then asked if supper was ready, and the wine drawn, and then sat himself down to table. The sheep was as yet all raw and bloody; but he liked it the better for that. He fsaiffed upon the right hand and upon the left, saying, he smelt fresh meat; what you smell so, said his wife, must be the calf which I have just now killed and flead. I smell fresh meat, I tell thee once more, replied the <em>Ogre</em>, looking crossly at his wife, and there is something here that I don’t understand ; as he {poke these words, he got up from the table, and went directly to the bed. Ah, ha! faid he, I see then how thou would’st cheat me, thou cursed woman, I don’t know why I don’t eat up thee too, but thou art an old beast. Here is good game that comes very luckily to entertain three <em>Ogre</em>s of my acquaintance, who are to come to see me in a day or two. The poor children fell upon their knees, and begged his pardon, but they had to do with one of the most cruel <em>Ogre</em>s in the world, who, far from Having any pity on them, had already devoured them with his eyes, and told his wife, they would be delicate eating, when tossed up with an anchovie, and caper sauce, He then took a great knife, and coming up to these poor children, whetted it upon a great whet-stone that he had in his lest hand. He had already taken hold of one of them, when his wife said to him, what need you do it now? is it not time enough to morrow ? Hold your prating, said the <em>Ogre</em>, they will eat the tenderer. But you have so much victuals already, replied his wife, you have no occalion; here is a calf, two sheep, and half a hog. That is true, said the <em>Ogre</em>, give them their belly full, that they may not fall away, and put them to bed.</p>
<p>THE good woman was overjoy’d at this, and gave them a good supper, but they were so much afraid, they could not eat a bit. As for the <em>Ogre</em>, he sat down again to drink, being highly pleased that he had gotten wherewithal to treat his friends. He drank a dozen glasses more than ordinary, which got up into his head, and obliged him to go to bed.</p>
<p>THE <em>Ogre</em> had seven daughters, all little children, and these little <em>Ogre</em>ses had all of them very fine complexions, because they used to eat fresh meat like their father; but they had little grey eyes and intirely round, hooked noses, very large mouths, and very long sharp teeth, standing at a pretty distance from each other. They were not yet very wicked, but they promised it very much, for they had already bitten several little children, that they might suck their blood. They were put to bed very early, and they lay all seven in a great bed, with every one a crown of gold upon her head. There was in the same chamber another bed of the same bigness, and it was into this bed the <em>Ogre</em>’s wife put the seven little boys, after which she went to bed to her husband. <em>Little Poucet</em>, who had observed that the <em>Ogre</em>’s Daughters had crowns of gold upon their heads, and was afraid lest the <em>Ogre</em> should repent his not killing of them, got up about midnight; and taking his brothers bonnets and his own, went very softly, and put them npon the heads of the seven little <em>Ogre</em>sses, after having taken off their crowns of gold, which he put upon his own head and his brothers, that the <em>Ogre</em> might take them for his daughters, and his daughters for the little boys that he had a mind to kill. All this succceded according to his desire; for the <em>Ogre</em> waking a little after, and sorry he deferred to do that till the morning, which he might have done over night, he threw himself hastily out of bed, and taking his great knife, Let us see, said he, how our little rogues do, and not make two jobs of the matter. He then went up, groping all the way mto his daughters chamber; and coming up to the bed where the little boys lay, and who were every soul of them fast asleep, except <em>Little Poucet</em>, who was terribly afraid when he found the <em>Ogre</em> feeling about his head, as he had done about his brothers. The <em>Ogre</em>, who felt the crowns of gold, said, I should have made a fine piece of work of it truly, I find I have taken too much of the bottle last night, that is certain. Then he went to the bed where the girls lay; and having felt the boys little Bonnets. Hah ! said he, my merry little lads, are you there? let us work hard; and saying these words, he cut, without more ado, the throats of all his seven little daughters. Well pleased with what He had done, he went to bed again to his wife. As soon as <em>Little Poucet</em> Heard the <em>Ogre</em> snore, he waked his brothers, and bad them put on their clothes presently and follow him: they stole down softly into the garden, and got over the wall. They kept running almost all night, and continually trembled, without knowing which way they went. THE <em>Ogre</em>, when he awoke, said to his wife, Go up stairs, and dress the little rogues that - came here last night: the <em>Ogre</em>/s was very much surprized at this goodness of her husband, not dreaming after what manner he intended she should dress them ; but thinking that he had ordered her to go and put on their clothes, went up, and was very much surprized, when she perceived her seven daughters killed, and weltering in their own blood. She fainted away; for this is the first expedient almost all women find in the like misfortunes. The <em>Ogre</em> fearing his wife would be too longin doing what he had commanded her, went up himself to help her. He was no less astonished than his wite, at this frightful spectacle. Ah! what have I done? cried he, the cursed; rogues shall pay for it, and that presently too. He threw then a pitcher of water upom his wife’s face; and having brough Her to herself, give me quickly said he, my boots of seven leagues, that I may go and catch them. He went out into the high way; and having run over a great deal of ground both on this side and that ; he came at last into the very road where the poor children were, who were not above an hundred paces from their father’s house. They spied the <em>Ogre</em>, who went at one step from mountain to mountain, and over rivers as easily as the narrowest gutters, <em>Little Poucet</em> seeing a hollow rock near the place where they were, made his brothers hide themfelves in it, and crept into it himself, minding always what would become of the <em>Ogre</em>.</p>
<p>The <em>Ogre</em>, who found himself very weary, after so long a journey, to no manner of purpose (for these same boots of seyen leagues, fatigue their man very much) had a great mind to rest himself, and by chance went to fit down upon the rock where these little boys had hidden themselves. As it was impossible he could be more wearythan he was, he fell asleep;. and. after reposing himself some time,, began to snore so frightfully, that the poor children were no less afraid of him, than when he held up his great knife, and was going to: cut their throats. <em>Little Poucet</em> was: not so much frightened as his brothers, and told them, that they should run away immediately towards home, while the <em>Ogre</em> slept so soundly, and that they should: not be in any pain about him.</p>
<p>They took his advice, and got home presently. <em>Little Poucet</em> came up to the <em>Ogre</em>, pulled off his boots, and put them upon his own legs; the boots were very long and large; but as they were Fairies, they were capabale of growing big and and little, according to the legs of those that wore them ; so that they fittted his feet and legs as well as if they had been made on purpose for tim. He went immediately to the <em>Ogre</em>’s house, where he saw his wife crying bitterly for the loss of her children that were murdered.</p>
<p>Your husband, said <em>Little Poucet</em>, is in very great danger, being taken by a gang of thieves, who have sworn to kill him, if he does not give them all his gold and silver. The very moment they Held their daggers at his throat, he perceived me, and desired me to come and tell you the condition He is in, and that you should give me every thing he has that is valuable, without exception; for otherwise they will kill him without mercy : and as his case is very pressing, he desires me to make use (you see I have them on) of his boots of seyen leagues, that. I might make the more haste, and to shew you that I do not impose upon you.</p>
<p>THE good woman being very much affrighted, gave him all she had: for this <em>Ogre</em> was a very good husband, — he used to eat up little children. <em>Little Poucet</em> having thus gotten all the <em>Ogre</em>’s money, came home to his father’s house, where he was received with a great deal of Joy.</p>
<p>THERE are a great many Authors, who do not agree in this last circumstance, and pretend, that <em>Little Poucet</em> never robbed the <em>Ogre</em> of his cash, and that he only thought he might very equitably, and according to good conscience, take off his boots of seven leagues, because he made use of them for no other end, but to run after little children. These Gentlemen fay, that they are very well assured of this, and the more, as having drank and eaten often at the Faggotmaker’s house. They say further, that when <em>Little Poucet</em> had taken off the <em>Ogre</em>s boots, he went to Court, where he was informed that they were very much in pain about an army that was two hundred leagues off, and the success of a battle. He went, say they, to the King, and told him, that if he desired it, he would bring him News from the army before night. The King promised him a great sum of money upon that condition. Litile Poucet was as good as his word, and returned that same very night with the news; and this first expedition causing him to be known, he ot whatever he pleas’d; for the King paid him very well for carrying his orders to the army, and abundance of ladies gave him what: he would to bring them news from their lovers; and that this was his greatest gain. ‘There were some married women too, who sent Lets ters by him to their husbands, but they paid him so ill, that it was not worth his while, and turned to no manner of account. Aster having for some time carried on the business of a messenger, and gained thereby a great deal of money, he went home to his father, where it was impossible to express the joy they were all in at his return. He made the whole family very easy, bought places for his father and brothers; and by that means settled them very handsomely in the world, and in the mean time made his own court to perfection.</p>
<p>The Moral</p>
<p>AT many children parents dont repine<br />
If handsome, and their wits and Judgments shine,<br />
Ploite in carriage, and in body strong,<br />
Graceful in mien, and elegant in tongue.<br />
But if one of them prove perchance ; but weak,<br />
Him they despise, laugh at, defraud and cheat.<br />
Such is the wretched world’s curs’d way; and yet<br />
Sometimes this little despicable thing,<br />
This poor Marmot, which so despised wwe see,<br />
By unforeseen Events shall honour bring<br />
And happy weal to all the family.</p>
