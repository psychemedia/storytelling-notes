THE EFFECTS OF KISSING THE BRIDE. At the wedding of Mr. Amadell and Miss Aiken, at Kiantone, near Jamestown, N. Y., a few weeks ago, the bride, being popular and pretty, was kissed by a score of her friends. She had a slight sore throat at the time, and now both she and nearly all who availed themselves of the privilege of giving her a bridal salute are down with diphtheria.

53. The Test

There was once a beggar who sat at the foot of a bridge and asked for alms from the passersby. Every day a rich young merchant stopped to throw him a few para [Turkish coin]. One day the merchant had a larger shipment than usual and did not have enough money to pay the caravan owners. As he went to borrow the necessary funds from some friend or other, he was preoccupied. He passed the bridge, forgetting to give a few cents to the beggar.

The beggar, seeing that the young man passed him, was surprised. "Why didn't he give me money? Is something wrong?" the beggar said to himself. "Young man, come back, come back!" he stood up and shouted. The merchant turned around and came back. "Why did you forget to give my money today?" the beggar asked.

"I was in a hurry and forgot," the merchant said, throwing a few para to the beggar.

"I don't want your money," the beggar said. "I just want to know why you forgot. What is the matter?" he asked.

"Well, if you must know, I have to get some money from my friends to pay a caravan owner," the young man said.

"How much do you want?"

"I want-," the young merchant replied.

"Come to my house tonight after dark, and I will give you the money," the beggar said. When the young man protested that the beggar had no funds, the beggar said, "Never mind; you come

o my house tonight and you'll have your money." And he gave the merchant directions to get to his house.

That night the merchant went to the beggar's house and, to his amazement, found that it was even more beautiful than the homes of his rich friends. A charming girl invited him in and made him comfortable. After she had served him Turkish coffee, the beggar came in. "Ah, you have come," he said to the merchant. "Daughter, bring me the money bag," he ordered. The daughter brought the money bag, and they counted out the amount of money that the merchant needed. "You can return this loan whenever you have the money. There is no need to hurry," the beggar said.

The merchant thanked them and went home. But at home he began thinking of the loveliness and grace of the beggar's daughter and realized that he had fallen in love with her. Several days later when he returned the money to the beggar, he asked to marry the girl. "Do you have a trade?" the beggar asked.

"You know that I am a merchant," the young man replied.

'Do you have a trade other than this?"

"No, that is the only kind of work I know," the young man replied.

"Then you cannot marry my daughter except on one condition." When the young man asked what this condition was, the beggar replied, "I want you to wear my clothes and sit at the foot of the bridge and beg for a day. If you do that, I will let you marry my daughter." As the merchant refused to do so, the beggar shrugged his shoulders, ending the discussion. But the merchant's love for the girl was so great that he went to her father again and this time agreed to beg for a day at the foot of the bridge.

The next morning, in old, worn-out clothes, the merchant sat at the foot of the bridge and begged alms of the passersby. Looking at him, they recognized him and knew that once he had been a rich man. Everyone felt pity for him and threw money into his lap. The merchant was bitterly embarrassed, but what could he do?

That night he went to the beggar's house and put the alms money on the table. "Well, son, you have done it, have you?" the beggar said, pushing the money toward the merchant. "I don't want the money; I just wanted to test you to see how much you loved my daughter. Now, I know that even if your business should fail, you would beg to support her," he said.

The young merchant and the beggar's daughter were married, and the beggar was pleased to see them happy.
