<h1>The Green Children of Woolpit<a class="headerlink" href="#the-green-children-of-woolpit" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h1>
<p>I don’t know if any of you are familiar with James Stephens’ fabulous Irish Fairy Tales, which I have in the form of a green covered paperback book? It retells many old Irish legends that date back between 500 and 1000 years when they were first written down, although many of them also continued going strong in the oral tradition. One of them, <em>Mongan’s Frenzy</em>, a tale that is too long for me to tell in its entirety just here, tells in part of a campaign that Mongan, a King of Ireland, waged on the King of Lochlann, the King of the men of the North, of the Norsemen, of the Vikings. One battle in particular did not go well for Mongan, a battle in which the King of Lochlann released a terrible, terrible weapon, a truly horrific thing, against the Irishmen; a weapon so effective that Mongan lost many of his men that day; a weapon the like of which we have not seen or heard of since, so devastating was it: a flock of venomous sheep. Sheep so vicious that the Irishmen could only escape them by climbing trees. And then wait for help to come.</p>
<p>It’s true… It really happened…</p>
<p>Now, that is not the story I’m going to tell here, but I was reminded of it when I came across this story. A story from the town of Woolpit, in Suffolk. Now when I first heard that name — <em>Woolpit</em> — I wondered where it had come from. I wondered if, perhaps, in times past, the King of Lochlann had invaded Suffolk, somewhere along the windswept shores of East Anglia, and brought with him a flock of venomous sheep, like some sort of Dark Ages tank division, to ravage the Suffolk plains. And that perhaps the good people of one of the villages thereabouts, not having any trees to climb, had hit upon the cunning plan of digging pits that the venomous sheep might fall into, like ancient tank traps.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it seems that is <em>not</em> the origin of the name. Although it’s not far off.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>As far as far local Woolpit historians would have you believe, named after Ulfketel (or Ulfyctel), counsellor to Aithelred the Unready, and Lord of the Eastern Angles, Ulfketel, who had helped defend East Anglia against Danish attack in the early 11th century. Ulfketel, a name of Scandinavian origin: from ulf, meaning wolf, and ketel: trap, though I have elsewhere seen it translated as helmet, which might give rise to an Old English name such as Wulfhelm, or cauldron: Wolf’s pot. There are so many ways you could take this!</p>
</div>
<p>At the time, so legend has it, the town was renowned for its wolf pits: deep pits dug on the outskirts of the town, lined with stone, baited with something meaty, a tasty piece of dead cow, perhaps, then covered with branches. Attracted by the smell of fresh meat, a wolf would approach, then fall into the pit, and be unable to climb out because of the steep sides.</p>
<p>Now, you may be thinking that none of that has anything to do with “green”. But you’d be wrong. Because once, long ago, in the county of Suffolk, in the town of Woolpit, a strange thing happened one harvest time. The folk were out in the in the fields, gathering the harvest, when they saw two young children walking towards them, two young children, a boy an a girl, not from those parts. No-one recognised them; no-one could understand the strange language they spoke; no-one had seen the like of the strange, if ragged, clothes they wore; and no-one could take their eyes off the children’s green skin.</p>
<p>The children had been tending their father’s flock. The light was, as it always was, a perpetual twilight. There was no sun to give any indication of how long they had been at their task — their bellies would tell them that - hunger would tell them when it was time to return home. Across the wide river, a world away: a land of light. In the distance, the children heard something, a noise not unlike the sound of bells — church bells — ringing. It led them to a cavern; they followed the sound; they followed the sound deeper, and deeper, into the cavern. And then, as they were about to come across the source of the sound, as they turned a corner, they were overcome by a light, a bright light, a light brighter then anything they had seen before. It dazzled them, they covered their eyes, they stumbled their way outside, not knowing where they were, what the source of this strange light was. By the time they had regained their senses, they could hear voices, strange voices, speech the like of which they had never heard before. And they saw people, dressed strangely; people, of the strangest pale cream colour. The children were led away, led into a strange house. By now, they were hungry. Really hungry. The people offered them … offered them something, gesturing to their mouths as if to eat; but it looked like no food they had ever eaten before. The days went by. The children became hungrier, and hungrier still. One day, when they were outside, in the pale light they were most comfortable with, before the great bright light that hurt their eyes so, appeared in the sky, they saw one of the strangers carrying a basket of green stalks - food! They grabbed several from the basket, broke them open. But there was no nurturing pulse inside them. The children cried. The stranger looked at them, picked one of the strange pods that hung from the sides of the stalk, and broke it open: inside, in the soft white down that filled the pod, a row of beans. Beans! The children grabbed them greedily: food, at last. For several days, they ate nothing else. But even so, the boy, the younger of the two, grew sick, grew sick with melancholy. Some ritual was performed over them by one of the strangers, using another, even stranger, language; but they boy sickened further, and died. The girl, however, started to thrive, began to accept the strange foods the strange people ate. Her green colour began to fade, and she came to look like them. She started to learn their language. She started to flirt with their boys. She developed something of a reputation. And she told them this story, that I have just told to you.</p>
<p>So, if you do ever happen to find yourself in the county of Suffolk, in the town of  Woolpit, look out for the village sign: a silhouette of a Wolf, of the Church, a pilgrim site of old, and two small children, hand in hand. And that is the end of my tale.</p>

<p><strong>De quodam puero et puella de terra emergentibus.</strong></p>
<p>Aliud quoque mirum priori non dissimile in Suthfolke contigit apud Sanctam Mariam de Wulpetes. Inventus est puer quidam cum sorore sua ab accolis loci illius juxta oram cujusdam foveae quae ibidem continetur, qui formam omnium membrorum caeteris homini bus similem habebant, sed in colore cutis ab omnibus mortalibus nostrae habitabilis discrepabant. Nam tota superficies cutis eorum viridi colore tingebatur. Loque lam eorum nullus intelligere potuit. Hi igitur ad  domum domini Ricardi de Calne cujusdam militis, ad ducti prae admiratione, apud Wikes, inconsolabiliter flebant. Panis ac caetera cibaria eis apposita sunt, sed nullis escis quae eis apponebantur vesci volebant, cum utique maxima famis inedia diutius cruciarentur,quia omnia hujusmodi cibaria incomestibilia esse credebant, sicut puella postmodum confessa est. Tandem cum fabae noviter cum stipitibus abscissae in domo asportarentur, cum maxima aviditate innuerunt ut de fabis illis sibi daretur. Quae corameisallatae, stipites aperiunt, non fabarum folliculos, putantes in concavitate stipitum fabas contineri. Sed fabis in stipitibus non inventis, iterum flere coeperunt. Quod ubi astantes animadverterunt, folliculos aperiunt,fabas nudas ostendunt, ostensis cum magna hilaritate vescuntur, nulla alia cibaria ex multo tempore penitus contingentes. Puer vero semper quasi languore depressus infra breve tempus moritur. Puella vero sospitate continua perfruens, ac cibariis quibuslibet assuefacta, illum prassinum colorem penitus amisit, atque sanguineam habi tudinem totius corporis paulatim recuperavit. Quae postmodum sacri baptismatis lavacro regenerata, ac per multos annos in ministerio praedicti militis, (sicut ab eodem milite et ejus familia frequenter audivimus,) commorata, nimium lasciva et petulans exstitit. Interrogata vero frequenter de hominibus suae regionis, asserebat quod omnes habitatores et omnia quae in regione illa habebantur viridi tingerentur colore, et quod nullum solem cernebant, sed quadam claritate fruebantur, sicut post solis occasum contingit. Interrogata autem quomodo in hanc terram devenisset cum puero praedicto, respondit, quia cum pecora sequerentur, devenerunt in quandam cavernam. Quam ingressi, audierunt quendam delectabilem sonum campanarum ; cujus soni dulcedine capti per cavernam diutius errando incedebant, donec ad exitum illius devenirent. Qui inde emergentes, nimia claritate solis et insolita aeris temperie, quasi attoniti et exanimes effecti, diu super oram speluncae jacuerunt. Cumque a supervenientium inquie tudine terrerentur, diffugere voluerunt, sed introitum speluncae minime reperire potuerunt, donec ab eis comprehenderentur.</p>

<p>“ANOTHER wonderful thing,” says Ralph of Coggeshall, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[As</span> <span class="pre">quoted</span> <span class="pre">by</span> <span class="pre">Picart</span> <span class="pre">in</span> <span class="pre">his</span> <span class="pre">Notes</span> <span class="pre">on</span> <span class="pre">William</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">Newbridge.</span> <span class="pre">We</span> <span class="pre">could</span> <span class="pre">not</span> <span class="pre">find</span> <span class="pre">it</span> <span class="pre">in</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">Collection</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">Histories,</span> <span class="pre">etc.,</span> <span class="pre">by</span> <span class="pre">Marténe</span> <span class="pre">and</span> <span class="pre">Durand,—the</span> <span class="pre">only</span> <span class="pre">place</span> <span class="pre">where,</span> <span class="pre">to</span> <span class="pre">our</span> <span class="pre">knowledge,</span> <span class="pre">this</span> <span class="pre">chronicler’s</span> <span class="pre">works</span> <span class="pre">are</span> <span class="pre">printed.]</span></code> “happened in Suffolk, at St. Mary’s of the Wolf-pits. A boy and his sister were found by the inhabitants of that place near the mouth of a pit which is there, who had the fit of all their limbs like to those of other men, but they differed in the colour of their skin from all the people of our habitable world; for the whole surface of their skin waa tinged of a green colour. No one could understand their speech. When they were brought as curiosities to the house of a certain knight, Sir Richard de Calne, at Wikes, they wept bitterly. Bread and other victuals were set before them, but they would touch none of them, though they were tormented by great hunger, as the girl afterwards acknowledged. At length, when some beans just cut, with their stalks, were brought into the house, they made signs, with great avidity, that they should be given to them. When they were brought, they opened the stalks instead of the pods, thinking the beans were in the hollow of them; but not finding them there, they began to weep anew. When those who were present saw this, they opened the pods, and showed them the naked beans. They fed on these with great delight, and for a long time tasted no other food. The boy, however, was always languid and depressed, and he died within a short time. The girl enjoyed continual good health; and becoming accustomed to various kinds of food, lost completely that green colour, and gradually recovered the sanguine habit of her entire body. She was afterwards regenerated by the laver of holy baptism, and lived for many years in the service of that knight (as I have frequently heard from him and his family), and was rather loose and wanton in her conduct. Being frequently asked about the people of her country, she asserted that the inhabitants, and all they had in that country, were of a green colour; and that they saw no sun, but enjoyed a degree of light like what is after sunset. Being asked how she came into this country with the aforesaid boy, she replied, that as they were following their flocks, they came to a certain cavern, on entering which they heard a delightful sound of bells ; ravished by whose sweetness, the went for a long time wandering on through the cavern, until they came to its mouth. When they came out of it, they were struck senseless by the excessive light of the sun, and the unusual temperature of the air; and they thus lay for a long time. Being terrified by the noise of those who came on them, they wished to fly, but they could not find the entrance of the cavern before they were caught.”</p>

<p>A slightly later, but still “near contemporary” (within a couple of generations) retelling of the tale is also provided by William of Newburgh:</p>
<p>The preface to that work provides some background to William of Newburgh’s <em>History</em>:</p>
<p>We can also contrast William of Newburgh’s account with Keightley’s summary, which immediately followed his translation of Ralph of Coggeshall:</p>

<p>This story is also told by William of Newbridge,<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[Guilielmi</span> <span class="pre">Neubrigensis</span> <span class="pre">Historia,</span> <span class="pre">sive</span> <span class="pre">Chronica</span> <span class="pre">Rerum</span> <span class="pre">Anglicarum.</span> <span class="pre">Oxon.</span> <span class="pre">1719,</span> <span class="pre">lib.</span> <span class="pre">i.</span> <span class="pre">c.</span> <span class="pre">27.]</span></code> who places it in the reign of King Stephen. He says he long hesitated to believe it, but he was at length overcome by the weight of evidence. According to him, the place where the children appeared was about four or five miles from Bury St. Edmund’s: they came in harvest-time out of the Wolf-pits ; they both lost their green hue, and were baptised, and learn English. The boy, who was the younger, died; but the girl married a man at Lenna, and lived many years. They said their country was called St. Martin’s Land, as that saint was chiefly worshiped there; that the people were Christians, and had churches; that the sun did not rise there, but that there was a bright country which could be seen from theirs, being divided from it by a very broad river.</p>
