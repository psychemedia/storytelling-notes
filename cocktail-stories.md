## The Sin-Eater of Ross

Intro - tradition of sin-eater, "a long, lean, ugly, lamentable, poor rascal who lived on the Rosse highway; when the corpse was brought out of the house, and laid on the bier, a loaf of bread was brought out, and delivered to the sin eater, over the corpse, as also a mazard bowl of maple, full of beer (which he was to drink up), and sixpence in money, in consideration whereof he took upon him, *ipso facto*, all the sins of the defunct, and freed him or her from walking after they were dead.


... __Such was the tradition of the sin-eater.__

*Drinks and plates.*

In old Ross, Alton Court, beneath Penyard Wood, before John Kyrle's time, young Clara Markey took a tumble, and the young gardener came to her aid; they fell in love, but her father did not approave and sort another suitor for her; a wedding was arranged. The body of the gardener was found in the river, and after the ministrations of the sin-eater, he was buried as a suicide, at the cross-roads by Cross-Corpse Street, with a stake through his heart, as was the custom of the time. The wedding proceeded, but Clara was distraught. She was confined to her room, but each evening would walk to the cross-roads to be with her beloved.

## The Leaves That Hung But Never Grew

The next tale I heard from Daniel Morden, a storyteller from Abergavenny who has travelled the world telling tales, and who found the origins of this next tale in book of Gypsy Tales originally collected by John Sampson at the start of the 20th century.

There was once a house, that had been known as a happy house. ...  *And as she started to tell her story, the young maid quietly placed a plate of food on the table beside the yound man, and alongside it, a drink.*

A young girl arrives at a sad house, where a boy weeps in forgetfulness, his fist clenched. She tells him a tale, of a young woman who dreams three thmes of the leaves that hung but never grew, and goes to seek her fortune. A cottage, and an old woman, her mistreated daughter inside, along with a chained boar; behind the cottage, a tree, branches bare save for seven leaves that hang from them; a chance remark to the boar, who tells her the woman is the witch; the girl takes the leaves, uses one (1) to restore the boar to manhood, one (2) to enchant the chair, the poker, and the broom. They flee, and are chased; a leaf is used to transform the pair into a duck and a pond (3), another to turn them into a flower and a bee (4), a third to turn them into a tree and an apple (5). They separate at a crossroads, taking one remaining leaf each. The boys retrun home, but he is greeted with a kiss and forgets everything. The girl uses her leaf against the witch, who is transformed into a boar. The girl goes home, where her mother has died, then back to the crossroads, but the boy is not there; she wanders comes across a village, hears a tale of a sad house and a young man; the boy looks up, drys his hands, opens his hand to reveal a leaf.

## Cunning Woman (of the Forest, Wye Valley, Monmouthshire, etc)

There are various possibilities including the following. But definitely wise women / cunning women, with public appropbation as a witch, will be the theme. My currrent thinking is Old Ellen, but this may change... I may also add in a traditional Jack tale, of a foolish Jack who visits the local wise woman to buy a pottle of brains, and the ensuing confusion until he marries a woman ("I've always heard a fool makes a good husband") who has enough brains for the both of them.

When I first came across traditional storyelling some thirty years or so ago, one of the first, if not *the* first tale teller who really caught my attention was an Irish storyteller and collector of tales, called Eddie Lenihan. If you've ever seen or heard him tell, you won't have forgotten him. Bearded, wild haired, he had — still has — a fierce energy about him. And amongst the hundreds of tales he tells, and the many — though not enough — tales I have heard him tell, are tales of cunning women. Witches, some might call them. But that wouldn't be right. These were wise women who knew a thing or two about how the world worked, of herbs and headology, as Terry Pratchett might say, of good common sense and a long memory of what before and what didn't. And a keen sense of what was going locally.

The cunning folk would rarely ask for payment directly, but often there would be some sort of consideration paid. Some food that was left as an offering, perhaps. Or a nice bottle of the firey stuff. Payment, in kind. And in return, the wise woman would provide some sort of answer: knowing advice, for example, a charm or a magical device — a hazel stick, a piece of iron; or maybe a herbal remedy, to be take with, or without, food, or to be worked up at home as some sort of medicinal cocktail or herbal tea.

*Drinks and plates.*

All the tales I heard, are true stories. I really heard them, or heard of them. I don't know if the following tale is still told, or remembered, in the Forest, but you can find elements of it in the old papers of the time.

This third of our tales tonight is a tale of a cunning woman, Old Ellen, who lived in the Forest at the turn of the last century, a hundred and twenty or so years ago.

At the turn of the last century, another family by the name of Markey were living ..
