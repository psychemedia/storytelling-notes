Two People have been taken up, and are now in Custody, for carrying on a treasonable Correspondence with France by the way of Oftend. One of the principal Agents in this Business, it ieems, was discovered by the good Conduct of the Captain, who gave a Packet of Letters to a Friend on Suspicion of foul play. One of the incloseed Letters was directed to the Governor of Cherburgh, with particular Instructions to him, not to let the Vessel come into Harbour, or any of the Men on board.

TREASONABLE CORRESPONDENCE WITH THE ENEMY.

The Person who has been taken into Custody for conveying Intelligence to the French, is not at present a Clerk in any of the public departments under government, having some Time ago quitted thie navy Office, where he held a place of considerable Trust and Responfibility. Upon giving up his Situation, his visits to the Office, under the pretence of seeing his late Colleagues, became very frequent; and the Clerks having always looked upon him as a very worthy and respectable Character, received him with the utmost Affability and Politeness; and had so great a Confidence in his Honor, as to leave him very often alone in the several Offices. Having thus possess himself of their good Opinion, and found an easy Acesss to the several Places, where the most important Papers of the Office were constantly locked up, the Traitor found means to furnish himself with the necessary Keys for getting at them. This being accomplished, his Practice was to take any Paper the Content of which would be of Service to the Enemy, and Copy it; which being done, it was re-conveyed to the Place it had been taken from. The Accounts which he generally copied for the Information of the Enemy, were the Reports received by the Office from the several royal Dock-Yards. These Papers were delivered into the Navy-Board once every Week, and contained a particular Account, not only of the Ships building, but also of the Progress made with each of them, together with a Report of the Quantity of Stores, &c. laid up for Service, distinguifhing each particular Yard. The Importance that Copies of these Papers must have been to the Enemy, must be too great and obvious, to require them to be pointed out. The Manner in which he was detected is as curious as it was fortunate, The Villain, in order to prevent bis being discovered, made it an invariable Rule, always to Copy the Reports received from the several Yards, in his own Hand-writing. As it frequently happens, the Precaution taken by him, proved the very Means of his Deteclion, for being one Day in a Hurry to return a Report from one of the Yards, after he had transdribed it, the Wretch, through a Mistake, or that Fatality, which more or less attends evety Man in the Commission of a Crime, in the Room of re-conveying the Report itself, to the Place he had taken it from, unfortunately for him, put up the very Copy written by himself, in its stead, and sent the Original for the Use of the Enemy. It was impossible to get over this fatal accident. The Clerk of the Oflice, to whose Care the Reports were given, having Occasion soon after to resort to them presentiy discovered one to have been copied.

The Circumstances of these Reports having frequently been lost for several Days together, immediately rushed into his Mind, and the Handwriting of the Copy of the Report, found returned instead of the Original, being examined, it was soon perceived to have been written by the Person in custody, who, upon being sent for, and charged wirh having traiterously corresponded with the Court of France, immediately confessed the Crime, and implored Forgiveness. Such are the Particulars of this very extraordinary Transfaction. With respect to the Name of the Person, out of Pity to his Family, we will conceal it, at least for the present.

TYRIE's EXECUTION FOR HIGH TREASON.

Saturday Morning David Tyrie was brought from Winchester Gaol in a Coach and Six, accompanied by the Sheriff of Hants and his Attendants, he was met by the Officers and Constables of Portsmouth at the Green Post, and came in solemn Procession to the White-house, when he was taken out, and immediately put on a Hurdle with a Sledge, drawn by four Horses, and proceeded to South Sea Beach, where after some little Time spent in Reading, he suffered the whole Punishment according to the dreadful Sentence pronounced upon him.—We cannot help observing the Steadiness of Behaviour throughout the Whole, even from his Trial to his last Moments. The Annals of England cannot furnish a Circumstance wherein a Criminal launched into Eternity with so much Composure, not shewing the least Timidity, but seemed to think, to the last Moment, he acted in a right Cause. He said nothing material at the Place of Execution, nor gave the least Hint that any other Person was concerned with him. The Concourse of People assembled on this Occasion was great indeed; according to moderate Calculation, there could not be less than twenty thousand Persons. After hanging 22 Minutes and a Half, he was lowered down, his Heart was taken out and held up to the Populace, and the Hangman declared it to be the Heart of a Traitor: It was then thrown into the Fire, and his Body (the little Remains of it) was put into a Coffin, and buried near the Gallows.

It astonished every Spectator to see the horrid Inhumanity that was suffered on the remaining Part of the Carcase. The Populace had the Liberty of cutting and hacking any Part they thought proper, such as Fingers, Toes, and Ribs. This abominable Shock to human Nature, must certainly have been the Neglect of the Sheriff; and what was most palpable, to suffer the Gaoler of Gosport to take away Tyrie's Head, and which he is now making a Show of at his own Dungeon. Many of the Body-snatchers, as they are called, bid high for the Head; however, *Buck———* either having more Interest, or being quicker than the Rest, whipt it into a Bag, and some of his *worthy* Emisaries conveyed it away. It is sincerely to be hoped that such horrid Behaviour will not pass without exemplary Punishment.

The Crowd of People of all Ranks assembled by Four o'clock this Morning at the Gates of the Gaol, to see Tyrie set off for the Place of Execution, was very great. About Five o'Ciock he was put into a Coach with six Horses, attended by the Ordinary, Under-Sheriff, Gaoler, Sec. and conveyed to Portsmouth, where, being delivered up to the Mayor and Police of the Town, he was drawn on a Sledge the Place of Execution; after praying a little Time he was turned off, and hanging till almost dead, he was then cut down, his Head severed from his Body, his Bowels taken out, and his Heart shewn, to the surrounding Multitude, and then thrown into Fire made for the Purpose; the Body was then quartered and put into a Coffin.—The Concourse of People was immense, and beyond Description! and such was the Angular Avarice of many who were near the Body, that happy was he who could procure a Finger, or fome Vestige of the Criminal.—Tyrie supported to the last the same hardened Conduct as marked him his Condemnation, boldly leaping into the Coach at his leaving Winchester; and on his Journey to Portsmouth, his Words and Conduct, expressing great Indifference at his approaching Fate.

Stamford Mercury - Thursday 29 August 1782

By a Gentleman who arrived in town last night from Portfmouth, we are informed that David Tyrie, who was convicted at the lat Winchester assize, for holding a treasonable correspondence with the French Ministry, was taken from the prison of that city, early on Saturday morning last, to Portfmouwth, where he was executed on a gibbet erected for the purpofe, in the presence of an immense crowd of people. The unhappy man it is said behaved throughout with such a decent fortitude that most of the spectators seemed sensibly affected at his misfortunes, and treated him with great tenderness at the place of execution. His body is to be hung in chains at the Gosport side, near Blockhouse fort.

Tyrie, a short time before execution, made a full discovery of his accomplices, one of them is in custody, and remains to be tried; but the prisoner has discovered, that his employment was a regular and well digested system of information, in the conveying of which no pains or expence was spared. It appears, that a certain American, who lately took atrip over to Paris, has been the principal planner and conductor of the scheme, and got his neck out of the halter, by suffering La Motte, Tyrie, and others, to be apprehended and executed, when he himself was the greater culprit. By some means or other these incendiaries not only got at the Admiralty orders, but they informed the French Court of the actual force and destination of our fleets long before they were equipped, and by such means rendered their expeditions abortive.

*Extract of a letter from Portsmouth, Aug. 24.*

"A crowd of people of all ranks assembled at four o'clock in the morning at the gates of the gaol, to see Tyrie set off to the place execution, was very great. About five o'clock he was put into coach with six horses, attended by the Ordinary, Under Sheriff, Jailor, &c. and conveyed to Portsmouth, where being delivered up to the Mayor and Police of the town, he was drawn on sledge to the place of execution. After praying a little time, he was turned off, and hanged till almost dead, when he was cut down, his head severed from his body, his bowels taken out, and his heart shown to the surrounding multitude, and then thrown into a fire made for that purpose; the body was then quartered, and put into a coffin. Tyrie supported to the last the same hardened conduct as marked him on his condemnation, boldly leaping, into the coach his leaving Winchester; and on his journey to Portsmouth, by words and conduct expressing great indifference at his approaching fate.

"It astonished every spectator to see the horrid inhumanity that was suffered on the remaining part of the carcase of Thyrie. The populace had the liberty of cutting and hacking any part they thought proper, such as fingers, toes and ribs. This abominable shock to human nature must certainly have been the neglect of the sheriffs; and what was most culpable, to suffer the Jailer of Gosport to take away Tyrie's head, ana which he is now making a shew of in his own dungeon."

*Extract of a Letter from Portsmouth, Sept. 6.*

An order came down this morning for the ships to take all their stores on board directly, which is now performing in the greatest haste imaginable.

"Lord Howe has not left his command his arrival.

"The First Lord of the Admiralty is expected to see the fleet sail, and it is evensaid will go as far as Plymouth in the Victory, where he will take a view the Dock-yard, during the absence of the grand fleet.

"We have now 1160 men, including labourers, employed this yard, and talk of employing 200 more before the spring; Indeed so much work calls for additional hands.

"The person who is to go down into the Royal George, tried the experiment in the harbour this morning, in the machine contrived for the purpose; and I have just been informed that great hopes of success are expected from it, as he was able to continue under water near an hour.

"A clear benefit of 90;. was last night given at the Sadlers Wells Theatre, near this town, to the widows and orphans of the persons lost in the Royal George. Another will be given at the Theatre in the town this evening by the Comedians."

A Correspondent has made the following observations respecting the Royal George.

The absolute weight of a body sinking a fluid is equal to such part of the fluid as shall be thrust away or displaced thereby.

It is now presumed, that the Royal Georre had all her ordnance, rigging, &c. on board and therefore by calculation she displaced, or removed, a body of sea water containing 21,965,978 pounds of water, which makes 9805 tons and upwards, which is egual to her weight. Now, supposing her to be sixteen fathom perpendicular under water, and admitting the truth of 64 pounds to be a solid foot of sea water, she sustains the weight of 20,9941/2 tons.

The ship's weight, upon a present computation, 9805 tons.

The perpendicular weight of water over her, 20994 1/2 tons.

Total, without considering the water in her body. 30799 1/2 tons.

He concludes with asserting that he can form a machine upon a simple construction, whereby she may be unloaded of her ordnance and stores.

As Tyrie was conducting to execution, he said the gaoler, "At this place I was to have been rescued, could I have raised money enough, for the Smugglers had offered do it, but demanded a sum greater than was in my power to give." He afterwards said, there was one man living yet, who furnished intelligence to the French, and while he lived, the navy of Great Britain would never be successful. After he was executed and buried in the sand, the sailors dug him up, pulled him to pieces, lapped his fingers and toes in rags to make tobacco-stoppers of, and carried his entrails in triumph on a stick.

A Letter from Salisbury, dated Aug. 12, says,, "Saturday came on at the Castle of Winchester, the Trial of Mr. David Tyrie, of Gosport, for holding a treasonable Correspondence with the French Ministry. The Trial lasted near eight Hours, when he was convicted upon the clearest Evidence, and received Sentence to be executed at Portsmouth on the 24th Inst. When asked by the Clerk of Arraigns, what he had to say why Sentence of Death should not be pronounced upon him, he replyed, 'He did not suppose any Thing he could say would avail him, but he had a Hope beyond the Grave, and despised the Malice of bis Enemies.' He is about 30 Years of Age, by Birth a Scotchman, went up to London as a Servant, and lived with Mr. Vowell the Stationer, as a Clerk, above five Years, gaining the Esteem and Confidence of his Master."

Hampshire Chronicle - Monday 12 August 1782

WINCHESTER, Saturday, August 10.

At twelve o'clock on this day came one the tryal of David Tyrie, for High Treason, at the Castle of this city, before Justice Heath, under a special commission held for that purpose.

Previous to opening the cause, the prisoner begged permission of the Judge to state some reasons why his tryal should be postponed till the next Lent Assizes. These reasons were, that the short notice he had had of tryal, did not give him time to procure those witnesses on his behalf, from whose evidence he had no doubt of being acquitted. But it happened that one of them was now confined Tothillfields-Bridewell, and he had not the means to procure an Habeas Corpus to bring her down. Another witness was on a cruise, on board one of his Majesty's ships of war.– One was at this time at Brussells, and another at Ostend. He therefore prayed the indulgence of the Court to put off his tryal till the next assizes, in order to give him time to collect these witnesses, and prepare himself for tryal. After the Judge and counsel had investigated the matter, the motion was over-ruled, on its appearing that the prisoner had not hitherto made use of any endeavours to procure this evidence, though he had been six months in custody.

The cause was then opened on the part of the crown by Mr. Morris, who in a very able, humane, and comprehensive detail of the grounds of the prosecution, begged leave to call the attention of the Jury to the circumstances of an offence big with every fatal consequence to society, and destructive to the good government and well-being of a great and commercial nation.

The first witness called, was a Mrs. Harvey, who keeps a School near Scotland-yard, London.—She deposed that a Mrs. Askew, understood to be the wife of the prisoner, brought to her house on the 13th of Feb. last, a bundle of papers, requesting her to take particular care of them, and not on any account to let any person see them—struck with the singularity of the circumstance, and the tremour and anxiety of Mrs. Askew, she was induced, after her departure, to examine the papers, and finding them of a very particular nature, she carried them the same evening to a Mr. Page, a friend hers, to desire he would examine them, and let her know his opinion of their contents.

Mr. Page was then sworn— He confirmed the evidence of Mrs. Hervey *[sic]*, and said, that on finding the papers of a treasonable nature, he went the next morning and placed a constable at Mrs. Harvey's, to take the person into custody who should come to enquire for them— By thsis means Mrs. Askew, alias Mrs. Tyrie, was taken into custody; and after a few days sarch, Tyrie himself was also apprehended. By these papers it appeared that Tyrie had been at very great pains in collecting lists of all the English ships war in and out of commission; their different situations and appointments; their present and intended stations; number of Ships building, and under repair, in all the different dock-yards, and merchants yards in the kingdom, all drawn out in the hand writing of the prisoner, which was proved by two witnesses.

A Captain James was then sworn, who deposed, that in February last he met Tyrie, the prisoner, on the beach at Gosport, who, after some conversation, hired him to go to a port in France, at a premium of 15 guineas, to bring home a cargo of wines. That he met Tyrie and his wife by appointment at the Crown Inn at Gosport the same evening, where he finally engaged to undertake the voyage, and received a packet from Tyrie, which he was to deliver at Cherbourg, or Boulogne, which ever port he could soonest make. The packet, he said, was made up and sealed in his presence by Tyrie, at the Crown, and was directed and delivered by the prisoner into his own hand. That when he awoke the next morning, and considered the agreement he had made, he thought it had a very suspicious appearance, and went to an acquaintance of his, a Capt. Harrison, at Portsmouth, and related the circumstance, producing the packet, and expressing his dislike to undertake the voyage.

Capt. Harrison was then examined. He confirmed the testimony of Mr. James, and deposed, that when he received the packet out of his hand, and observed the direction to the Commandant at Cherbourg, he concluded there was treachery somewhere, and therefore broke open the letter; when being confirmed in his opinion, he set off immediately for London, and delivered the packet to Mr. Frazer, then Secretary at Lord Stormont's Office, where it remained till the prsioner was ordered for trial.

Mr. Frazer was then sworn. He proved the receipt of the packet from the hand of Capt. Harrison, and deposed that the packet thus produced in Court was identically the same delivered by Harrison; and James proved it be the same as he had received from Tyrie, and had delivered to Harrison. The contents of the packet were next examined, and found to contain five letters, one which, to the Commandant at Cherbourg, set forth and specified by name a squadron of English ships, just then sent over to hover on the French coast, to intercept a fleet of victuallers and merchantment expected to sail from Cherbourg, and to rendezvous off La Hogue. Another letter the Minister of Marine at Paris, contained the most comprehensive account of the sailing the East and West India fleets from Spithead, in February last, with the names of all the men of war appointed to convoy them. With a variety of other particulars relative to the sailing and stations of a variety of ships, then under orders on different services.—Thus, after a most fair and candid trial, which lasted near eight hours, the Jury, without hesitation, on the clearest evidence, brought in their verdict, GUILTY.

On the verdict being notified to the prisoner, he was asked if he had any reason to shew why the sentence of the law should not be inflicted, as in all cases of the kind? He replied, That it was totally unnecessary for him to say any thing, since it had been put out of his power to provide those witnesses who would have proved his innocence—but he had a hope beyond the grave, and he despised all that this world could to him!

The Judge then, after a most pathetic and moving charge, passed the following sentence upon the prisoner,— "That you be taken tothe place from whence you came, and from thence drawn upon hurdle to the place of execution; you are there to be hung by the neck, but not till you are dead; your privy-member shall be cut off, and your bowels taken out while yet alive, and burnt before your face; your head shall severed from your body, and your body divided into four quarters, and disposed as his Majesty shall think fit; and the Lord have mercy on your soul."

The Judge was pleased to order that he should be executed on Saturday the 24th of nAugust instant, PORTSMOUTH.

We hear, that the prisoner had found means to conceal a razor, with which, after his condemnation, he attempted to destroy himself, but was fortunately prevented.

The above important TRIAL will be published at LARGE, in the course of a few days, by J. WILKES, ath the Printing Office in WincheWer, and may be had of the Booksellers in Portsmouth and Gosport, and of the other Agents for this paper.

COUNTRY NEWS. Salisbury, August 12.

Saturday came on at the Castle at Winchester, the trial of Mr. David Tyrie, Gosport, for holding treasonable correspondence with the French. The trial, began about twelve o'clock at noon, and lasted till near eight o'clock at night, when upon the clearest evidence he was convicted of the offence, and received sentence to be executed at Portsmouth the 24th instant. A great number papers were produced in the handwriting of the prisoner and a woman he lived with, which had been deposited with a Gentleman, who delivered them up to Government; and a packet was intercepted which he had delivered to the Captain of a swift-sailing vessel to carry either to Bologn or Cherbourg, which ever port he could best make, to be delivered to the Commandant, to be forwarded with all dispatch to the Miniters of the Marine at Paris. The papers contained accurate accounts of all the navy of Great Britain, both in and out of commission—a copy from the weekly returns to the Navy Office from the several Dock-yards, of the progress made in the building and repairing the Royal Navy—authentic accounts of the destination of our fleets and cruisers—a proposal to furnish the French Ministry,for the sum of 700*l.*. with our signals—a plan for obtaining intelligence from all the Boards and Offices of Government, by bribing a Clerk in each Office, with the exact sum required to accomplish such corruption—and a proposal to fix Spies at Portsmouth and Plymouth, to obtain intelligence of the operations our fleets. He appears to be a mast artful, indefatigable, and enterprising man. During the trial he wrote a great number of notes to his Counsel, of questions which he wished to put to the witnesses, and was astonishingly collected in his mind throughout the whole. After conviction, when he was asked by the Clerk of Arraigns, what he had to say why sentence of death should not pronounced upon him, he replied, "He did not suppose any thing he could say would avail him, but he had a hope beyond the grave, and despised the malice of his enemies." He is a likely man, about 30 years age.

Tyrie is by birth a Scotchman, went to London as a servant, and lived with Mr. Vowell the Stationer, as a Clerk, above five years, gaining the esteem and confidence of his Master: He afterwards entered into business in the mercantile life, and had his integrity been equal to his abilities, must have done very well. A few years since he offered himself a Candidate for Hindon, in this County, and afterwards, failing in his views of a Merchant, procured himself a place in the Navy-Office at Portsmouth, which led him to his last fatal employment.

Caledonian Mercury - Saturday 17 August 1782

On Saturday came on by a special commission at the Town-hall in Winchester, the trial of David Tyrie, before Hon. Mr Justice Heath, for high treason, in sending intelligence to the French. BY ten o’clock in the morning the court was uncommonly crouded, but the judge not make his appearance ’till after twelve. A motion was made to put off the trial, which was grounded on an affidavit of the prisoner, that four of his witnesses were not ready; one is a woman now in Tothil-fields bridewell, two sailors who are abroad, and a man residing at Ostend. The court, however, thinking he had a sufficient time to be prepared, granted nothing for the motion. Mr. Morris, for the crown, opened the case,and enlarged on the dangerous effects produced by the permission of such persons escaping punishment. Maria Harvey proved that a bundle of papers, had been her delivered to her by Mrs. Askew, about the 13th of February; that the particular charge given with them raised her curiosity to enquire into the contents of the bundle. She had been induced in consequence to open them, and being of opinion that the contents were of a dangerous nature, she carried them to a Mr. Page, in Westminster, who being of the opinion, carried them to the Secretary of State's Office. The papers were produced and proved——they consisted of copies of papers called Navy Progresses, being a list of all the ships of the navy, the situation and state of repair of each, &c. &c. To these were added remarks of their destination, a description of thedock-yards at Portsmouth, Plymouth, and all the public, and even several of the private docks. They also contained a plan, by which it was proposed to furnish a person in France  with intelligence on very moderate terms, when the importance of the object was considered;——the particulars were an express to be employed, which would travel 450 miles, to be paid at 13d per mile; a monthly salary of five or six guineas to a person at each of the dock yards, and also a salary of two or three guineas to a man in the lesser yars. Several other papers were produced, all going to the purpose of giving information to the enemy. Mr. Vowel, a stationer in London, knew the prisoner, he had been a clerk to him five years; he proved most of the papers produced to be the hand-writing of the prisoner. Captain William James proved, that Tyrie had bargained with him to go to Boulogne, to purchase wines. He had ageed to pay him fifteen guineas for the voyage, and also to give him a letter of credit for 50*l.* more to trade with. He also delivered to him a packet for the commandant of the port, and a passport for Boulogne or  Cherburg. The witness felt that carrying letters to France in time of war was improper; he had, in consequence thereof, communicared his thoughs to an acquaintance, one Captain Harrison. The Captain opened the packet; it contained five letters, which gave an account of the departute of the East India fleet, the same of the West India fleet, the strength and names of their respective convoys, &c. One of those letters was signed with the prisoner's own name, and another with the name of Croix. These paers were all proved to be in the hand-writing of the prisoner. On behalf of the prisoner one witness was produced, who said nothing as to the matter in question. Mr. Watson, counsel for the prisoner, made a very ingenious speech in his behalf, which was ably replied to by Mr. Morris. The judge then summed up the evidence in a most able charge to the jury, who after a few minutes deliberation, brought in their verdict guilty.——— Mr. Justice Heath, with that humanity which so peculiarly masks his character in all situations, amde a most excellent speech to the prisoner, advising him to prepare for that fate injured laws of his country exacted him to suffer. He adjured him therefore to prepare for appearing before that tribunal where alone he might expect mercy; for such acts as these made it impossible for him to hope for any of his sovereign; who, however merciful he might be, could not, in tenderness to his subjects, permist such offenders to escape. He then proceeded to pass the following sentence: "The sentence that the law awards against you, and that this court adjudges is, that you, David Tyrie, be taken back to that place whence you came; that you be taken from thence on a hurdle to the place of execution, there to be hung by the neck but not till you are dead, but that you be cut down while yet alive, your bowels be taken out, and burnt before your face: that your head be severed from your body, and your body be divided into four quarters, your head and body to be disposed of as the King shall think fit, and the Lord have mercy upon your soul." The prisoner heard this sentence without any apparent emotion, and during the whole trial was employed in writing notes to his counsel. The prisoner is by birth a Scotchman, he went to London as a servant, he lived with Mr. Vowel as a clerk about five years, and gained the esteem and confidence of his master. He afterwards went into business in the mercantile line, with Messrs. Parker and Crowe, with whom some time since he became a bankrupt. It is, however, supposed, that if his integrity had been equal to his abilities, he might have had very good success in his business. He some few years ago offered himself a candidate for the borough of Hindon, and having failed in his views as a merchant, procured himfself a place in the navy-office at Portsmouth, which led him to this fatal enterprize. The trial did not conclude until eight o’clock on Saturday evening.

David Tyrie, who was convicted of high-treason on Saturday last at Winchester for holding a correspondence with the French, was the projector of that late gold coinage, for which it was said, he was offered a place of about 200*l.* a year, which he refused, considering it inadequate to his services.—— After he was taken from to the bar the gaoler found a razor concealed under the knee-band of his breeches.— After conviction when he was asked by the Clerk of Arraings why sentence of death should not be pronounced upon him, he replied "he did not suppose any thing he could say would avail him, but he had a hope beyond the grave, and he despised the malice of his enemies".

WINCHESTER, *Saturday*, August 24.

In consequence of the attempt lately made by the felons in our county gaal to break out of prison, and to release Tyrie, as mentioned particularly in our last week's paper, a meeting was held the White-Hart-Inn in this city on Monday last, by several of the county Justices, in order to the aiders and abettors of the above business. John Fulker, who was condemned at our last assizes, and since reprieved, related that about six weeks ago Tyrie applied to him and Fox, another malefactor, to desire they would assist him in procuring tools to break out of prison, and that for their secresy and diligence in the business he would take them to France, and settle one hundred pounds per annum on them. Tyrie had previously engaged with Captain Maynard, a prisoner for debt, who some ago kept the Vine Inn, at Cowes, to keep a constant look out at night, and to inform in case any watch was kept upon them, or any circumstance happening to impede their design for which service David Tyrie had promised pay Maynard's debts, and extricate him from all his troubles. Deadman, who was confined at the last assizes for horse stealing, but reprieved, was also let into the secret, and was prevaled upon to send for his brother to purchase tools for them, for which he was to be greatly rewarded. On his arrival, he received half a guinea from Tyrie, and was desired to go to some neighbouring town to buy  the tools, for fear of a discovery; but he went and purchased them in the town and put them up the sink-hole of the prison, from whence they were taken by Fulker and carried into the Dungeon.—Maynard furnished them with candle, and prevailed upon the Baker, J. Godwin, to procure two center bitts, for the of boring thro' the plank, which Maynard gave to Tyrie, with a wig, and a pair of trowsers to go off in.. It was also intended to procure a quantity of oil and spitits, in order to set fire to the prison at the time they were to leave it, which horrid business, if put in execution, must have been fatal to about twenty debtors, who were connaed in a room over the Dungeon, and who must have been burnt alive, had not the plot thus been fortunately discovered.

Deadman's brother was committed to take his trial at the next assizes; a detainer was also lodged against Maynard for the same purpose, and Godwin was bound over to appear at the same time — aiding and abetting convicts to make their escape, is punishable by law with transportation for seven years.

After Tyrie was tried, and under sentence of death, no communication ciuld be had with him by the other conspirators, as he was locked in the condemned cell, and no one suffered be with him. Maynard, however, in order to have further consultations with him, pretended it was in his power to get some very important discoveries from Tyrie, provided Mr. White, keeper of the prison, would suffer him to be alone with him: and on Mr. White's refusing to give him leave, Maynard wrote to the Secretary of State's Office, to the same effect, and absolutely procured an order to have as much private conversation with Tyrie as he pleased.— The above discovery being made in the mean while, when the order came down it was not complied with, as the intentioh was obviously to forward their escape, instead of making discoveries of such importance to the nation.

This morning at four o'clock, David Tyrie was conveyed from hence in coach and six, under a strong guard, to Portsmouth, where he was executed pursuant to his sentence. His behaviour to the last, even when surrounded by the horrible apparatus of death, used in cases such as this, was undaunted and bold to an extreme.

PORTSMOTH. Aug. 31.

On Thursday morning, between nine and ten o'clock, the Royal George man of war of 100 guns, on board of which Admiral Kempenfelt had hoisted his flag, nearly in the center of Lord Howe's fleet at Spithead, most unfortunately and instantaneously went to the bottom. The melancholy accident was occasioned by the being heeled upon her side, in order to have the water-pipe of her cistern repaired, at which instant of time a strong squall of wind at N. N. W. threw her further upon her side, and the lower port holes being unluckily open, she filled and went down in less than three minutes. The alarm and confusion at an event so unexpected and so horrid, is indescribable. A victualling sloop, and several wherries full of people, which had just put off in order to go ashore, were drawn down by the prodigious whirlpool and suction occasioned by the sinking of the ship. Of about fourteen hundred men, women, and boys which were on board, not more than 320 were saved; and it must give unspeakable concern to every lover of his country, as well as to the humane heart, that the brave and able veteran Admiral Kempenfelt is amongst the drowned.— Major Graham, and several other officers of marines, the surgeon, the master, three lieutenants, several midshipmen, and some ladies who had gone on board to see the ship, were also lost. Captain Waghorn, Admiral Kempenfelt's Captain, was fortunately gone on duty for few hours on board another ship. The ship's complement was 900 men, and she was completely manned with the best seamen, victualled and ready for sea at an hour's notice. There were also a number of carpenters from the yard, at work in her; and several of the officers, with the whole of the marines, had only come on board from Portsmouth the preceding evening. The unspeakable distress of this fatal catastrophe has occasioned is inconceivable. The shore for a length of time exhibited scenes of the most poignant grief, being lined with persons lamenting their fathers, or their children, who had perished in this calamity. And every one will read with added concern that the brave Admiral Kempenfelt, who had hold of the same rope with a marine, was so exhausted and fatigued, that he let go but a few minutes before a boat reached the unhappy spot where he sunk, and picked up the marine alive.

Though the depth in which she now lies, about fourteen fathom, is not considerable, it seems to be the general opinion here, that she cannot be raised, as no purchase can be obtained equal to the immense weight. But if this ship, so long the pride of our navy, and so essential a part of the strength of this country, at this most critical period, could be recovered, the loss of so many brave and able seamen is irremediable, and never sufficiently to be lamented.

An accident of this kind to a capital ship, is unpredented *[sic]* in the annals of the Navy.

The Royal George man of war is the oldest first rate in the service; she was built at Woolwich, her keel was laid down in 1751, and she was hauled out of the dock in July 1755, it being unusual to build such large ships on slips to launch; she was pierced for 100 guns, but having lately had two additional ports, including the carronades, mounted 108 guns; she was rather short and high, as all the old first rates are, but so good a sailer, that she has had more flags on board her than any vessel in the service. Lord Anson, Admiral Boscawen, Lord Hawke, Lord Rodney, Lord Howe, and several other principal officers, have repeatedly commanded in her. Lord Hawke commanded the squadron in her which fought the French under Conflans, when the Suberb of 70 guns, was sunk by her cannon and the Soliel Royal of 84, burnt on shore: she carried the tallest masts and canvas of any English built ship in the navy, and originally the heaviest metal, viz. 52, 40, and 28 pounders, but they were lately changed, account of her age, to 40, 32, and 18 pounders.

WINCHESTER, Saturday, August 31.

David Tyrie, who was executed at Portsmouth on Saturday last, for carrying on a treasonable correspondence with the French, could not be prevailed upon to make any discovery of his colleagues in the above iniquitous business. A few days before his execution, he sent up an offer to the Secretary of State's Office, to discover a person in an elevated line of life, who is caressed by the first people in the country, whose connexions and situation enable him to give our enemies the best information, and who has for some time followed this business together with several others in an inferior situation, provided Government wouid enter into an engagement that they should not prosecuted for any overt act up to the present time—but this offer is seems was rejected. It was hinted to him, whether, on condition of saving his own life, he would give up the above people to a due course of law; but he declined it, saying, he despised life upon any terms where that of another person was involved, and that, whether he lived died, no blood should lay at his door.—He conducted himself from the prison here to the place of execution, and during the whole of the preparation for his miserable dissolution, with the most singular composure and magnanimity,

From the time he was put upon the sledge, till he came to the gibbet, he continued an unconcerned conversation with the goaler, in which he expressed that he thought there were not three better, sounder, or honester hearts this kingdom, than his own, which was just going to be burnt. That there was only thing which gave him concern, which was, that his father was living, and that he feared this misfortune would bring his grey hairs with sorrow to the grave. He declined saying a word to the populace, observing, that he knew not why he was to feed or gratify the idle curiosity of the multitude. He never hung his head the whole time.—When arrived at the place of execution, no halter was provided, upon which he smiled, and expressed astonishment at the inattention and neglect of his executioners; and indeed the business would have been retarded for some time, had not a rope and pulley been procured out of a lugger that lay under shore, during which time he read several passages in a bible he carried in his hand.—Before he was drawn up, he delivered a paper, setting forth, that he had authorised no person to publish any account of his life, nor was there any one who knew sufficiently of him to give any genuine particular of his transactions to the world.

After hanging exactly twenty-two minutes, he was lowered upon the sledge, and the sentence literally put in execution. His head was severed from his body, his heart taken out and burnt, his privities cut off, and his body quartered. He was then put into a coffin, and buried among the pebbles by the sea-side; hut no sooner had the officers retired, but the sailors dug up the coffin, took out the body, and cut it in a thousand pieces, every one carrying away a piece of his body to shew their messmates on board.—A more dreadful, affecting execution was perhaps never seen. It was computed by many intelligent persons on the spot, that there were not less than a hundred thousand spectators present on the occasion.

DECLARATION of DAVID TYRIE, concerning the HISTORY of his LIFE.

"If after my death, any person should attempt to impose a HISTORY of my LIFE upon the public, leave this to serve as a declaration, that I have left neither instructions nor materials for any person to write a history from, and that *no man living* had my confidence so far as to be able to give any thing like a genuine account of my actions to tbe world. I was sincerely disposed to have done it myself, for the benefit of mankind, and my poor orphan babes; but the time allowed after my conviction was not sufficient.— I leave this therefore as *a caution to tbe public*, in the hands of Mr. John Vowell, jun. whom I request to make it publicly known, *should any publications respecting me be attempted*."

Winchester Gaol, Aug. 23, Signed DAVID TYRIE.

Witnesses: Robert Serle, Under Sheriff of Hants.  
J. White, jun. Deputy Keeper Winchester Gaol.

*To Mr. John Vowell, jun.*

From hence it becpmes obvious, that the Book now advertised under the title of *"A true and concise account of the Life and Trial of David Tyrie"*, to be had of Messrs. Sadler and Burdon in Winchester, Collins and Johnson in Salisbury, Dawkins in Gosport, Breadhower in Portsmouth, Skelton and Mills and Baker in Southampton, us no other than a *spurious publication*, compiled from mere imagination, to anmswer mercenary purposes.

During the whole course of the war, only one other person was detected in any act of treacon; and he appears to have been actuated merely by mercenary motives, though La Motte and John the Painter probably acted from principle. This was one David Tyrie, a native of Edinburgh. Having been bred in the mercantile line, and engaged in a number of speculations with a view to gain money, in all of which he discovered considerable abilities, he at last engaged in the dangerous one of conveying intelligence to the French of the ships of war fitted out in Britain, the time of their sailing, &c. For this he was apprehended in February 1782. The discovery was made by means of one Mrs. Aslkew, who passed for his wife, having delivered a bundle of papers in a hurry to a school mistress, and desiring her not to show them to any body. Instead of this, however, she not only inspected them herself, but showed them to another, by whom they were sent to the Secretary at war. By this, and another packet discovered by William James, who had been employed to carry it to France, Tyrie was convicted and executed in the month of August 1782. He behaved with great resolution, and at last showed rather an indecent levity and unconcern, by laughing at the place of execution. The sentence not only took place in the dreadful manner appointed by law, but the crowd behaved with the most shameful and unexampled barbarity. "Such (says the accounts of his execution) being the *singular conduct* of many who were near the body, that happy was he who could procure a finger, or some vestige of the criminal!" — This unhappy man, while in prison, had, with his companions, contrived a method of effecting their escape, by working through a brick-wall three feet thick, and covering the hole with a plank coloured like the bricks; but the scheme was discovered by the imprudence of Tyrie himself asking the keeper how thick the wall was.

On the tenth of August one David Tyrie was indicted at the assizes held at Winchester for traiterously corresponding with his majesty's enemies. After taking the depositions of the several evidences, and reading a variety of papers in court, tending to criminate the culprit; when the clerk of arraigns put the usual question, he made this very extraordinary reply, "It is in vain for me to say any thing. Poverty has been the cause of my conviction, because I had not the means to bring my witnesses here. However, I have a hope beyond the grave, and despise every thing that has been done to me." The judge then pronounced sentence of death, and he was accordingly executed, as usual in cases of high treason.

EVIDENCE FOR THE CROWN

*Maria Hervey* sworn.

Examined by Mr. Serjeant Grose. `[Afterwards one of the justices B. R.]`

Where do you live?— In Carvick's-row, Scotland yard.

I believe you keep a school?— I do.

Do you remember any lady, at any time, coming to you with some papers?— Yes; on Wednesday, the 13th of FeDruary.

Who was she?— A woman who called herself Askew.

What did you do with those papers?— I inspected into them, and then delivered them up to a gentleman of Westminster, Mr. Page.

How came you to inspect into them?— From various reasons. The lady gave me reason, from what she said, to suspect their being of a criminal nature.

What were those reasons?— By her saying, 'she had taken three coaches to bring them;' and she appeared very much flurried. She said, 'the gentleman that delivered them to her was in trouble, and wished to get them off.' This created a suspicion in me. I therefore inspected into them; and gave them all, on the same day, to Mr. Page.

Cross-examined by *Mr. Watson*.

Had you any acquaintance with Mrs. Askew?— Very little: I had seen her four or five different times before.

Of what nature was your acquaintance with her?— Her sister sent a couple of young ladies to school to me, for education. I had seen Mrs. Askew at Mrs. Smith's lodgings.

Do you know where Mrs. Askew lived?— No; not when first I became to have some knowledge of her.

Did she give any other reason but this for intrusting the papers to you?— No. She before had told me she had something to intrust with me, and wanted a favourable opportunity.

How long was that before?— About a month or six weeks. And she asked me which was the most eligible time of seeing me alone. I told her my hours of leisure.

And she came at that distance of time afterwards?— Yes.

Do you recollect pretty perfectly what she sud?— "Mrs. Hervey, I have something to communicate to you, and wish to find an opportunity of telling you." When she came with the papers, she said, she would take it as a favour if I would take particular care of these papers; and she hoped I would not shew them to any person. I said, No, certainly I shall not shew them; I would not shew my own papers, that were of a family nature; and certainly should not shew them.

Had she explained to you that these were papers of a family nature?— No; but I thought they were so.

Had not she told you they were some concerns her husband did not know of?— No; she told me no such thing.

Recollect accurately that part of the conversation?— She said no such thing. The man, she said, had given them to her; 'he,' she sud. I said, What, Mr. Tyrie? She said, Yes. She said, if Mr. Tyrie was here, he would be very angry with you for calling me Askew, for he took me to church for a name.

Did she not tell you she was afraid he should know of these papers?— No; she said no such thing.

You said she expressed considerable anxiety?— Yes; and was very much flurried.

And said, if Mr. Tyrie knew of your calling her Mrs. Askew, he would be very angry?— Yes; but I said she had never passed by any other name in my hearing.

She said she was in trouble, and wished to get rid of the papers?— No; she said he was in trouble.

Recollect whether you did not understand from her, at that time, that Mr. Tyrie did not know any thing about these papers?— I had every reason in the world to think he did.

What are those reasons?— Her saying 'he' immediately upon my mentioning Mr. Tyrie's name: and from having seen Mr. Tyrie; and from knowing that she lived with Mr. Tyrie.

*Court.* What did you say about what passed upon your mentioning Mr. Tyrie's name?— *A.* She said, Yes. She said they came from he. I wished to know whether it was he. I had seen them together at her sister's house. I said, What, Mr. Tyrie? She said, Yes.

Mr. *Watson*, Upon her saying 'he' would be angry, you asked who 'he' was; what, Mr. Tyrie? *A*.* Yes.

But she did not say the papers came fromm him?— No; she did not.

Mr. Serjeant *Grose*, When she said 'he,' and you said, What, Mr. Tyrie? how came the name of Mr. Tyrie to occur to you? *A.* Because I had frequently heard her sister mention the name ot Tyrie, and her sister's children had mentioned it in my school. I had heard her sister mention the name frequentiy.

You said just now she said Mr. Tyrie would be angry?— She never mentioned such a word as his anger when I asked if Mr. Tyrie gave her the papers; then she made no answer.

What did she say about his anger, on account of your calling her Askew?— She said, "If you was to call me Askew in his presence, he would be angry," When she gave the papers, she said he had delivered them to her to get them off. These were the very words. I thought it astonishing she should take three coaches, to bring papers. I asked her what that meant: for she said she took three different coaches, in this manner: that she stopoed about ten minutes, and then took another; for that he was in a great deal of trouble, that he wished to get them off safe, and that she had taken that method.

What did you say next after that?— I do not recollect that I made any reply to it. I had my own sentiments upon it. I thought there was something very bad. When I said, what, Mr. Tyrie? she was then silent. It was exceeding cold. She had a large Brunswick great coat on. I said, Madam, you have a good covering a^nst the inclemency of the weather; for it is very severe. She said, she had great occasion for it; for she travelled night and day. I said, Travel night and day! you told me you lived at Ranelagh: that is not a mat way. She replied, O dear! I have come five hundred miles.

You said before, that she said he was in a great deal of trouble, and wished to get them off safe?

*Court.* What that woman said is not evidence.

Mr. Serj. *Grose*. Did I understand you right, that you had seen this lady and Mr. Tyrie together?— *A.* Yes; I had seen them twice together.

Is the prisoner that person?— He is.

Mr. *Watson*. You seem to have mended your evidence in this last account of it; for the account you gave to me was, you called her Mrs. Askew: upon which she said, if he heard you call me Mrs. Askew, he would be angry. That was a part of your evidence, and the point to which you applied in answering my questions to the word 'he.' Now, in your answer to this gentleman, you said the word 'he' related to the prisoner, when she gave you the papers; that 'he' was in trouble, and sent them. You said otherwise to me. Which is the truth?— *A.* She did not say she brought them from Mr. Tyrie. She said 'he.'

*Court.* Had you been talking of Mr. Tyrie before?— *A.* No.

Mr. *Jonathan Page* sworn.  
Examined by Mr. *Batt*.

Are you acquainted with the last witness?— I am.

Do you remember her, at any time, shewing you a bundle of papers?— Yes.

On what day was it?— In the evening of the 13th of February last. She brought the papers to me late in the evetiing. She did not tell me the nature of them at the time, but she desired I would look at them. I said, as soon as I was at leisure, I would examine them. It was rather late before I was disengaged. Then I looked them over, and saw the nature of them. I returned them to her, and told her I would consider, against next morning, what was proper to be done. I got up early next morning; and went, with a constable, to her house. I took the papers from her, and left the constable there, with a charge to seize any person who should come to enquire for the papers. I examined the papers fully, marked them, and then sent them to a gentleman at that time in the ministry, the secretary at war. He returned them in a short time by his servant, with a note: in consequence of which I went to the Admiralty with these papers; and saw Mr. Stephens. After that, we went to the office of the secretary of state; and there were two or three meetings upon these papers, and the examining of them. The papers were delivered at tne secretary of state's office, to Mr. Fraser, or Mr. Chamberlayne.

Look at these papers, and see whether the marks upon them are, or are not, of your making?— They are.

And they were marked by you at the second time they were put into your hands?— They were. They are from No. 1, to No. 50 I believe.

Mr. *John Vowell* sworn.  
Examined by Mr. Serjeant *Grose*,

Have you ever seen the prisoner write?— I have.

Do you know his hand writing?— I do.

Pick out such of those papers as you know to be his hand-writing. Please first to inspect No. 1 to No. 8, which are intitled "Progress of the Navy." — These papers, No. 1 to 8 appear to be his hand-writing.

Mr. *John Palmer* sworn.  
Examined by Mr. Serjeant *Grose*.

Did you ever see Mr. Tyrie write?— I have.

Do you know his hand-writing?— I do.

Look at these papers, from No. 1 lo 8?— I believe these to be his hand-writing.

*Thomas Flint* sworn.  
Examined by Mr. *Batt*.

I believe you have an emplpyment in the Navy-office?— Yes, I have.

In what particular branch?— In the surveyor's office.

Look at these papers (No. 1 to 8), are they similar to papers you have in your office so intitled?— I have here a book which contains the progress of the navy for the whole year.

Where is that book kept?— It is kept in the office.

Does this account appear to be a copy of that book?— It appears to be an exact copy.

What is the date of the list you are looking at?— The 23d of November, 1781.

Now cast your eye over them, and inform the court and jury, whether you find it correspond, or find any difierence: if you find any difference, say what that difference is.— I have compared it with what is done in his majesty's yard at Deptford; it exactly corresponds: and in the merchants' yard, where ships are building. At Woolwich, there are two armed store-ships in my book, which are not in this; but these are things of no manner of consequence.

Mr. *Morris*. I see there are three ships at Deptford less, in this account, than in your's; they are trilling things: one is the Hound sloop, only 14 guns, a cutter, and a yacht.

In that list which has been proved to be of the prisoner's hand-writing, there are the names of the captans, together with some characters. Are those, or not, contained in your book?— They are not; the names of captains are never contained in this.

How often are these lists made out, and sent to the Navy-office?— Every week.

And then you make them out in such a book as you have now before you, from the respective lists sent from the different yards?— Yes.

Is that a report of one week from the different yards, or of how long time?— This I have spoken to is of one week only.

Look at the paper No. 2. — That is without date.

Is it such a paper as the other you have spoken to?— No. There are more ships in this account than we have in the original book of the 23d of November, 1781, if it means that day.

Cross-examined by Mr. *Watson*.

You say that list of ships resembles the list you have, only with small variations?— It does.

But is it a copy of your account?— Does it contain the observations, for instance, which yours contains?— Nearly; and I dare say was to answer the same purpose. It is the progress of the navy; and this is a list of the same ships that I mentioned: there are one or two small ships indeed different. I did not look farther than Deptford, the merchant's yards, and Woolwich.

Mr. *Watson*. I meant, whether it contained your official observations.

Mr, *Batt*. What is the title of the book?— A. "An account of the readiness for the sea of his majesty's ships and vessels under repair, and of those building and rebuilding, and of such as lie in harbour." The book contains more than the title imports; for here are all the ships that are building for his majesty in the merchants' yards, which is not mentioned in the title.

Does the title of that paper you have looked at correspond with the title of your book?— The words are the very same.

(Several of the entries were read.)

No. XI.— (Proved to be the prisoner's handwriting). It contained a rough draught of a list of ships, with their condition, at the merchants' yards, at Portsmouth, Plymouth, Woolwich, Sheerness, and Harwich.

No. XIV. and XV.— (The prisoner's handwriting). They contained a list of the navy of Great Britain, in numerical order, to No. 221 ships, from the Britannia of 100 guns, down to the Seaford, with the number of guns they carry.

No. X VIII.--A list of ships, not in the prisoner's hand-writing; but a remark against one of them in the prisoner's hand-writing, in which he says, "Going to Mahon or Africa, to be met by the convoy with troops."

No. XIX.— (The prisoner's hand-writing).— It contained a list of the particulars of a great number of ships. At the bottom, "4th Jan. to Mr. Bonnier. 8th Jan. to Mr. Brodelet."

At the bottom of the paper, in another hand, were written these directions:

"For Ostend. A Monsieur De Neve, à l'Hôtel de Ville, pour Mr. Domiqique le Moine, à Ostend."

^ Harwich being a more inconsiderable dock, two or three guineas per month would be sufficient.

" Woolwich and Deptford, being at a short distance from town, may be fumianed hy the agent there. '

"By the above, I mean regularly to have a packet from each twice a week. Except in matters of great importance, where it might be necessary to send an express; and it is expected, that the agent will be reimbursed his actual expence on such occasions, over and above the stated allowance.

" If it is required to know weekly the

Quantities of stores and provisions contracted or by the Victualling-offece for the use of the fleet, a person in that office is necessary, but not otherways; and such information may be had for about three or four guineas per month.

"A communication with a person in the Navy-office is very necessary; and every information wanted from that quarter may be had for seven guineas ana a half per month.

"A conununication with the Admiralty is also necessaiy; but, as that is for information only, no sum can be stipulated, but must depend on the importance of the occasion, and condition of the officer.

William Jnma sworn.

Examined by Mr. Bait,

[8S8

Where do you live?— ^I formerly was resident at Lyme.

Where did you live in February last?— « At Portsmouth and Gosport I have a brother there.

Look at the prisoner: are you aoquainted with him?— I know the prisoner.

Did you see him any time last February?— Yes, at Gosport. I am rather thick of hearing;: I will rehearse the whole story if you ^wase; afterwards, if you ask me any questions, I will endeavour to answer thent to the best of my knowledge. I was acquainted with one captain Bowles; he told me he was employed by Mr. Tyrie to go to Ostend.

I must bring you to the time I mentioned in February. ??In the other circumstances of your story, and inform the Court what passed between the prisoner and you in February.^I met Mr. Tyrie pretty near th< beach at Gosport: he asked me. If I had beard any thing of the misfortune that ha4 happened to Bowles, who was employed ia captain Harrison's vessel to go to Ostend. He said, Captain Bowles had we misfortune to lose the vessel coming out of Boulogne. Mr. Tyrie said« He wanted to Supply some ships goine out to 1])e East Indies with wine. He said. He wanted to get the wine home, and asked me if I woum go and conduct a vessel home from Boulogne. I said, ndy business required me to go to Guernsey. He said, He should eive me 15/. or 15 guineas, if I would go and bring home the wine to Spithead, and the people tj^twere there; and that I should have a letter of credit for 50/. if I chose to purchase any thing. I asked him what vessel he had to carry me there } He said. He would have a vessel at a moment's notice; he could have one of Stevens's at the Point. I went with him there. Stovens was indifferent about going. I told Mr. Tyrie the wiid was too short to go to Boulogne. He then said, If I could not get there. Cherbourg would answer his purpose as well as Boulogne. I told Him I had been there many times, but could never buy any wine; but he said, the eentleman he should send me to would siippJ^ me with what he wanled. I told him, it being war-time, it would be hazardous to go into an enemy's country; I thought they mieht detain me there. He said, N(^ he would give me a piece of paper of signals, which I was to make at my arrival there, that nobody should detain me. I asked him if I should have my liberty to £o ox^ shore?— He said, I might; but none of t&) people on board must go on shore: that I should be provided with necessaries.

Did he eiveyou any signals.^ — He did; but, before I had the signals, I wnitckl upon him at the Crown-inn; there he delivered me a packet. ^

At what time was this?— Between nine and ten o'clock at night of the same day; I think it was the 17th of February; it was of a Sunday.

Are you sure it wus on a Sunday?— ^Yes; and I believe it was on the 17th; Mr. Tyrie delivered me a packet. ^

When you went to Tyrie's lodginss at the Crown, who was with him I — ^Mr. Mailstone. and Mr. Tyrie's wife, or a woman that passed for his wife, was with him.

Did you observe what they were doing?— Mr. Tyrie and his wife were b^oth silting at the •table, and I believe the^r were both writing; but I did not interfere with their business, as I looked upon it to be letters of trade. Mr. Tyrie, after that, gave me a packet of letters.

Look at that packet.— This is the same, I believe; I am sure the outside is. It was between nine and ten o'clock when he delivered me this. Mr. Tyrie and his wife -then set off, as they said, for London.

You mentioned before, that Mr. T^rie gave you a paper of signals to protect you agamst , the French when you came upon their coast: what did you do with that?— I carried the papers with me to London, and delivered them to Mr. Chamberlayne.

Look at these papers. — These are the papers that were deliverea to me by Mr. T)Tie; and that I gave to Mr. Chamberlayne.

Cross-examined by Mr. Watson,

You say this is a paper which you gave to Mr. Chamberlayne?— Yes.

What marks are there by which you know it?— There are the two first letters 6f my name upon it

When did you give that paper to Mr. Chamberlayne?— It was of a Monday; I think, the 2$d day of the month; but I will

not be positive to the day of the month: but

I am positive this is the paper.

It was on a Monday; in what month was it?— In the month of February.

At what place?— The office in Bow-street.

What carried you with that paper to the ofi)ce in Bow-street?^-A coach.

By whom were you sent there?— By Mr. William Harrison, of Gosport.

Who is Mr. Wm. Harrison?— The master of a vessel he has been formerly, as I am informed; and He resides at Gosport.

(The signals read.)

« Signals. — ^A St. George's jack at the mast-head, a French ensien at the staff, a weoff at the gaff end^ and fire two guns or muskets to leeward."

Mr. Morri$, That is an exact copy of this paper that was delivered to Mrs. Hervey, which was with the papers that were in the hand-writine of the prisoner.

Look at that other paper. What use did Mr. Tyrie say you was to make of that, when he i^ve it you?— I did not understand the English of it; but Mr. Tjme said^ after I had

made those signals, a boat would cbme off to me, and I was to deUver this, paper, and then the packet, and was then to be permitted to go on shore.

Did he say any thing about that paper protecting you?— ^He said, when I produced that paper, I should not be hurt.

Afler this conversation, you said. Mr. Tyrie, and the woman who called herself his wife, went to London?— ^Yes.

Did you keep this packet in your possession?7- Yes. The next morning, when I came to think of it, I thought it not right to carry a packet of letters to an enemjrs port, without knowing the contents of it. I took this packet to Mr. Harrison, and left it in his nands, to take down the directions: he brought it me again; and I had not kept it ten minutes before captain Harrison came in. and took them up off the table; and I did not see them any more.

Mr. Watton. You say you had a packet which was directed in the way that packet was which you had in your hand just now, and that this is the cover it. Did you open it?— No.

Did captain Harrison open it in your presence?— ^I was walking up and down the room when ho opened it.

Was any other person present } — "So,

Do you know how many papers there were in that packet?— I cannot swear; I think there were five: but I did not take any particular notice of it.

Had you any conversation at that time about Tyrie with captain Harrison?— ^I do not know any thing particular.

Did captain Harrison talk of makins a hundred pK)und of the papers?— He did, while* we were in captain Standneld's house.

Did he say now he was to make a hundred pound of them?— No.

Did captain Harrison tell you, you must make Tyrie look as black as possible, in order to get this hundred pound?— He did. When I arrived at London, he said, We are goi^g to the office; I would have you make it as black as you can against Tyrie. I said, No blacker than the truth.

Have you had any conversation since with a woman that is in lothill-ficlds Bridewell?— Very little.

Do you know a man of the name of Ramsey?— ^Yes.

Have not you had some conversation with him about Harrison, and this transaction?— I may have had some conversation with him.

Did not you tell him you knew nothing about it but what Harrison bid you say.' — No; I am sure I could never say any such thing.

Have you had any conversation with Ramsey, in which you said that you swore to thmgs in Bow-street that you knew nothine about?— Never, to my knowledge. I coula not say a thing of that kind.

William Harriwn sworn. Examined by Mr. Batt.

Are you acquainted with William James?— I have been acquainted with him only since this aftair happened: I never saw him before.

Do you remember his shewing you a packet of letters?— He did not shew it me, till I entreated him to do it.

Look at this packet: Is it the same that James shewed you?— That is th^ outside case.

What did you do with thaty when you had it in your possession?— I got it to my own house. Mr. James told me capt. Standfield was a friend and acquaintance of his, and desire me to let him take it to him, to ask his advice. I was dubious to let him have it, for fear he should take it away. I opened it. Upon seeing there was a letter directed to the mmister of marine, at Paris, I thought it could not be a wine-merchant's business. I then put them into my pocket, hasted to London immediately, and delivered them to lord Stormont's secretary, Mr. Fraser.

Are the contents in this cover the same as when you delivered themP — ^I believe they are: I delivered the whole.

Cross-examined by Mr. Watum.

At what time did you carty them to London?— On the I9th of February I went I arrived in Loudon on the 20th.

William Frtuer, esq. sworn. Examined by Mr. Serjeant Groie.

You were, Sir, at that time, under secretary at lord Stormont*s office?— ^I was.

Where had you that packet from?— From Mr. Harrison, in the secretary of state's office.

Are those the papers, as you received them?— They are: they are every one of them marked by me in my own hand-writing.

How soon didyou mark them mfler vou received tbem?— To the best of my recollection, I marked most of them, I believe I might say all, in Mr. Harrison's presence.

Did you receive any more?— ^I did not

Did you mark them as you found them in the cover?— ^I did.

(The outside cover to the packet was in the prisoner's hand-writing.)

Direction: ** For captain James; to be opened upon his departure from Dunnose."

Mr. Morris to Harriton. Did you open the outside cover?— A, I did partly, but nothing else. •

What was inside that cover?— ^Lettefs.

Did you deliver the whole to that gentleman?— ^Yes; every piece of paper.

And none but what were m that cover?— Not one. There was a little piece of paper besides; that vras signals.

I was to let him know what ships sailed with convoys, and what arrived. When I seemed surprised at that, he hinted to me, that he did not send off any advices without shewing them to i^e ministry.

How came he to hint that to you?— ^Because I thought it was astonishing that he should send me there to do such a thins as that: another reason might be, that I had known, or heard, before, such thines were done; that people had been in custody; and I heard of one man in particular, mat had done it, that was an acqudntance of both of us, a Mr. Wardlow.*

Did you set out for Portsmouth?— ^I did.

What did you do with respect to these commissions he gave you?— I wrote him different letters, acquainting him of some ships that arrived,' and some that sailed.

Do you recollect any particular ships you sent him an account of any thing that passed upon the subject?— ^The first thing in particular was about the sailing of admuttl Kodney's fleet: he in different letters desired me to send him an account of it.

Did you do so?— I did not Just before that, I received a letter from him that gave me some uneasiness, and I resolved not to ^nd him any particular account. He was veiy urgent for me to send him the particulars of the fleet of admiral Rodney. I resolved to make some excuse for not sending it, and I did: I told him in two letters that I had advised him that the fleet had sailed, when indeed I had not sent him. any such advice; and I alluded, ifi one of my letters, to a list I pretended to have sent him a day or two before. I had another letter from him, desiring a captain Bowles to take a list of admi-

ral Rodney's ships, and to sail with it. Captain Bowles came to me, with an introductory letter from the prisoner to me, desiring that captain Bowles would take a list of that; and he enclosed a letter to me in captain Bowles's letter.

Were you to furnish captain Bowles with intelligence, by desire o£ tne prisoner?— Yes, for captain Bowles to tidce a list in his own hand-writing. Captain Bowles was to sail to Boulogne, or some pk)rt in France, to load wine, to run on board the East India ships.

Was Bowles to take that list with him to Boul^;ne?— He did not say he was to take it to France; but I have no doubt that was* the intention of it.

How long did you continue this intercourse with the prisoner, by letter, from Portsmouth?— I went up to London immediately aflerthis, and captain Bowles went with me.

What communication had vou with the prisoner in London?— A good deal at times. Captain Bowles and I were at his lodgings at several different times, aiKl captain Bowlear then went down to Gosport a^in; and he was from Gosport to go with his ship either to Chichester, or to some other port upon the coast.

Was that said in the presence of the prisoner?— It was.

And what was to be done there?— The prisoner was to meet him there, and to give hyn his dispatches about his business.

Did you say any thing to the prisonei^ aflerwardSj at Gosport or Portsmouth?— Yes. The first tmie he came, captain Bowles Was returning.

Do you know what time thai was^ — ^The particular date I am not certain of, bui the >

Sueen's birth-day was one of the days he.was tiere.

What passed between him and you there?— He asked me many particulars about the ships that were expected, and told me a great many things relative both to the East aad West India fleets; and he asked a great many things of me concerning them: thaC was the East India .fleet that was to sail shortly under sir Richard Bickerton.

Who was with him during his stay at Gosport?— His wife and captain Bowles.

Did you see any thing of any packet of the prisoner's writing while you was at the Crowninn?— Yes; but that was when he came the second time.

What was that day?— The general fastrday. I know it was.

He came again, then, on the fast-day?— He did.

Who was with him?— ^His wife.

What did jrou see him do?— r-I saw both him and his wife writing letters at the Crowninn. I think, either upon the Sunday or the Saturday afler this, I think i^was the Sunday after this evening captain James was there: he said to captsyui Jame^> he might as 

man and his accomplices, to convict the prisoner; in which case if they succeed, as it appears to me, you will be led to say upon your oaths, by your verdict of guilty, that a smuggling trade to and from France is evidence, upon the face of it, of a treasonable correspondence with the king's enemies rending in France. What does James's evidence amount to?— He says, it was a bargain for 15/. to go to France for wines, and that ,the prisoner gave him signals; respecting which signals a great deal has been said, ana to which a ereat many observations have been pointed. But what comes out upon the evidence of James f The sifi;nals were such as were to introduce him to tne purpose for which he went; the sictaIs were such, as persons there accustomed to traffic with £ndish smugglers well knew, and were to call out the traders of that country to carry on this traffic with him. He asked of the prisoner, pu;cording to his storv, whether he could go on shore, and was told in answer, that pnK> bably he might, under restrictions, and under peculiar circumstances; but no sailor belonging to the cutter was at any rate to go on shore; nothing was to be permitted that could introduce a correspondence between the crew of his vessel, ana the people on the coast of France, nothine that might be turned to the disadvantage of this country, in any way whatever. Tne sigmds that were given him, were, not what we had reason to iear, when this prosecution was first opened; not the signals of the fleet of Great Britain, by the communication of which, the enemy ndght learn how to deceive and entrap our fleets and squadrons: they were not the siglials of the East or West-India convoy; but merely signals to be made use of by this ^fimuggler, when he came upon the coast of France, in order to call out the people who were desirous to sell their wares to nim> to inform them that he was there ready to receive them; and, lest he - should not find a market that would pay for the expence of the duties to the crown, upon his return to England, he was as well possessed, I dare say, of signals to give the people' notice to come oft to' him, and receive his cargo upon our coast. This 'A all I can make out of the agreement between -James and the prisoner.

Then, gentlemen, a packet of letters and some other papers is produced to you, which, James says, was intrusted to his care by the prisoner. Let us consider, for a moment, of what does that packet consist. It was dk rected, on the outside cQvar, to captain James, for the purpose that he might take care of the whole 'contents together. It was intrusted to him; and he was to open it at a certain place, I think, off Dunnose; ^nd opening it, what was he to find?— Instructions for nis own cdnduct, which afford no ground ,6ven of suspicion. An drder addre^ed to ^n^eur J^ fbj certain quantities of the

best claret, and of some other wines, wMi which he was to traffic back to this country. He had farther instructions contained in this packet, that Mr. Lisle was to draw upon Mr. Brodelet for the price; and a letter of credit for 50/. was also given to the captain himself if he should want to take on board his venel a greater freight than that which composed the order for the prisoner. James was to have this credit for any thing he might tldok worth his while to purchase. It was .not, aa might strike you, gentlemen, at the first moment, fifty pounds given to James as a bribe to keep him quiet and secret, or to ^fo&fgt and secure his assistance in the business ofa treasonable correspondence: he would not venture to swear that; and the evidenoe, upon the face of the transaction itself, strongly proves the contrary. It was a letter of credit merely on the score of this illicit traffic; a traffic, I confess, to be blamed and censured, bift not a traffic ui>on which you are to deterrame that thejgrisoner has been guii^ of high-treason. Tnese orders however (or wine were given, it will be told you, upon different persons; and firom hence an inference will be drawn hostile to the prisoner. — But why?— The reason was explained by James himself why the orders were so given, and was, that if he could not make on^ port, there were correspondents at another, llie prisoner, it seems, carried on much of this illicit trade. What he wanted now,, was a psrtuular quantity of claret, a particular quantity of tea, or a particular quantity of brandy. James was to get these with all expedition. This was the object for which the prisoner sent him upon that voyage, and therefore he was to pursue ^e purposes for which he was sent. The counsel for the crown have attempted, it is true, by another letter contained m this packet, not in the hand-writing of the pri-' soner at the bar, to persuade you to believe that the smuggling was merely by way of colour fi>r concealment of the treasonable correspondence. And then, as to this letter not being of his writing, they say, that, being found in company wiUi his hand-wiiting, it is fiur to make use of it as evidence to you,* whereby to convince you of the prisoner's guilt.

Now, gentlemen, let us see for a moment, whether it is so or not. I am ready to confess to you, that under all the circumstances with which the papers were produced to you. It was competent for the counsel for the crown to give that letter in evidence; but vast suspicions hang upon it: ^d as for other circumstances in the case, so far that peculiarly you are to weigh well in your own minds the credit that is due to the two wxtoessea James and Harrison, one of whom has confessed explicitly, the other of whom has not ventured to deny, that one great object which tbey had in pursuing this matter with seal, was ta get Uie reward they expected; Hairison sa^ tng it will be. a job worth an hundred gjuis

aeas. And it has been admitted by this witness himself, that upon his first return from London, he said to James, You must go and make the business as black as^rou can against Tyrie. The inference is left for you, gentlemen, but it is an inference you cannot avoid drawmg. It was in order that, by his conviction, they might reap that reward which th^ were seeking. Besides which you will recollect, that I asxed the witness James concerning a conversation with a person of the name of Ramsey, upon the subject, aflerhis hay'mg given information upon oath at the Justices' office in Bow-street. The ftict is, he had a conversation with Mr. Ramsey; and in that conversation, as I am instructed, Ramsey will prove to you, though James had the hardiness himself in a degree to deny it, he told him that he had sworn at the pubhc office in Bow-street what he knew nothing about; that he had been carried there by Harrison; that he had sworn he did not know what; he had sworn to facts, of the truth of which he had no knowledge himself; bat it was what Harrison bid him say. This, gentlemen, I shall prove to you by Mr. Ramsey. And another circumstance you will remember is, that Harrison'^ rancour is demonstrated, as well as his eagerness to obtain a large reward for the conviction of the prisoner.

Under these circumstances, if you are not told by his lordship that the iact of the ph* soner's delivering the packet to James has not been proved by two witnesses, and that adl the contents of the cover which has come irom James's hand, are to be laid entirely out of the case, and ought to n»ke no part of the evidence which, in deciding upon the prisoner's innocence or guilt, you are to consider as the ground of your acqtutting him, pr finding him guilty; you will at least reflect that these papers come under your investigatioiL with singular marks of suspicion. One of the witnesses to the overt aet of sending 'this packet by James, whose name is Mailstone, appears in the light of an accomplice; and besides he gives'reasons for believing that the packet produced is not the one he saw: and you are wellaware, gentlemen, that it is not the question for you |o try simply, whether you consider that the prisoner at the bar deserves well of the community or ill. The jQpinton you ought to form of his character «nd connectionsy is not the point for you to determine and decide in the verdict you are to give: you are not to convict him of treason because he has been so wicked as to be coniiected with such men as the last witness called, Mailstone; with, such men as James and Harrison, or with others of whom we have heard. What the history of his life has been, or what his conduct has been, ought ibr a moment to be fctfgetten by you, or rather to be remembered witn this note, that it is not upon these you are now to decide.

The learned gentleman who opened the ^9se to you^ told you- well and properly^ who

the prisoner is, or what the prisoner is, or what have been his connections in life, are not matters for your consideration. Admit that he has pursued that loose and vagabond habit of Hfe Which leads men to defiraud<4he revenues of Hieir country, and to smug^e the produce of a foreign clime, even of an enemy's country, into his own; this is not a reason why you should find him guilty of the heinous ofience of high treason. You sre then to consider, gentlemen, the whole of the evidence which has been offered, and which will be stated to you with such observations from his lordship on the bench, as I am sure must do amole justice to the innocence of the prisoner, with respect to the charge now laid against him, notwithstanding any circumstance of criminality as a smuggler or otherwise. I am satisfied, that in the observations which will be made to you from the bench, where bis lordship will aid me by being also counsel for the prisoner at the bar, as far as, according to the truth and justice of the case, he ought to be counsel for him, his lordship will teUyou upon what points you are to lay the stress of your examination into the whole subject mat^ ter of the evidence that has been Uius brought before you, so as to draw a proper conclusion from it; and will convince you that it is by' no means a chain of evidence unbroken: by no means a body of circumstances whicn carry such conviction in the face of them, as is stronger than the positive testimony of ten thousand witnesses.

Such the circumstances were which the learned gentleman opened to you; but such are not the circumstances, in my opinion, which have been proved to you; such, I trust, you will find the circumstances have not been, when you come to weigh and consider and reconsider the evidence amongst yourselves, afler havine heard the whole testimony in detail laid before you by his lordship, with the observations which he is to make upon it. And if you do not, upon the whole body of this case, find that the circumstances are such as to convict the prisoner of high tre^on, then vou will not fina him guilty, whatever may be your opinion of his other offences; whatever may be your opinion of his conduct in this contraband traffic with an enemy's country; which was highly censurable in every possible way: for, although the trade of smuggling thus carried on is doubly wrong, yet, let it be wron^ in a degree as high as it may, this is not uie crime of high treason. The illicit trade of smuggling is the crime that is proved against the prisoner. High treason, in compassing the death 6f the king, and adhering to his enemies, is the crime charged against him. But, eentkmenofthe jury, the crime charged is what you must find by your verdict, m agreeing to find him guilty. If there* fiore you do not feel vourselves convinced, be^ yond a doubt, by wnatyoa have heard, or if the witness I shall call to contradict and ta destroy the weightof the testimony of Ja;nei^

tetl^bytiift fwmess 8n4 constslency of hta tiri«9 craaUk a doubi in y^ur minds which doe» HOl a)tea4y exist, tben I will v«BJliire to assure ^rott^thatin^eh a doubtful ca8« yoii ouglst to acquit. And I will only add, th«t if you abetdd not be perfectly convinced of tbe phaoMf's innocence, doubts of his guilt oi^ht to faAve the same opetation in. determintnc youy vordict, as proof of his innocence^ |i^ tbtfwibre^ you do entertain doubts, I am war-* santedin saying, under such circunstaiieesy. fiqd the prisoner guilty, if in common bonestji^ aad conmon sense you can, if in conacieoce^ and by the oath you have taken, you dare.

Bxasoined by Mr. Waison,

Have you had any conversation with Wm. James, the witness who was called just now, since the prisoner at the bar has been in custody, respecting him?— Yes.

^WiUidom. James called into Court.)

. Q. to JUufisey. Have you had any conversation with this man, respecting the prisoner, since his being in custody?— ^Ycs.

Where was it?— In Tothill-fields Bridewell. Mr. James asked me if I would take a walk to Tothill-fields Bridewell.

Pid you know Jam6s before?— Yes. Aceordingiy I went with him. Mrs. Tyrie, Mr. Tyrie'swife, was there present, drinking a glass of wine. She abused James terribly: She was in a terrible passion.

What did he say?— He said he knew nothing about it; it was not his fault tViat brought her there. Then she seemed to be moderate, and did not scold so much.

Relate exactly what James said.—:tle said he knew nothing of it; that it was not hb fau\t that she was brou^t there.

What was the conversation about, when he S£ud he knew nothing about it > — ^With regard to her being taken up. He said, Mr. Harrison had told him several times to paint the thing as black as he could. He was speaking to ]ms. Tyrie, but I was present. Mr. Mailstone was present at the time. «When we were examining at the office, in Bow-street, Mr. James said he was s^orn then, but he did not know what he was sworn to: being deaf, I presume he meant, but he did nol mention that; I understood so.

Court to James, Have you heard what this witness has siud?— ^Yes.

Court, What account do you. give of it?•— J; I went to see IVfo. Mailsione there. Mrs. Tyrie came into the room, and beg^n. to tidk to me very loudly; aadsaid^ she must thank me for behig there. .

After the Jury had ^ven in their XVdict, upon the Clerk of Arraigns putting to llie prisoner the usual question, " What nave you to say why judgment of death should not be passed upon you r" he replied, It is in vain for me to say any thing — poverty has been the cause of my conviction; because I had not the means to brin^ my witnesses here. However,! have a hope beyond the grave, and despise every thing that has been done to me.

I am in great confidence with the turnkeys; they say there is no talk of going; they are certain it won't be this week, and promise to give me notice the day before. — This cannot be depended on; but I will tell you how I think it might be reduced to a certatnty.— When I am removed, it will be either in the Winchester sta^e, or a postchaise; Mxdj in either case, I will go out of the gaol about five o'clock in the morning or rather half an hour sooner. Suppose tmn a person was to wait about the Ola B^ey and Newgate-street every morning. fVom about half at\er three till about six o'clock: let hitt fimt come into the gaol, and see my face and person. If I am removed suddenly, he can then come and give you notice; first following to see whether I go by the stage, or in a chaise: if in a chaise yrll jo from the door; if by the Stage, I'll go to the inn. — ^You can enauire where the Winchester staee iims. Bill Lee, and ^notiier creature like himself, are all that goes with Hie, at least so I am told; and them it is only who go with the prisoners removed at assize time.
