TYRIE's EXECUTION FOR HIGH TREASON.

Saturday Morning David Tyrie was brought from Winchester Gaol in a Coach and Six, accompanied by the Sheriff of Hants and his Attendants, he was met by the Officers and Constables of Portsmouth at the Green Post, and came in solemn Procession to the White-house, when he was taken out, and immediately put on a Hurdle with a Sledge, drawn by four Horses, and proceeded to South Sea Beach, where after some little Time spent in Reading, he suffered the whole Punishment according to the dreadful Sentence pronounced upon him.—We cannot help observing the Steadiness of Behaviour throughout the Whole, even from his Trial to his last Moments. The Annals of England cannot furnish a Circumstance wherein a Criminal launched into Eternity with so much Composure, not shewing the least Timidity, but seemed to think, to the last Moment, he acted in a right Cause. He said nothing material at the Place of Execution, nor gave the least Hint that any other Person was concerned with him. The Concourse of People assembled on this Occasion was great indeed; according to moderate Calculation, there could not be less than twenty thousand Persons. After hanging 22 Minutes and a Half, he was lowered down, his Heart was taken out and held up to the Populace, and the Hangman declared it to be the Heart of a Traitor: It was then thrown into the Fire, and his Body (the little Remains of it) was put into a Coffin, and buried near the Gallows.

It astonished every Spectator to see the horrid Inhumanity that was suffered on the remaining Part of the Carcase. The Populace had the Liberty of cutting and hacking any Part they thought proper, such as Fingers, Toes, and Ribs. This abominable Shock to human Nature, must certainly have been the Neglect of the Sheriff; and what was most palpable, to suffer the Gaoler of Gosport to take away Tyrie's Head, and which he is now making a Show of at his own Dungeon. Many of the Body-snatchers, as they are called, bid high for the Head; however, *Buck———* either having more Interest, or being quicker than the Rest, whipt it into a Bag, and some of his *worthy* Emisaries conveyed it away. It is sincerely to be hoped that such horrid Behaviour will not pass without exemplary Punishment.

The Crowd of People of all Ranks assembled by Four o'clock this Morning at the Gates of the Gaol, to see Tyrie set off for the Place of Execution, was very great. About Five o'Ciock he was put into a Coach with six Horses, attended by the Ordinary, Under-Sheriff, Gaoler, Sec. and conveyed to Portsmouth, where, being delivered up to the Mayor and Police of the Town, he was drawn on a Sledge the Place of Execution; after praying a little Time he was turned off, and hanging till almost dead, he was then cut down, his Head severed from his Body, his Bowels taken out, and his Heart shewn, to the surrounding Multitude, and then thrown into Fire made for the Purpose; the Body was then quartered and put into a Coffin.—The Concourse of People was immense, and beyond Description! and such was the Angular Avarice of many who were near the Body, that happy was he who could procure a Finger, or fome Vestige of the Criminal.—Tyrie supported to the last the same hardened Conduct as marked him his Condemnation, boldly leaping into the Coach at his leaving Winchester; and on his Journey to Portsmouth, his Words and Conduct, expressing great Indifference at his approaching Fate. Liverpool, Aug. 22.

Stamford Mercury - Thursday 29 August 1782

By a Gentleman who arrived in town last night from Portfmouth, we are informed that David Tyrie, who was convicted at the lat Winchester assize, for holding a treasonable correspondence with the French Ministry, was taken from the prison of that city, early on Saturday morning last, to Portfmouwth, where he was executed on a gibbet erected for the purpofe, in the presence of an immense crowd of people. The unhappy man it is said behaved throughout with such a decent fortitude that most of the spectators seemed sensibly affected at his misfortunes, and treated him with great tenderness at the place of execution. His body is to be hung in chains at the Gosport side, near Blockhouse fort.

Tyrie, a short time before execution, made a full discovery of his accomplices, one of them is in custody, and remains to be tried; but the prisoner has discovered, that his employment was a regular and well digested system of information, in the conveying of which no pains or expence was spared. It appears, that a certain American, who lately took atrip over to Paris, has been the principal planner and conductor of the scheme, and got his neck out of the halter, by suffering La Motte, Tyrie, and others, to be apprehended and executed, when he himfelf was the greater culprit. By some means or other these incendiaries not only got at the Admiralty orders, but they informed the French Court of the actual force and destination of our fleets long before they were equipped, and by such means rendered their expeditions abortive.

*Extract of a letter from Portsmouth, Aug. 24.*

"A crowd of people of all ranks assembled at four o'clock in the morning at the gates of the gaol, to see Tyrie set off to the place execution, was very great. About five o'clock he was put into coach with six horses, attended by the Ordinary, Under Sheriff, Jailor, &c. and conveyed to Portsmouth, where being delivered up to the Mayor and Police of the town, he was drawn on sledge to the place of execution. After praying a little time, he was turned off, and hanged till almost dead, when he was cut down, his head severed from his body, his bowels taken out, and his heart shown to the surrounding multitude, and then thrown into a fire made for that purpose; the bodv was then quartered, and put into a coffin. Tyrie supported to the last the same hardened conduct as marked him on his condemnation, boldly leaping, into the coach his leaving Winchester; and on his journey to Portsmouth, by words and conduct expressing great indifference at his approaching fate.

"It astonished every spectator to see the horrid inhumanity that was suffered on the remaining part of the carcase of Thyrie. The populace had the liberty of cutting and hacking any part they thought proper, such as fingers, toes and ribs. This abominable shock to human nature must certainly have been the neglect of the sheriffs; and what was most culpable, to suffer the Jailer of Gosport to take away Tyrie's head, ana which he is now making a shew of in his own dungeon."

*Extract of a Letter from Portsmouth, Sept. 6.*

An order came down this morning for the ships to take all their stores on board directly, which is now performing in the greatest haste imaginable.

"Lord Howe has not left his command his arrival.

"The First Lord of the Admiralty is expected to see the fleet sail, and it is evensaid will go as far as Plymouth in the Victory, where he will take a view the Dock-yard, during the absence of the grand fleet.

"We have now 1160 men, including labourers, employed this yard, and talk of employing 200 more before the spring; Indeed so much work calls for additional hands.

"The person who is to go down into the Royal George, tried the experiment in the harbour this morning, in the machine contrived for the purpose; and I have just been informed that great hopes of success are expected from it, as he was able to continue under water near an hour.

"A clear benefit of 90;. was last night given at the Sadlers Wells Theatre, near this town, to the widows and orphans of the persons lost in the Royal George. Another will be given at the Theatre in the town this evening by the Comedians."

A Correspondent has made the following observations respecting the Royal George.

The absolute weight of a body sinking a fluid is equal to such part of the fluid as shall be thrust away or displaced thereby.

It is now presumed, that the Royal Georre had all her ordnance, rigging, &c. on board and therefore by calculation she displaced, or removed, a body of sea water containing 21,965,978 pounds of water, which makes 9805 tons and upwards, which is egual to her weight. Now, supposing her to be sixteen fathom perpendicular under water, and admitting the truth of 64 pounds to be a solid foot of sea water, she sustains the weight of 20,9941/2 tons.

The ship's weight, upon a present computation, 9805 tons.

The perpendicular weight of water over her, 20994 1/2 tons.

Total, without considering the water in her body. 30799 1/2 tons.

He concludes with asserting that he can form a machine upon a simple construction, whereby she may be unloaded of her ordnance and stores.

As Tyrie was conducting to execution, he said the gaoler, "At this place I was to have been rescued, could I have raised money enough, for the Smugglers had offered do it, but demanded a sum greater than was in my power to give." He afterwards said, there was one man living yet, who furnished intelligence to the French, and while he lived, the navy of Great Britain would never be successful. After he was executed and buried in the sand, the sailors dug him up, pulled him to pieces, lapped his fingers and toes in rags to make tobacco-stoppers of, and carried his entrails in triumph on a stick.
