__Tales:__

- *Wish Ring* [frame tale] — a tale I first heard from Daniel Morden via his podcast during lockdown, I traced it back to a German tale from 1871. Using it as a frame tale is my contribution in this set. [`the-wish-ring.html`]

- *Stone soup* — a "standard" story, widely told, in many variants; see my notes at. [`axe-porridge-stone-soup.html`]

- *Tinker King Lamp* — a tale I found in a collection of tales orally collected from Duncan Williamson, *The King And The Lamp: Scottish Traveller Tales*. I did hear Duncan telling tales back in the day at *Festival at the Edge*, but I don't specifically recall having heard him tell this one.

- *Sweetseller Lamp* — a tale I found in Richard Hamilton's *The Last Storytellers: Tales from the Heart of Morocco*, a treasure trove of a book gifted to me by my fellow *'Tis Tales* teller, Holly Medland.

- *Too much time* — this was something I stumbled across, somewhen, when looking for stories that particularly related to time. The current notes do not include the 1000 mile an hour line I developed particularly for this outing of the set. [`too_much_time.html`]

*My original starting point for putting together a set for a Steampunk Festival was to riff on the idea: __"what tales from our oral tradition might have continued be told in the steampunk universe just after the fork?"__ I went down one rabbit hole that particularly seemed to focus on death traditions, another based on Luddite tales. Neither felt quite right, and I ended up returning to the tales from my first solo set, re-ordered to fit the use of the Wish Ring as a frame tale, and with Too Much Time as possible source for twisty turns to chat over in a Steampunk bar. I'm happy to discuss over a pint why I think each of the stories are relevant in this performance context ;-)*
