# Who Killed the Bear?

After hearing a fragment of this local tale from a lifelong resident of Ross-on-Wye — Emma's "Uncle Tim" — and a clue that local writer Dennis Potter had written a (television) play inspired by the tale ([*The Beast with Two Backs*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Beast_With_Two_Backs)), I set out to do a little digging...

The misremembered tale went something like the following, which owes rather more to Dennis Potter's play than to its historical origins:

> A woman was murdered in the Forest. One of a the men in a group of travelling showman with a dancing bear was scapegoated to be the murderer. A group of vigilantes tracked him down, killed his bear, and perhaps murdered him?

The actual tale differs slightly — there was no murder of a woman, though there was a rumour that a child had been killed, and a woman hurt, by the bears — but still needs to be handled carefully, by all accounts. For I'm told that if you ask of the wrong crowd, even to this day, "so who killed the bear?", a fight might ensue...

The story dates back to April, 1889, in the Forest.

FIGHT WITH BEARS IN THE FOREST OF DEAN.

TWO FRENCHMEN BEATEN.

A Forest of Dean correspondent sends the following extraordinary story:— A very remarkable affair has occurred in Dean Forest, in which four Frenchmen were subjected to rough treatment at the hands of the colliers and others living in the neighbourhood of Ruardean Hill, near Cinderford. Two Russian bears which the foreigners had with them were killed. It appears that the Frenchmen arrived on Friday morning at Cinderford. They were accompanied by two Russian bears of ordinary size. The animals were muzzled, and each was in charge of two keepers. They exhibited about the town till about three o'clock the afternoon, and then took the road for Nailbridge *en route* for Drybrook, Ruardean, and Lydbrook. The party was followed out of the town by many small children. Somewhere in the neighbourhood of Nailbridge the report was started that a child had been killed at Cinderford, and a woman very much hurt, at the same time and place, by the bears. The report, it seems, was a pure fabrication, but the poor Frenchmen and their quadrupeds who had been objects of interest at once received the attention of a hostile mob. Without inquiring as to the truth of the story, scores of young fellows and boys who had collected intimated their intention to despatch the brutes. To this end stakes were torn up, garden clothes props, stones, brick bats, and other weapons, were used to attack the bears. Their keepers, unable to speak a word of English, went down on their knees and in great distress implored, by gestures, to be left alone. Their entreaties ware in vain, and several times the men were struck either with sticks or stones, and one received a serious blow in the neck with a half brick. In this way a couple of miles were traversed, and at six o'clock was estimated that a mob of 200 persons had collected. The bears became very excited and in the middle of the road within sight of Ruardean the smaller of the two beasts was killed outright by a heavy pole which someone levelled at its head. Two of the Frenchmen escaped into a wood, and they have not been seen nor heard of since. The other two, worn out with fatigue and fright, sank to the ground, thus letting the second animal free. The beast jogged on as fast as it could, but was again captured and was shot dead. Some persons who took pity on the strangers invited them into their houses and gave them shelter. The neighbourhood continued in a most excited state for some time. Much sympathy is expressed for the strangers, who have lost their means of livelihood.

We are informed that the French Vice-Consul in Gloucester (Mr. J. B. Karn) has received a communication from Mr. M. F. Carter, of Newnham, stating that proceedings will be taken against some of the men alleged to have been concerned in the affray; that the magistrates have power to make a grant of £10 compensation for the loss of the bears, and suggesting that the Frenchmen do not speak English Mr. Karn had better attend at Littledean Police-court when the cases came on, as interpreter, or make proper arrangements. The French Consul at Cardiff communicated with Mr. Karn this morning by telegram requesting that he would take what steps might be deemed advisable for asserting the rights of the Frenchmen concerned. The two men who escaped into the woods have arrived at Cardiff. The matter is considered of such importance that Mr. Karn this afternoon proceeded to the Forest to make inquiries on the spot, preparatory to taking what action may be considered necessary.
```

The police response was rapid, with what appear to be co-ordinate arrests made late at night, either to prevent any of the miscreants fleeing, or perhaps to reduce the chances of public disorder arising directly from any attempt to make the arrests.

THE OUTRAGE ON FRENCHMEN IN THE FOREST OF DEAN. 

Late last night Superintendent Ford and a number of extra policemen succeeded in arresting George Wilkes, Robert Wilkes, William Williams, William Baldwin, Ernest Cinderby, Henry Baldwin, George Rawlins, Joseph Hopkins, Thomas Meek, Isaac Baldwin, Joseph Hardwick, Sidney Rawlins, George Tippins, and Arthur Golding, colliers and labourers of Ruardean neighbourhood, on the charge of unlawfully and maliciously killing two bears, contrary to the statute, being the property of four Frenchmen, who it is stated belong to the Pyrenees district. The prisoners are lodged in Littledean lock-up. In a second warrant the prisoners are charged with assaulting these men. The arrests, which were affected quietly, was unexpected, but that course was in deference to the justices' wishes in the district. The two men who escaped to Cardiff arrived at Newnham to-day at noon. Mr. George Ealing, French Consul General, Cardiff, will probably attend Littledean to-morrow to conduct the prosecution. The feeling in the Forest is relieved now that so many arrests have been made.
```

The arrested men, ranging in age from 15 to ~50, were swiftly placed before a court, where a large crowd had gathered. One of the magistrates had to excuse himself on the grounds that he had already written to the local papers condemning the actions of the men and proposing a subscription fund on behalf of the Frenchmen mistreated by the black faced coalmen.

THE OUTRAGE ON FRENCHMEN IN DEAN FOREST.

POLICE COURT PROCEEDINGS

The conduct of an enraged but cowardly mob at Ruardean, by which two dancing bears were slain and two Frenchmen were badly beaten, as reported in another column, was made the subject of a searching magisterial inquiry at Littledean Police-court yesterday. The magistrates present on the Bench were Messrs. R. J. Kerr, M. W. Colchester-Wemyss, A. Thomas, and A. Bright. George Wilkes, Robert Wilkes, William Baldwin, Ernest Cinderby, Henry Baldwin, George Rollins, Joseph Hopkins, Thomas Meek, Isaac Baldwin, Joseph Hardwick, Sidney Rollins, George Tippins, and Arthur Golding, colliers and labourers of Ruardean neighbourhood, were charged with that they, on the 26th of April in the township of East Dean, in the parish of Ruardean, did unlawfully and maliciously kill two bears, the property of Gabriel Qugant Yas, Gabriel Balent Huguet, Thomas Biernés Sirgant, and Alfred Gerand; with having at the same time and place unlawfully assaulted and beaten the four French subjects, and with ill-treating and torturing the two bears at the same time and place. The ages of the men charged varied from 15 to 49. The prosecution was conducted by Mr. M. F. Carter, magistrates' clerk. The interests of the Frenchmen were watched by Mr. W. Langley-Smith, instructed by Mr. J. B. Karn, French Consul at Gloucester. Mr. F. F. Goold, barrister, instructed by Mr. Bradstock, defended George Wilks, Robert Wilks, Ernest Cinderby, Thomas Meek, William Baldwin, and George Tippins; and Mr. Whatley defended George Rollings, Isaac Baldwin, Arthur Golding, Joseph Hopkins, and Sydney Rollings.

William Henry Leach, of Gloucester, acted as interpreter. The greatest interest was manifested in the proceedings. A large crowd collected outside the Courthouse Yard long before time at which the Court is opened, but none but witnesses and persons having other business were admitted.

Mr. M. W. Colchester-Wemyss said that he had written a letter to the newspapers regarding the case only last night—if he had not, the object with which he had written would have been delayed for a week—and therefore he would retire from the Bench. Mr. Goold and Mr. Whatley said they would have no objection to Mr. Wemyss adjudicating, but the Chairman thought it better for him not to do so. He therefore retired.

The case of assaulting the men was first taken. Gabriel Balent Huguet, a native the south of France, said that he was with three other Frenchmen and two performing bears, working Cinderford, and when leaving on the day in question many children followed them. At the bottom of the town some men joined the crowd. They came behind them saying something which they could not understand, and throwing stones at them. Witness recognised Wilkes, sen., being one who was there throwing stones, and hitting him with short sticks. Over 40 men were there. He could not recognise any others for they had black faces and different clothes on. They were continually beaten, and witness could not tell when the children left. Witness was hit with a stone in the back and with a stick in the side, and was twice knocked down and kicked. He at last became unconscious. He could not say whereabouts he was left, for there were no houses. He could not say what public-houses they were near when they were commenced to be beaten. (P.C. White here stated that they were the Old Inn and the Engine.)— Cross-examined by Mr. Goold: It was about seven or half-past when he saw the prisoner Wilkes. Wilkes came out of a house on the roadside, but witness could not say whether it was a private or a public-house. The first blow that he received was from a stone on the back of the head, and he could not recognise anyone. Wilkes was the man who hit him with the stick. When he was first knocked down he did not lose his memory.— By Mr. Whatley: The occurrence took place some time after six o'clock. They were then within sight of the public-houses.

Gabriel Qugant Yas was examined, and said that he was with the last witness and remembered about forty men following them after leaving the town. They threw stones and then beat them with sticks. Witness was not knocked down. He recognised Wilkes. The assaults of the crowd continued right up where the second bear was let go (Ruardean). By Mr. Goold: Wilkes motioned them to get along the road as there was a crowd with them. His pole was taken from him, and he had not seen it since. Witness was not the one who picked up the last witness.

Thomas Biernès Sirgant estimated the crowd at about 30. While they were in the town the people were very civil to them, but just before they got into the other village they commenced to attack them. He was not touched, for he was one of those who got away. Witness was present when his bear was killed. He recognised Wilkes.

Alfred Gerand estimated the number of people present about 35 or 40. He saw his partner (the first witness) felled with a stone, and he picked him up. Huguet was knocked down a second time. Witness got away to Cardiff, stopping in the wood all night. The first man to commence the attack was Wilkes. When Huguet was felled, he said, "Leave me here, and save your own life."

James Barnett, Nailbridge, Milsom Symonds, a lad, Benjamin Kirkhouse, Ruardean, Henry Vick, the Morse, Arthur Vick, Arthur John Brain, Mark Westaway, and Henry Jones also gave evidence describing the brutal attack upon the men and their bears. Clothes-props, sticks, and stones were used.

This concluded the evidence for the prosecution and Mr. Goold, in addressing the bench for the defence, submitted that because any one of the prisoners was in a crowd which assaulted the Frenchmen was no evidence against them. He also asked them to take into consideration that the men were apprehended on this charge, and had not had a chance of collecting evidence on their behalf. He proceeded to review the evidence against each of his clients.

Mr. Whatley having endorsed Mr. Goold's remarks as to the regretability of the occurrence, proceeded to defend his clients.

The Chairman said that as far as the present charge was concerned, George Rollings, Golding, Hopkins, Henry Baldwin, and Hardwick would be discharged. The next case was then proceeded with. Milsom Symonds repeated his evidence. He identified several of the prisoners as being present in the crowd. George and Robert Wilkes and Henry Baldwin struck one of the bears with sticks across the head, ribs, and back. Farther along he saw William Williams and Henry Baldwin strike the bears. He saw Henry Baldwin throw stones on to the back of one of the bears when it was on the ground. He could not say who killed the bear, there were so many beating it. Considerable corroborative evidence was given. Gabriel Huguet said he and his partners bought the larger bear when about four or five months old, giving 850 francs (£32 10s.) for Thomas Sirgant said he gave 1000 francs (£4O) for the other bear. The bear had been about four months in training.

The Chairman said there was evidence against Thomas Meek, Tippins, Sidney Rollings, and Hardwick, in this case.

The magistrates retired for some considerable time, and delivering judgment the Chairman said they had taken some time to consider their decision, not because they had any doubt as to the assault having been committed, but to whether they should give prisoners the option of a fine. They had determined after considerable doubt to give them the option paying a fine, but they would make it a very heavy fine, and it would have to be paid on the spot. The case was a most disgraceful one fact the most disgraceful that had come before him on the bench. These Frenchmen were going harmlessly about the country, and had been attacked by a mob of people on a cry which had no foundation whatever. They considered George Wilkes be the worst offender, and next to him Tippins, Cinderby and Thomas Meek. For the assault G. Wilkes, Cinderby, Tippins and Meek would be fined £5 each, and in default month's imprisonment; and Robert Wilkes, Henry Baldwin, and Sidney Rollings 10s. each, or seven days. For killing and attacking the bears George Wilkes was fined and £30 damages, or a month, Cinderby £1 and £5 damages, or a month, and Robert Wilkes, Henry Baldwin, George Rollings, Joseph Hopkins, Isaac Baldwin, and Arthur Goulding £1 and £5 damages each, or days, costs to follow in each case. Hardwick and William Baldwin were discharged.

Mr. J. B. Karn, addressing the bench, said he had been desired by the Frenchmen to thank Mr. Carter for the very able, efficient, and courteous way in which had looked after their interests.

The fines and damages together amounted to £84 10s., and in nearly every case the money was paid.

Mr. J. B. Karn informed our representative yesterday that far from its being the intention of Mons. Jacquemin, French Consul General at Cardiff, to conduct the case himself, he had written to him (Mr. Karn) thanking him for the trouble had taken in the matter, and leaving the case entirely in his hands. The Frenchmen, and particularly the old man, have not yet fully recovered from the attack, and have appeared very anxious to make the best of their way back to their native land. They were last night sent to Cardiff by Mr. Karn, and they will be sent thence at the earliest opportunity by Mons. Jacquemin. The subscription list opened in South Wales amounts at present to £36.

Mr. Colchester-Wemyss writes from Westbury Court, under Thursday's date:— Many of your readers will have heard of the most barbarous assault upon four innocent Frenchmen, and their two equally innocent four-footed companions last Friday the Forest of Dean. As I shall be one of the magistrates who will have to try the Friday, it is obvious I can do no more than mention the occurrence, and simply express on behalf of at least 99 out of every 100 my neighbours our utter abhorrence of what has transpired. I have, however, been requested in several quarters to endeavour to offer to these poor foreigners, and through them to the friendly nation to which they belong, some more tangible expression of public sympathy than mere words. I propose therefore to open a subscription list on their behalf, and shall be most happy to receive any contributions myself, or they may be paid to an account which will be opened for this purpose with The Capital and Counties Bank at Newnham. I would add that it is not so desirable that the individual subscriptions should be of a considerable amount, as that the number of subscribers should be large. This would furnish practical assurance to our neighbours cross the Channel, that, although the event has cast a stain upon the fair name of our county, it is repudiated by all in every class whose opinion is worth anything. I shall feel greatly obliged by your insertion of this letter in your next issue. Receipt of subscriptions will be acknowledged by public advertisement.

Gertrude Sey, a member of the Band of Mercy, of 19, Porchester-square, Hyde Part, London, writes expressing the shame and grief which she felt reading of the conduct of the Foresters and saying that never before was she glad that she escaped by a narrow space from being born a Forester. She concludes: "Are those foreigners to go home and say that they visited a part of England where the men are worse than the beasts of their own land—that they were stoned and ruined in the Forest of Dean? Surely there should for the honour of the Forest (if such a thing remains) be a subscription to refund the men for their loss."
```

The story was, unsurprisingly, deemed notable enough to merit an editorial comment, that mentions in passing, but does not describe, a "latent superstition in connection with such animals". *I haven't found any 19th century descriptions about what this tradition might be, but 21st century write-ups such as [this one from the BBC in Gloucestershire](https://www.bbc.co.uk/gloucestershire/weirdwest/2004/11/bear.shtml) suggest the legend that the dancing bears were "fed on the flesh of children".*

The Forest of Dean has obtained anything but a pleasant notoriety during the past week. No matter from what cause the attack upon the itinerant Frenchmen and their two bears arose, whether from the rumour said to be circulated that one of the bears had killed a child, or from a latent superstition in connection with such animals, it was not the correct thing for a large mob to pursue the strangers, and so shamefully beat them with sticks and injure them with stones that the bears were killed and their keepers almost despaired of life. Had not the matter been taken up with commendable promptitude and delicate negociations in connection with the un-English assault been conducted with despatch and diplomatically, the Foresters' action might have had consequences of a much more serious nature than the proceedings at the Littledean Police Court yesterday. We have only to imagine four of our countrymen treated in a similar manner in a French village to realise the feelings experienced by our neighbours on reading of the assault. But all's well that ends well; and another equally trite if equally stale proverb is that which says that the least said is the soonest mended. We certainly are interested in letting the matter drop now that justice has been done. But even a case in which so much is unsatisfactory has one bright and pleasant gleam. One of the poor fellows, beaten and terrified as he lay, as he thought, dying, begged his fellow traveller not to think of him but to save his own life. This was true heroism.

In another report of the court proceedings, a rather humourous incident involving a travelling bear in Gloucester several years earlier at the appropriately named "New Bear Inn" was recalled.

FOREST OF DEAN DISTRICT.

COWARDLY ATTACK ON FRENCHMEN.

An extraordinary outrage is reported having been committed on Friday. Four Frenchmen, accompanied by couple of performing bears, visited Cinderford on that day. The bears were muzzled, and each was in charge of two keepers. In the afternoon they left for Drybrook, Ruardean, and Lydbrook. In the neighbourhood of Nailbridge a report was started that a child had been killed at Cinderford, and a woman very much hurt, by the bears. The report was a fabrication, but the poor Frenchmen and their companions, who had been objects of interest, were at once attacked by a mob. Scores of young fellows and boys armed themselves with stakes, clothes props, stones, brickbats, and other weapons, to attack the bears. Their keepers, unable to speak a word of English, went on their knees and in great distress implored, by gestures, to be left alone. Their entreaties were in vain, and several times the men were struck either with sticks or stones, and one of them received a serious blow in the neck with a brick. In this way couple of miles were traversed, and at six o’clock it was estimated that a mob of 200 persons had collected. The bears became very excited, and in the road within sight of Ruardean the smaller of the two beasts was killed by a heavy pole which someone levelled at its head. Two of the Frenchmen escaped into a wood, and found their way to Cardiff, and communicated with the Consul. The other two, worn out with fatigue and fright, sank to the ground, letting the second bear free. The beast jogged on as fast as it could, but was again captured and was shot dead. Some persons who took pity on the strangers invited them into their houses and gave them shelter. Much sympathy was expressed for the strangers, who have lost their means of livelihood.

Early in the week Mr. Maurice Carter, magistrates' clerk, informed Mr. J. B. Karn, French Consul at Gloucester, that proceedings will be taken against some of the men alleged to have been concerned in the affray: that the magistrates have power to make a grant of £10 compensation for the loss of the bears; and suggesting that, as the Frenchmen do not speak English, Mr. Karn had better attend at Littledean petty session, as interpreter, or make proper arrangements. Mr. Karn went to the Forest make enquiries, preparatory to taking such action in the affair as he might deem advisible. A subscription has been started at Cardiff for the unfortunate Frenchmen.

This affair with the bears in the Forest reminds us of some adventures which have occurred with French bruins in Gloucester. Over thirty years ago there stood on the site of the present Wellington Hall a public-house called the New Bear Inn, which had attached to it lock-up stables. One night a travelling Frenchman stabled his dancing bear at this appropriately-named place of call, and some of the *habitués* of the inn, which was kept by Mr. Cobb, seized the opportunity of playing a practical joke (and it might have been a fatal one) on a small tradesman who went by the cognomen of "Rush". "Rush"  had a penchant for rabbits or anything in the "fur" line, and a suggestion to him that be might easily annex Mr. Cobb's rabbits required no pressing on him. After dark "Rush" proceeded to the stable in which he fondly imagined the "bunnies" were hutched, and on drawing the staple from the door and opening it he was startled to find himself "planted" in the tight embraces of the Frenchman’s bear, who resented this nocturnal intrusion by an utter stranger. The cries and shrieks of "Rush" brought speedy assistance from the "New Bear", and he was rescued more dead than alive from the clutches of the "old 'un." He was very sore whenever a bear was mentioned afterwards. Some dozen years ago we ourselves remember having seen a Frenchman in a blue blouse and a bear baled before the magistrates charged with creating an obstruction in the public streets. Restless "Bruin" could not resist showing off some of his antics to the bench, but he was not punished for contempt of court, for he and his frightened master, whose *patois* was difficult to comprehend, were let off on the promise of the latter to make himself and his zoological charge scarce in Gloucester.

PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE MAGISTRATES.

At the Littledean petty session yesterday (before Russell J. Kerr, M. W. Colchester-Wemyss, A. Thomas, and A. Bright, Esqrs.), Geo. and B. Wilks, W. Williams, Isaac and H. Baldwin, E. Cindery, G. Rawlins, J. Hopkins, T. Meek, Jos. Hardwick, Sydney Hawkins, Geo. Tippins, and Arthur Golding, were charged in custody with killing two bears, the property of Gabriel Dogault Tas, Gabriel Bulint, Sirgaut Thomas, and Gerald Alfred, Frenchmen, on 26th April, and assaulting the persons named. Mr. Langley Smith appeared for complainants, and the prisoners were defended by Mr. F. Goold, of the Oxford Circuit, and Mr. Whatley. Mr. Leach, Gloucester, acted as interpreter. Mr. Colchester-Wemyss intimated that in consequence of a letter he had addressed to the newspapers he should not adjudicate in the case. The prisoners elected to have the case disposed of by the bench. Dugault deposed that at Cinderford they were performing with bears, and some children followed. Later a number of men came up and began throwing stones. George Wilks hit him with stick on his side and head. The attack went on, and they went on as quick as possible. Twice he was knocked down and kicked, and left where he lay insensible. Some one took him into a house. Cross-examined: Wilks was foremost, and once hit him with stick. The other complainants stated that about 40 men were after them, and forced them along. The pole they had was taken from them. One of them said he saw his partner knocked down, and picked him up. When he got to the wood he remained there all night.

Several other witnesses were examined; and then the charge of cruelty to the bears was gone into. The prisoners were convicted. George Wilks, Cindery, Tippins, and T. Meek were each fined £5, in default a month's hard labour; Robert Wilks, H. Baldwin, and Sawlins were each fined 10s. or seven days. The others were discharged. For the injury to the bears Wilks was fined £1, and damage, in default a month’s hard labour; Cindery and Rawlins, £1 and £5 damage, or a  month; Wilks, H. Baldwin, Hopkins, J. Baldwin, and A. Golding £1, £5 damage, or 14 days. The others to pay all costs before being discharged.

LATEST INTELLIGENCE

Dancing bears are sometimes useful in preventing theft. At Massegros, in France, a bear which had been lodged in the pigsty of a farmer hugged two thieves who came steal the pig so severely that one died, and the second is dangerously ill. A third was so frightened that it is feared he will lose his reason.

A PIG-STEALING ADVENTURE— A tragic termination to an amusing incident was witnessed a few days ago at Massegros, France. A man with a dancing bear arrived in the evening, and begged a lodging of a farmer for himself and his charge. The bear was accordingly turned into the pigsty after the pig had been removed to another shelter. In the middle of the night three malefactors appeared on the scene, with the intention of stealing the farmer's pig. The result can easily be imagined. The bear gave the men a warm reception, promptly flooring the two who ventured into the sty before they discovered the substitution of the animals. The third robber was petrified with fright at the fate of his companions, but managed to shout for help and the farmer and bear-keeper were soon on the spot. They found the first man quite dead; the second is still dangerously ill; and it is feared that the pig-stealing adventure has destroyed the reason of the other.

Caught at Last.

Not long ago an innkeeper a certain village had a sow and seven little pigs. One night a thief came and stole one of the pigs. The master inquired of his neighbours if they had seen or heard of the missing squeaker, but they had not, and he determined to inform the police. A few nights after, however, another pig was stolen, then another, and it seemed he was going to lose the lot. One day an Italian came to the inn, and brought a dancing bear with him. He proposed staying for the night, and the innkeeper not having vacant place for the bear, offered the use of the pig-sty, which the Italian accepted. The last pig and the sow were accordingly removed to other quarters. It happened that the thief came again that night, and was groping in the dark for the last pig when the bear caught hold of him, and hugged him. His cries soon brought the Italian and the landlord on the scene. The thief was terrified, and asked forgiveness, which after a time was granted on condition that he brought back the whole of the porcine family, He was of course thankful to be let off easily. The alarm caused much amusement in the neighbourhood.

Reports of the incident were also published outside of the immediate local area.

THE FOREST OF DEAN INCIDENT.

WHOLESALE ARRESTS.

The Forest of Dean bear fight is regarded in so serious a light that warrants were granted to the police against the following PERSONS:—George Wilks, Robert Wilks, William Williams, William Baldwin, Earnest Cinderley, Henry Baldwin, George Rawlins, Joseph Hopkins, Thomas Meek, Isaac Baldwin, Joseph Hardwick, Sidney Rawlins, George Tippins, and Arthur Golding. These men all live in one locality, and are mostly colliers. They were apprehended at night, and at nearly the same time, and in so quiet a manner that only a few outsiders knew what was taking place. They were taken to Littledean lock-up. The charge against the prisoners is that on the evening of the 26th April they "then did unlawfully and maliciously kill certain animals, to wit, two bears, the same being animals ordinarily kept in confinement, contrary to the statute", and being the property of Gabriei Quagauet, James Gabriel Baluil, Twigant Thomas, and Geraut Alfred, Frenchmen, said to belong to the Pyrenees district. In a second charge the prisoners are proceeded against for assaulting the Frenchmen. The two last named persons, who managed to escape to Cardiff, returned to the Forest, having arrived at Newnham station at noon on Thursday, The Consul-General at Cardiff and Mr Karn, vice-consul, Gloucester, are arranging that the foreigners shall be properly represented at Littledean to-day (Friday).

William Williams was charged with assault and cruelty in connection with the recent attack on four Frenchmen and their two bears. Mr. Whatley appeared for the prisoner. Evidence of the attack on the Frenchmen and their bears was given, Williams being among those who followed the men, but it was contended that he was not one of those who struck one of the bears with a stick.

THE ATTACK ON FRENCHMEN IN THE FOREST.

At the Little dean Petty Sessions yesterday, William Williams, collier, of Nailbridge, a warrant for whom was out last week for his arrest in connection with the assault on the four Frenchmen and bears near Cinderford, surrendered to his bail charged with assaulting Gabriel Qugant Yas, Gabriel Baluit Huguat, Thomas Sirgant, and Alfred Gerand, and with assaulting and killing their bears at Ruardean on the 26th ult.

Mr. Whatley appeared to defend the prisoner. As before, the case of the assault on the men was taken first.

Milsom Simmonds, labourer, of Morse Lane, repeated the evidence he gave last week, which was to the effect that he saw the four Frenchmen and two bears in the Morse-road and a mob following, throwing stones. At Ruardean, where there were a couple of hundred people, Williams struck at one of the bears with clothes-prop, which he obtained at Mark Knight's, and in doing so struck one of the men over the shoulder. Witness had known Williams five or six years. Cross-examined: Witness saw the occurrence from the top of a wall opposite Williams' house. He saw Williams on Thursday and said "If you say you caught hold of my arm to prevent my throwing stones I shall say you struck one of the men with a pole." Although Mr. Whatley had a witness to swear to the contrary, he (Simmonds) would swear that he did not throw stones, and that Williams did not catch hold of him. Williams did not tell him not to throw stones. He said something to him, but he did not know what he said. Mr. Whatley: If you know that he did not tell you to fling stones, what did he say? Witness, in answer, now said that Williams did not speak to him. He did not see Kirkhouse and Williams holding the gate to keep the people back from getting into Knight's. Further pressed, witness said that he saw Kirkhouse holding the gate two or three moments after the blow was struck. Simmonds, examined with regard to the second case, said the little bear was killed near the Pike at Ruardean. Witness saw Williams strike the bear with a short stick, and and *(sic)* others threw stones on to his back. The bear only survived about ten minutes after this. By Mr. Whatley: Witness did not strike the bear, but he had a stick. He did not throw a stone.

Henry Vick deposed to seeing the bear killed. Williams was present, but he did not see him strike it. Witness made a statement to the police. He saw Williams leading the bigger bear with the chain, and he saw him deliver the bear to the mob. The statement produced was the one which he made to the police. This statement was to the effect that William Williams (and others) were using sticks at the time the bear died. Cross-examined: When he saw Williams father he told him that Williams only led the bear with the chain. Before the bear was shot at by Bond Williams had let go of it.—P.C. White said he had a warrant for the arrest of Williams at the same time as the others. He went to his home to arrest him at twelve o'clock at night, but could not find him. Williams gave himself up at the police-station on Tuesday. He knew Williams as a very respectable man. Witness met him on the night of the assault, and Williams then said that he had had nothing to do with it.

Mr. Whatley asked if the Bench thought it was sufficient evidence to convict. He had several witnesses to call.

The magistrates decided to hear them. Mr. Whatley explained that why prisoner did not give himself up was because he thought the time was too short for him to get sufficient evidence to clear himself. He gave himself up directly he advised him.

Benjamin Kirkhouse, for the defence, said he saw Williams at Knight's. Witness arrived there before him. The bear was struck there, but not by Williams. Witness had not known Williams before the 26th of April. He knew nothing about the killing of the second bear.

Joseph Kent said that when the Frenchman was knocked down Williams went to assist him. Witness saw Williams far as Mark Knight's, and during that time he did not see Williams do anything. He did not see Williams while the men and the bears were in at Knight's. Bond wanted to shoot the bear while Williams had hold of him, but the latter said "No, let us take him back up." Cross-examined: Williams had said "Let us take it back to the White Hart and deliver it to the Frenchman." He did nothing prevent the bear being killed.

Arthur Vick corroborated as to Williams's action with regard to the second bear. Williams did his best to prevent the bear being killed, but the mob would not let him take it back.

Mr. Whatley read from P. C. White's book a statement made by witness which corroborated this.

Thomas Cooksey, a fireman, of Nailbridge, said that when the old Frenchman was knocked down Williams said "Let him alone; let them go on." Later on Williams tried to prevent the crowd throwing stones. He saw Williams talk to Mr. Charlton, and the latter tried to prevent the mob following the Frenchmen. Witness saw Simmonds throwing stones and Williams tried to prevent him. This witness also corroborated as to the action taken by Williams in bringing the second bear back. Cross-examined: Witness was present from to end of the occurrence but could not say who beat the bear. On Mr. Carter mentioning some names witness said he saw Robert Wilkes strike the bear.

Defendant was fined 10s. and costs, or fourteen days' for assaulting the Frenchmen, and the other case was dismissed.

The parish of Rudford has followed the good example set by Tibberton, and the sum of £1 has been subscribed "for the poor Frenchmen who were so shamefully treated in the Forest." A cheque for the amount mentioned has been sent to the French Vice-Consul in Gloucester (Mr. J. B. Karn) by the rector of the parish, the Rev, J. K. Washbourn.
```

In the press, the final mentions of the event record how much was collected in subscriptions in support of the Frenchmen.

The Assault on Frenchmen.— Mr. M. W. Colchester-Wemyss has sent to Mr. James B. Karn, vice-consul for France at Gloucester, a cheque for £34 6s. 2d., being the amount which he has received in response to his appeal for the Frenchmen who received such grievous treatment in the Forest of Dean. Mr. Colchester-Wemyss, in his letter to Mr. Karn, says:—"If you forward the cheque to the Consul-General, perhaps you will send with it the enclosed letter (in French). If, however, you transmit the money direct to the men, will you please assure them, on the part of the subscribers, that the feeling towards them has been one of the heartiest commiseration, and they sincerely hope that the great expression of sympathy which has been evoked may afford them some consolation for the outrage of which they were the innocent victims."
