A watch-word to the city of London, and the armie: wherein you may see that Englands freedome, which should be the result of all our victories, is sinking deeper under the Norman power, as appears by this relation of the unrighteous proceedings of Kingstone-Court against some of the Diggers at George-Hill, under colour of law; but yet thereby the cause of the Diggers is more brightened and strengthened: so that every one singly may truly say what his freedom is, and where it lies / By Jerrard Winstanly.

...

But that all men may see, we are neither ashamed nor afraid,
to justi?e that cause we are arrested for, neither to refuse to
answer to it in a righteous way, therefore we have here delivered this up in writing, and we leave it in your hands, disavowing the proceedings of your Court, because you uphold
Prerogative oppression, though the Kingly office be taken away,
and the Parliament hath declared England a Common-Wealth,0
so that Prerogative Laws cannot be in force, unlesse you be
besotted by your covetousnesse and envy.
We deny that we have trespassed against those three men,
or Mr. Drake either, or that we should trespasse against any, if
we should dig up, or plow for a livelihood, upon any the wast   
Land in England; For thereby we break no particular Law made
by any Act of Parliament, but only an ancient custome, bred in
the strength of Kingly Prerogative, which is that old Law or custome, by which Lords ofMannours lay claime to the Commons,
which is of no force now to bind the people ofEngland, since the
Kingly power and office was cast out: and the common people,
who have cast out the oppressor, by their purse and pelson,
have not authorized any as yet, to give away from them their
purchased freedome; and if any assume a power to give away,
or withhold this purchased freedome, they are Traytors to this
Connnon—Wealth of England: and if they imprison, oppresse, or
put to death any for standing to maintaine the purchased freed-
ome, they are murderers and thieves, and no just rulers.
Therefore in the light of reason and equity, and in the light
of the National] Covenant, which Parliament and people have
taken, with joynt consent: all such Prerogative customes, which
by experience we have found to burden the Nation, ought to be
cast out, with the Kingly office, and the Land of England now
ought to be a free Land, and a common treasury to all her children, otherwise it cannot properly be called a Common—Wealth.
Therefore we justi?e our act of digging upon that hill, to
make the earth a common treasurie. First, because the earth
was made by Almighty God, to be a common treasury of livelihood for whole mankind in all his branches, without respect of
persons; and that not any one according to the Word of God
(which is love) the pure Law of righteousnesse, ought to be
Lord or landlord over another, but whole mankind was made
equal], and knit into one body by one spirit of love, which is
Christ in you the hope of glory, even all the members of mans
body, called the little world, are united into equality of love, to
preserve the whole body.
