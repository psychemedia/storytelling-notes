Beira , goddess of winter / the Cailleach
WIklipedia "n Scotland and Ireland, the first farmer to finish the grain harvest made a corn dolly, representing the Cailleach (also called "the Carlin or Carline"[19]), from the last sheaf of the crop. The figure would then be tossed into the field of a neighbor who had not yet finished bringing in their grain. The last farmer to finish had the responsibility to take in and care for the corn dolly for the next year, with the implication they'd have to feed and house the hag all winter. Competition was fierce to avoid having to take in the Old Woman.[20]"

THE STORY THAT NEVER ENDS
(To be told very seriously)
ONCE upon a time there was a shepherd who had a great flock of sheep. He used to pasture them in a meadow on the other side of a brook. One day the sun had ah-eady set before he started home. Recent rains had swollen the brook so that he and the sheep had to cross on a little footbridge. The bridge was so narrow that the sheep had to pass over one by one.
Now we'll wait until he drives them all over. Then I'll go on with my story.
(When the children grow impatient and beg for a continuation of the story, they are told that there are many sheep and that up to this time only a few have crossed. A little later when their impatience again breaks out, they are told that the sheep are still crossing. And so on indefinitely. In conclusion:)
In fact there were so many sheep that when morning came they were still crossing, and then it was time for the shepherd to turn around and drive them back again to pasture!

??there is a nasruddin or birbal story with a similar sense

Bread peasant http://www.dailytenminutes.com/2012/11/story-woman-and-bread.html

the evil that you do stays with you

(but via Sue) Seems to be a sikh story? popular on web c. 2012

A woman baked chapatti (roti) for members of her family and an extra one for a hungry passerby. She kept the extra chapatti on the window sill, for whosoever would take it away. Every day, a hunchback came and took away the chapatti. Instead of expressing gratitude, he muttered the following words as he went his way: "The evil you do remains with you: The good you do, comes back to you!" This went on, day after day. Every day, the hunchback came, picked up the chapatti and uttered the words: "The evil you do, remains with you: The good you do, comes back to you!" The woman felt irritated. "Not a word of gratitude," she said to herself... 

"Everyday this hunchback utters this jingle! What does he mean?" One day, exasperated, she decided to do away with him. "I shall get rid of this hunchback," she said. And what did she do? She added poison to the chapatti she prepared for him! As she was about to keep it on the window sill, her hands trembled. "What is this I am doing?" she said. Immediately, she threw the chapatti into the fire, prepared another one and kept it on the window sill. As usual, the hunchback came, picked up the chapatti and muttered the words: "The evil you do, remains with you: The good you do, comes back to you!" The hunchback proceeded on his way, blissfully unaware of the war raging in the mind of the woman. 

Every day, as the woman placed the chapatti on the window sill, she offered a prayer for her son who had gone to a distant place to seek his fortune. For many months, she had no news of him.. She prayed for his safe return. That evening, there was a knock on the door. As she opened it, she was surprised to find her son standing in the doorway. He had grown thin and lean. His garments were tattered and torn. He was hungry, starved and weak. As he saw his mother, he said, "Mom, it's a miracle I'm here. While I was but a mile away, I was so famished that I collapsed. I would have died, but just then an old hunchback passed by. I begged of him for a morsel of food, and he was kind enough to give me a whole chapatti. As he gave it to me, he said, "This is what I eat everyday: today, I shall give it to you, for your need is greater than mine!" " As the mother heard those words, her face turned pale. 

She leaned against the door for support. She remembered the poisoned chapatti that she had made that morning. Had she not burnt it in the fire, it would have been eaten by her own son, and he would have lost his life! It was then that she realized the significance of the words:
"The evil you do remains with you: The good you do, comes back to you!" 
Do good and Don't ever stop doing good, even if it is not appreciated at that time. 

If you like this, share it with others and I bet so many lives would be touched

There are many tales in which a lowly peasant girl has a change of fortune and rises from a poor situation to one of much higher standing. As Kurt Vonnegut suggested in his "Shapes of Stories" descriptions of popular tales, this is perhaps "the most popular story in western civilisation"!

Unforeseen Consequences: Travelling the Road

The Athanor

- Stone Soup
- Tinker Lamp
- Wish Ring
  - Sweet seller lamp
- Plains Old People
[Lawyer Devil Candle]

My first story starts, not at the beginning, which is where you might have expected a story to begin, but in the middle of another tale, with two children, a brother and sister, making their way along a path, through the forest. Where they have come from, and where they are going, our story does not say, but we shall travel along with them for a while before they return to their own tale.

Night is starting to fall, and as they make their way trhough the wood, they see and old tinker couple, man and wife, coming towards them.

PROPS:

Red glass lamp, tea light candle bunrning inside. Ideally a slightly taller candle? Also, the lakp was quite warm. Need a stand and hook to bring it to shoulder height?

ISSUES DURING SET:

I didn't learn the close properly; in fumbling, asked if folk wanted another (they didn't) and did it anyway; plus I introduced it as short but many folk might have regarded it as not short. I was an hour at end of natural set so didn't need final story, but it gave me a contrived snuffing out of candle in lamp. Spoke too fast at start; was losing voice at end. Forgot where I was in the Tinker Lamp tale: could this be an audience participation thing?

The verge..

As the bird flies away following an out of body experience, as the self-reassembles, it may not reassemble as it was before. You may haave been a teacher, a doctor, a lover of X, a doubter of Y, but whqt if the pieces reassemble a different you. This is "the verge".

Ring that makes a happy man sad and a sad man happy. "This too shall pass"

Ring of King Solomon eg in http://www.professorsolomon.com/ringofsolomon.html

> King Solomon was sitting on his throne one morning, And he decided that Benaiah, the captain of the Palace Guard, needed a lesson in humility. So the king summoned Benaiah and gave him an impossible mission to fulfill. “I have heard rumors of a fabulous ring,” said Solomon. “It has a unique power. When a sad man gazes upon it, he becomes happy. But when a happy man gazes upon it, he becomes sad. Find this ring and bring it to me.”
>
> Benaiah set out in search of the ring. He traveled from town to town, inquiring as to its whereabouts. But no one had ever heard of such a ring. And he was about to give up when he spotted a junk shop, whose proprietor was sitting out front. Benaiah approached the man and described the object of his search.
>
> “A ring that cheers the sad and saddens the cheerful?” said the junk dealer. “Come inside.”
>
> They entered the shop. From a boxful of baubles the junk dealer took a plain, silver ring. He engraved some words on it and gave it to Benaiah. Benaiah read the inscription, nodded sagely, and headed back to the palace.
>
> Solomon was expecting an unsuccessful—and humbled—Benaiah. So when Benaiah strode in and handed him the ring, the king was taken aback. Inspecting it, he read the inscription—and let out a melancholy sigh.
>
> King Solomon removed his costly rings and slipped on the ring from the junk shop. “It was I who needed a lesson in humility,” he said. “This ring has reminded me that wealth and power are fleeting things.”
>
> For inscribed on the ring was a Yiddish phrase:
>
> GAM ZU YAAVOR (“This too shall pass”)

> "King Solomon once searched for a cure against depression. He assembled his wise men together. They meditated for a long time and gave him the following advice: Make yourself a ring and have thereon engraved the words 'This too will pass.' The King carried out the advice. He had the ring made and wore it constantly. Every time he felt sad and depressed, he looked at the ring, whereon his mood would change and he would feel cheerful"

Claire Murphy  (from Ben Haggerty?)

Alexander the Great on tour again; came to market; everyone bowd down, except one woman, minding her stall. WTF? I'm busy - stalls don't look after themselves you know. Saw something - two eyeballs; I want those - you can't afford them. Scales, eyes on one, gold on other - didn't move  - more gold, bigger scales; they are your yes  -know matter how much gold they see, they always want more.

( Laura Gibbs )

> Diomedes, so the story tells us, was a notorious pirate who had finally been captured and brought before the emperor for sentencing. Because of the pirate's many criminal deeds, everyone expected that Alexander would sentence the pirate to death.  Before he passed judgment, however, Alexander decided to interview the pirate.
> 
> "What could possibly give you the right to sail the seas, taking by force things that do not belong to you?" Alexander asked the pirate.
>
> Diomedes boldly replied with some questions of his own. "O Emperor," he said, "what could possibly give you the right to travel the whole world, taking by force things that do not belong to you? What gave you the right to occupy the land of Egypt? Who made you king of Persia? By what authority did you invade the land of India?
>
> Alexander stared at the man in amazement, and Diomedes went on speaking. "Because I use only my own boat," he said, "I am called a pirate. You, however, use your army and your navy, and so you are proclaimed an emperor. If you ask me who is the greater criminal, I cannot say. I do know, however, that if I had such weapons at my disposal, I would be an emperor too."
>
> Alexander was so impressed by this reply that instead of punishing the pirate, he let him go, praising him for his boldness and insight.
