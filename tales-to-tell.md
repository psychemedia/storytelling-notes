Golden Casket

King wants son to marry; girl will marry who she speaks to else they are killed; Prince says here; market seller -  "This casket for sale ! whoever buys it will rue it ; and again, whoever does not buy it, will rue it : the price is a thou- sand ducats, no more and no less."

Gets to town where Princess lives; Princess father also tired of his daughter; she will die if he fails. Wager is he ust make her speak three times

Casket speaks to him": As soon as you enter, say, * Good evening to you,' and see that you put me down some- where, and afterwards begin to tell as many lies and stories as you can. She, meanwhile, will be sitting aloft by the glass cupboard, she sees you, and you don't see her, and she is as silent as a rock. Then you must say, ' Well, as the Princess doesn't deign to speak to us, won't you speak to us ? ' naming the object on which you have placed me. Then I will begin to talk to you, and you must ask me to tell you a tale, and I shall answer, ' I will, but on your honour, wall you pronounce a right judgment thereon ? ' and you must take good care and pronounce one that is altogether wrong. Then she will be indignant, and will speak."
But since the Lady Princess will not speak with us — will not you, per chance, little shelf, speak a word with us, who are here all alone, and have no one to talk to ? "
"Gladly, master," answers the shelf; "if I would not speak for your sake, do you think I would for the sake of yonder wretch ? "
" Thanks, little shelf ! "
" What will you have ? — a song, a jest, or a little tale ? " "Well, to pass the time, let's say — a tale." " But allow me to say, master, that I shall ask you to deliver a fair judgment thereon ? "

Tale... need a get out to prompt speaking.

Smashes shelf.

Day 2, chair. Smashes chair - "you have never spoken before"

Day 3, dressing table.

the evil that you do stays with you

(but via Sue) Seems to be a sikh story? popular on web c. 2012

A woman baked chapatti (roti) for members of her family and an extra one for a hungry passerby. She kept the extra chapatti on the window sill, for whosoever would take it away. Every day, a hunchback came and took away the chapatti. Instead of expressing gratitude, he muttered the following words as he went his way: "The evil you do remains with you: The good you do, comes back to you!" This went on, day after day. Every day, the hunchback came, picked up the chapatti and uttered the words: "The evil you do, remains with you: The good you do, comes back to you!" The woman felt irritated. "Not a word of gratitude," she said to herself... 

"Everyday this hunchback utters this jingle! What does he mean?" One day, exasperated, she decided to do away with him. "I shall get rid of this hunchback," she said. And what did she do? She added poison to the chapatti she prepared for him! As she was about to keep it on the window sill, her hands trembled. "What is this I am doing?" she said. Immediately, she threw the chapatti into the fire, prepared another one and kept it on the window sill. As usual, the hunchback came, picked up the chapatti and muttered the words: "The evil you do, remains with you: The good you do, comes back to you!" The hunchback proceeded on his way, blissfully unaware of the war raging in the mind of the woman. 

Every day, as the woman placed the chapatti on the window sill, she offered a prayer for her son who had gone to a distant place to seek his fortune. For many months, she had no news of him.. She prayed for his safe return. That evening, there was a knock on the door. As she opened it, she was surprised to find her son standing in the doorway. He had grown thin and lean. His garments were tattered and torn. He was hungry, starved and weak. As he saw his mother, he said, "Mom, it's a miracle I'm here. While I was but a mile away, I was so famished that I collapsed. I would have died, but just then an old hunchback passed by. I begged of him for a morsel of food, and he was kind enough to give me a whole chapatti. As he gave it to me, he said, "This is what I eat everyday: today, I shall give it to you, for your need is greater than mine!" " As the mother heard those words, her face turned pale. 

She leaned against the door for support. She remembered the poisoned chapatti that she had made that morning. Had she not burnt it in the fire, it would have been eaten by her own son, and he would have lost his life! It was then that she realized the significance of the words:
"The evil you do remains with you: The good you do, comes back to you!" 
Do good and Don't ever stop doing good, even if it is not appreciated at that time. 

If you like this, share it with others and I bet so many lives would be touched

Unforeseen Consequences: Travelling the Road

The Athanor

- Stone Soup
- Tinker Lamp
- Wish Ring
  - Sweet seller lamp
- Plains Old People
[Lawyer Devil Candle]

My first story starts, not at the beginning, which is where you might have expected a story to begin, but in the middle of another tale, with two children, a brother and sister, making their way along a path, through the forest. Where they have come from, and where they are going, our story does not say, but we shall travel along with them for a while before they return to their own tale.

Night is starting to fall, and as they make their way trhough the wood, they see and old tinker couple, man and wife, coming towards them.

PROPS:

Red glass lamp, tea light candle bunrning inside. Ideally a slightly taller candle? Also, the lakp was quite warm. Need a stand and hook to bring it to shoulder height?

ISSUES DURING SET:

I didn't learn the close properly; in fumbling, asked if folk wanted another (they didn't) and did it anyway; plus I introduced it as short but many folk might have regarded it as not short. I was an hour at end of natural set so didn't need final stroy, but it gave me a contrived snuffing out of candle in lamp. Spoke too fast at start; was losing voice at end. Forgot where I was in the Tinker Lamp tale: could this be an audience participation thing?
