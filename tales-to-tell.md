Here's a faithful transcription of the newspaper article:

SPIRITS AT LARGE.

SHEFFIELD HOUSE THAT REEKED WITH RUM.

BARREL OUT OF BARREL INN.

STIPENDIARY'S MYSTERIOUS MEN.

A "rum case" occupied the attention of the Sheffield Stipendiary's Court yesterday for several hours. It was saturated with rum. Bottles of rum were on and around the solicitors' table, and the unfortunate people who were concerned in the inquiry had literally been swamped in rum. It moved the advocates to humour. The Stipendiary himself could not resist the temptation, and wild comedy held sway in the staid court of justice.

Two "mysterious men," as the Stipendiary called them, rolled a barrel of rum away from a licensed house, and on their journey to Bailey Lane the barrel sprung a leak, and the first flow began. Rum ran down the the lane. The "mysterious men" persevered, and the barrel found its way into a house. The rum still leaked.

Pans and bottles were utilised. Neighbouring houses were called upon for utensil assistance. Rum filled the pancheons, ran into the bath, and covered the floor, and the place reeked with the smell of it. There was a "local odour"—a very strong smell of rum, as the detective described it—but with all these facts agreed upon, and with all the attention given to the case, no conclusive decision was arrived at, and the case had a rum ending.

Getting the Christmas Fare.

Michael and Bertha Malloy, a labourer and his wife, of 18, Bailey Lane, and Margaret Malloy, single woman, of 14, Bailey Lane, were summoned for stealing a barrel containing 15½ gallons of rum from the passage of the house of Albert Fidler, licensed victualler, of the Barrel Inn, Broad Lane, and for receiving the same knowing it to be stolen.

Mr. P. Blythe Richardson, for the prosecution, stated that the barrel of rum, which was 30 over proof, arrived at the premises, and on Monday night, December 26th, it was in the passage. The barrel was in the Barrel Inn then, but the next afternoon, the barrel was found to be out of the Barrel Inn. (Laughter.)

On the morning of the 26th, various people saw certain persons removing the barrel down the street, and in their hurry to get the Christmas fare home, they broke the barrel and some of the contents were lost, but they managed to get almost the whole of it to the house at No. 18, where they had a convivial gathering.

The secret got out, and on the evening of the 27th, detectives found a lot of rum in the house. To avoid waste through leakage, pans and bottles had been borrowed to hold the escaping liquor.

Michael, said Mr. Richardson, appeared to have found it was rather too strong for his constitution, and he was spending his time on the couch. Other neighbours annexed a considerable quantity, a lot of it was put in the cellar of another house, and eventually information was given to Mr. Fidler.

The police arrested the male defendant and his wife, and proceeded to 14, Bailey Lane, where they found women removing a considerable quantity of the rum, concealed behind their aprons. The value of the barrel, with its contents, was £17 4s. 5d.

Evidence was given to show that two men, neither of whom was the defendant, were seen taking the barrel to 18, Bailey Lane.

Rum, Rum, Rum.

Mrs. Maclaughan landlady of the Royal Oak, Hollis Croft, and wife of the owner of No. 18, Bailey Lane, said Bertha Malloy came to her, and asked her if she could find the owner of the rum, which had come to the house she knew not whither. Witness said the house reeked with rum, it was all over the house, in nearly every receptacle they possessed—even the bath—and all about the floor. It could be smelt as one was passing the door.

Mr. Richardson: You don't suggest they had been bathing in it? (Laughter.)

Witness said she mentioned the matter to Mr. Fidler, who in evidence said some of the bottles of rum produced were 28 over proof. They were temporarily placed in a cellar at Penton Street, at Mr. Fidler's request, after Mrs. Maclaughan had given him the information.

Detective-Officer Burns said he went with Detective-Sergeant Oates and Detective-Officer Plant to make investigations at 18, Bailey Lane. A saucepan and mug were found in the back kitchen, both receptacles containing rum. When Michael Malloy was asked to explain where the rum came from he became excited, and said, "You can't get blood out of a carrot. You will not get to know much from me."

Mr. Richardson asked one witness whether, at a certain time, she was in the Barrel.

"In the barrel?" queried Mr. Wing, in astonishment.

"In the Barrel Inn," explained Mr. Richardson.

Witness went to 14, Bailey Lane, and there found Margaret Malloy in possession of six bottles of rum and one of whisky. Margaret Malloy told him she was in a Christmas club, and had had a pound's worth of rum.

Mr. Richardson asked Burns whether there was any local odour about the kitchen.

Witness: There was a strong smell of rum. (Laughter.)

Mr. J. E. Wing (for the defence): You recognised it?

Witness: Yes.

Mr. Wing submitted that there was no case proved.

The Stipendiary pointed out that evidence of the men who rolled the cask to 18, Bailey Lane, was Michael Malloy, and when the men got it there, there was the usual carousal, he supposed, but whether it was between the two men, or more, did not appear. Some of the rum got into their heads; some of it got on to the floor—(laughter)—some of it got in the pancheons, then into jars and bottles, and now had arrived at the court. (Laughter.) He wanted to know what happened at Malloy's house.

A Common Trick.

Mr. Wing submitted that there was no evidence at all of defendants having stolen the rum. They had not the slightest idea who were the two men who brought the barrel, and the suggestion for the defence was that the men took it up to 18, Bailey Lane, when they began to think the police were on their track. Defendants never saw the barrel until next morning, and they then began to find out how it had come. There was not the slightest attempt at concealment, and Bertha Malloy was particularly anxious to know where it had all come from.

Michael Molloy said his wife had told him the barrel had been brought during his absence.

Bertha Malloy declared that Mr. Fidler knew who had stolen the rum.

Mr. Richardson: Are people in the habit of bringing spare barrels of rum to your house whenever they find them hanging about?

Bertha Malloy said she knew nothing about it. She had no key to her house.

At Mr. Wing's request, Mr. Fidler was recalled, and he was asked if he did know who stole the barrel.

He said the police had told him who stole it.

Mr. Wing: Did you say in your house, "I have got hold of the wrong people, because I know, as a fact, who has stolen it?" Witness: No.

The Stipendiary said he wished some light could be thrown on the two mysterious men. It was a common trick for defendants to know nothing, and in order to give them an opportunity of bestirring themselves, he adjourned the case until next Tuesday.

Sheffield Independent - Friday 20 January 1911

THE RUM CASE. ANOTHER SHEFFIELD MAN CHARGED WITH THE THEFT.

What Mr. P. B. Richardson described as "a resuscitation of the rum case" came before the Sheffield Stipendiary (Mr. E. M. E. Welby) yesterday. A few days ago two men and a woman were acquitted of a charge of stealing a barrel of rum from the Barrel Inn, Broad lane. Mr. Richardson said that when that case was heard it was not suggested that the parties then in custody had actually rolled the barrel from the Barrel Inn to a certain house in Bailey lane; but a warrant was issued for the arrest of two men who were said to have actually stolen the barrel.

On that warrant a bookmaker's clerk named Samuel Gorvin (25), of 61, Alfred road, Sheffield, was yesterday placed in the dock on the theft charge. He was remanded on bail until Monday next. Detective-sergeant Oates had arrested the prisoner.

Beira , goddess of winter / the Cailleach
Wikipedia "n Scotland and Ireland, the first farmer to finish the grain harvest made a corn dolly, representing the Cailleach (also called "the Carlin or Carline"[19]), from the last sheaf of the crop. The figure would then be tossed into the field of a neighbor who had not yet finished bringing in their grain. The last farmer to finish had the responsibility to take in and care for the corn dolly for the next year, with the implication they'd have to feed and house the hag all winter. Competition was fierce to avoid having to take in the Old Woman.[20]"

THE STORY THAT NEVER ENDS
(To be told very seriously)
ONCE upon a time there was a shepherd who had a great flock of sheep. He used to pasture them in a meadow on the other side of a brook. One day the sun had ah-eady set before he started home. Recent rains had swollen the brook so that he and the sheep had to cross on a little footbridge. The bridge was so narrow that the sheep had to pass over one by one.
Now we'll wait until he drives them all over. Then I'll go on with my story.
(When the children grow impatient and beg for a continuation of the story, they are told that there are many sheep and that up to this time only a few have crossed. A little later when their impatience again breaks out, they are told that the sheep are still crossing. And so on indefinitely. In conclusion:)
In fact there were so many sheep that when morning came they were still crossing, and then it was time for the shepherd to turn around and drive them back again to pasture!

Bread peasant http://www.dailytenminutes.com/2012/11/story-woman-and-bread.html

the evil that you do stays with you

(but via Sue) Seems to be a sikh story? popular on web c. 2012

A woman baked chapatti (roti) for members of her family and an extra one for a hungry passerby. She kept the extra chapatti on the window sill, for whosoever would take it away. Every day, a hunchback came and took away the chapatti. Instead of expressing gratitude, he muttered the following words as he went his way: "The evil that you do remains with you: The good that you do, comes back to you!" This went on, day after day. Every day, the hunchback came, picked up the chapatti and uttered the words: "The evil you do, remains with you: The good you do, comes back to you!" The woman felt irritated. "Not a word of gratitude," she said to herself... 

"Everyday this hunchback utters this jingle! What does he mean?" One day, exasperated, she decided to do away with him. "I shall get rid of this hunchback," she said. And what did she do? She added poison to the chapatti she prepared for him! As she was about to keep it on the window sill, her hands trembled. "What is this I am doing?" she said. Immediately, she threw the chapatti into the fire, prepared another one and kept it on the window sill. As usual, the hunchback came, picked up the chapatti and muttered the words: "The evil you do, remains with you: The good you do, comes back to you!" The hunchback proceeded on his way, blissfully unaware of the war raging in the mind of the woman.

Every day, as the woman placed the chapatti on the window sill, she offered a prayer for her son who had gone to a distant place to seek his fortune. For many months, she had no news of him. She prayed for his safe return. That evening, there was a knock on the door. As she opened it, she was surprised to find her son standing in the doorway. He had grown thin and lean. His garments were tattered and torn. He was hungry, starved and weak. As he saw his mother, he said, "Mom, it's a miracle I'm here. While I was but a mile away, I was so famished that I collapsed. I would have died, but just then an old hunchback passed by. I begged of him for a morsel of food, and he was kind enough to give me a whole chapatti. As he gave it to me, he said, "This is what I eat everyday: today, I shall give it to you, for your need is greater than mine!" As the mother heard those words, her face turned pale.

She leaned against the door for support. She remembered the poisoned chapatti that she had made that morning. Had she not burnt it in the fire, it would have been eaten by her own son, and he would have lost his life! It was then that she realized the significance of the words:

"The evil you do remains with you: The good you do, comes back to you!"

Do good and Don't ever stop doing good, even if it is not appreciated at that time.

If you like this, share it with others and I bet so many lives would be touched

There are many tales in which a lowly peasant girl has a change of fortune and rises from a poor situation to one of much higher standing. As Kurt Vonnegut suggested in his "Shapes of Stories" descriptions of popular tales, this is perhaps "the most popular story in western civilisation"!

Unforeseen Consequences: Travelling the Road

The Athanor

- Stone Soup
- Tinker Lamp
- Wish Ring
  - Sweet seller lamp
- Plains Old People
[Lawyer Devil Candle]

My first story starts, not at the beginning, which is where you might have expected a story to begin, but in the middle of another tale, with two children, a brother and sister, making their way along a path, through the forest. Where they have come from, and where they are going, our story does not say, but we shall travel along with them for a while before they return to their own tale.

Night is starting to fall, and as they make their way trhough the wood, they see and old tinker couple, man and wife, coming towards them.

PROPS:

Red glass lamp, tea light candle bunrning inside. Ideally a slightly taller candle? Also, the lakp was quite warm. Need a stand and hook to bring it to shoulder height?

ISSUES DURING SET:

I didn't learn the close properly; in fumbling, asked if folk wanted another (they didn't) and did it anyway; plus I introduced it as short but many folk might have regarded it as not short. I was an hour at end of natural set so didn't need final story, but it gave me a contrived snuffing out of candle in lamp. Spoke too fast at start; was losing voice at end. Forgot where I was in the Tinker Lamp tale: could this be an audience participation thing?

The verge..

As the bird flies away following an out of body experience, as the self-reassembles, it may not reassemble as it was before. You may haave been a teacher, a doctor, a lover of X, a doubter of Y, but whqt if the pieces reassemble a different you. This is "the verge".

Ring that makes a happy man sad and a sad man happy. "This too shall pass"

Ring of King Solomon eg in http://www.professorsolomon.com/ringofsolomon.html

> King Solomon was sitting on his throne one morning, And he decided that Benaiah, the captain of the Palace Guard, needed a lesson in humility. So the king summoned Benaiah and gave him an impossible mission to fulfill. "I have heard rumors of a fabulous ring," said Solomon. "It has a unique power. When a sad man gazes upon it, he becomes happy. But when a happy man gazes upon it, he becomes sad. Find this ring and bring it to me."
>
> Benaiah set out in search of the ring. He traveled from town to town, inquiring as to its whereabouts. But no one had ever heard of such a ring. And he was about to give up when he spotted a junk shop, whose proprietor was sitting out front. Benaiah approached the man and described the object of his search.
>
> "A ring that cheers the sad and saddens the cheerful?" said the junk dealer. "Come inside."
>
> They entered the shop. From a boxful of baubles the junk dealer took a plain, silver ring. He engraved some words on it and gave it to Benaiah. Benaiah read the inscription, nodded sagely, and headed back to the palace.
>
> Solomon was expecting an unsuccessful—and humbled—Benaiah. So when Benaiah strode in and handed him the ring, the king was taken aback. Inspecting it, he read the inscription—and let out a melancholy sigh.
>
> King Solomon removed his costly rings and slipped on the ring from the junk shop. "It was I who needed a lesson in humility," he said. "This ring has reminded me that wealth and power are fleeting things."
>
> For inscribed on the ring was a Yiddish phrase:
>
> GAM ZU YAAVOR ("This too shall pass")

> "King Solomon once searched for a cure against depression. He assembled his wise men together. They meditated for a long time and gave him the following advice: Make yourself a ring and have thereon engraved the words 'This too will pass.' The King carried out the advice. He had the ring made and wore it constantly. Every time he felt sad and depressed, he looked at the ring, whereon his mood would change and he would feel cheerful"

Claire Murphy  (from Ben Haggerty?)

Alexander the Great on tour again; came to market; everyone bowd down, except one woman, minding her stall. WTF? I'm busy - stalls don't look after themselves you know. Saw something - two eyeballs; I want those - you can't afford them. Scales, eyes on one, gold on other - didn't move  - more gold, bigger scales; they are your yes  -know matter how much gold they see, they always want more.

( Laura Gibbs )

> Diomedes, so the story tells us, was a notorious pirate who had finally been captured and brought before the emperor for sentencing. Because of the pirate's many criminal deeds, everyone expected that Alexander would sentence the pirate to death.  Before he passed judgment, however, Alexander decided to interview the pirate.
>
> "What could possibly give you the right to sail the seas, taking by force things that do not belong to you?" Alexander asked the pirate.
>
> Diomedes boldly replied with some questions of his own. "O Emperor," he said, "what could possibly give you the right to travel the whole world, taking by force things that do not belong to you? What gave you the right to occupy the land of Egypt? Who made you king of Persia? By what authority did you invade the land of India?
>
> Alexander stared at the man in amazement, and Diomedes went on speaking. "Because I use only my own boat," he said, "I am called a pirate. You, however, use your army and your navy, and so you are proclaimed an emperor. If you ask me who is the greater criminal, I cannot say. I do know, however, that if I had such weapons at my disposal, I would be an emperor too."
>
> Alexander was so impressed by this reply that instead of punishing the pirate, he let him go, praising him for his boldness and insight.
