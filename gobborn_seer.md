# Gobborn Seer / Goban Saor

A few years ago, I picked up, via two separate purchases, the four volumes of Katharine Briggs' *Dictionary of British Folk-Tales*. Most of the time, it sits on the bookshelf *just in case*, but skimming through it a day or two ago whilst looking up a reference to the *Hedley Kow*, which it turns out I had already previously bookmarked, I was reminded of the *Gobborn Seer*. This is (was, now) not a story I actually knew, though: (a) I had recently come across a couple of references to it whilst digging into *Wayland Smith*; and (b) (I think) it was an echo of a mention Daniel Mordern made to whilst chatting last year and that I had noted as a story I didn't know, but from the context of the conversation was one I probably should (as were the general sense of who the lady folklorists and story collectors were (Mrs. Bray, Mrs. Balfour, Miss Burne, Mrs. Gomme, Ella Mary Leather, Ruth Tongue, Lady Charlotte Guest, Lady Wilde, Lady Gregory, &c.) and which tales they had collected).

The version of the tale given in Briggs (*Part A, Volume 1, II, pp.277-9*) is taken from Jacobs' *More English Fairy Tales*. Briggs' note is an extended form of Jacobs' note on the story, although it appears to contain an error:

> Collected by Mrs. Gomme from an old woman at Deptford, "Gobborn Seer" comes from the Irish "Goban Saor", a travelling carpenter, a godlike character somewhat in the tradition of Wayland Smith. The tale is to be found in Ireland. "The Peasant's Wise Daughter", to which this tale bears some resemblance, occurs in Kennedy's *Fireside Stories*. A wise wife, who compensates for her husband's lack of intelligence, is to be found in "A Pottle of Brains".

This seems not to be correct? "The Peasant's Wise Daughter" is in Grimm; "The Goban Saor" appears in Kennedy's *Legendary Fictions of the Irish Celts*, and there is a parallel tale to "A Pottle of Brains" in Kennedy's *Fireside Stories* ("A Legend of Clever Women").

*See also my separate storynote on "A Pottle of Brains".*

Pronunciation seems to vary depending which part of Ireland the speaker comes from. *gubbawn sair* works for me, although I have heard other versions, including *gob-an sair*, *gubban sair* and *gubawn seer*.

Note also various spellings: *Goban Saor* (Patrick Kennedy, *Legendary fictions of the Irish Celts*), *Gobhaun Saor* (Ella Young, *Celtic wonder-tales*, 1910), *Gobaun Saor* (Padraic Colum, *My Irish year*, 1912).

LIV. Gobborn Seer

ONCE there was a man Gobborn Seer, and he had a son called Jack. One day he sent him out to sell a sheepskin, and Gobborn said, "You must bring me back the skin and the value of it as well."

So Jack started, but he could not find any who would leave him the skin and give him its price too. So he came home discouraged.

But Gobborn Seer said, "Never mind, you must take another turn at it to-morrow."

So he tried again, and nobody wished to buy the skin on those terms.

When he came home his father said, "You must go and try your luck to-morrow," and the third day it seemed as if it would be the same thing over again. And he had half a mind not to go back at all, his father would be so vexed. As he came to a bridge, like the Creek Road one yonder, he leaned on the parapet thinking of his trouble, and that perhaps it would be foolish to run away from home, but he could not tell which to do; when he saw a girl washing her clothes on the bank below. She looked up and said:

"If it may be no offence asking, what is it you feel so badly about?"

"My father has given me this skin, and I am to fetch it back and the price of it beside."

"Is that all? Give it here, and it's easy done."

So the girl washed the skin in the stream, took the wool from it, and paid him the value of it, and gave him the skin to carry back.

His father was well pleased, and said to Jack, "That was a witty woman; she would make you a good wife. Do you think you could tell her again?"

Jack thought he could, so his father told him to go by-and-by to the bridge, and see if she was there, and if so bid her come home to take tea with them.

And sure enough Jack spied her and told her how his old father had a wish to meet her, and would she be pleased to drink tea with them.

The girl thanked him kindly, and said she could come the next day; she was too busy at the moment.

"All the better," said Jack, "I'll have time to make ready."

So when she came Gobborn Seer could see she was a witty woman, and he asked her if she would marry his Jack. She said "Yes," and they were married.

Not long after, Jack's father told him he must come with him and build the finest castle that ever was seen, for a king who wished to outdo all others by his wonderful castle.

And as they went to lay the foundation-stone, Gobborn Seer said to Jack, "Can't you shorten the way for me?"

But Jack looked ahead and there was a long road before them, and he said, "I don't see, father, how I could break a bit off."

"You're no good to me, then, and had best be off home."

So poor Jack turned back, and when he came in his wife said, "Why, how's this you've come alone?" and he told her what his father had said and his answer.

"You stupid," said his witty wife, "if you had told a tale you would have shortened the road! Now listen till I tell you a story, and then catch up with Gobborn Seer and begin it at once. He will like hearing it, and by the time you are done you will have reached the foundation-stone."

So Jack sweated and overtook his father. Gobborn Seer said never a word, but Jack began his story, and the road was shortened as his wife had said.

When they came to the end of their journey, they started building of this castle which was to outshine all others. Now the wife had advised them to be intimate with the servants, and so they did as she said, and it was "Good-morning" and "Good-day to you" as they passed in and out.

Now, at the end of a twelvemonth, Gobborn, the wise man, had built such a castle thousands were gathered to admire it.

And the king said: "The castle is done. I shall return to-morrow and pay you all."

"I have just a ceiling to finish in an upper lobby," said Gobborn, "and then it wants nothing."

But after the king was gone off, the housekeeper sent for Gobborn and Jack, and told them that she had watched for a chance to warn them, for the king was so afraid they should carry their art away and build some other king as fine a castle, he meant to take their lives on the morrow. Gobborn told Jack to keep a good heart, and they would come off all right.

When the king had come back Gobborn told him he had been unable to complete the job for lack of a tool left at home, and he should like to send Jack after it.

"No, no," said the king, "cannot one of the men do the errand?"

"No, they could not make themselves understood," said the Seer, "but Jack could do the errand."

"You and your son are to stop here. But how will it do if I send my own son?"

"That will do."

So Gobborn sent by him a message to Jack's wife. "Give him *Crooked and Straight*."

Now there was a little hole in the wall rather high up, and Jack's wife tried to reach up into a chest there after "crooked and straight," but at last she asked the king's son to help her, because his arms were longest.

But when he was leaning over the chest she caught him by the two heels, and threw him into the chest, and fastened it down. So there he was, both "crooked and straight!"

Then he begged for pen and ink, which she brought him, but he was not allowed out, and holes were bored that he might breathe.

When his letter came, telling the king, his father, he was to be let free when Gobborn and Jack were safe home, the king saw he must settle for the building, and let them come away.

As they left Gobborn told him: Now that Jack was done with this work, he should soon build a castle for his witty wife far superior to the king's, which he did, and they lived there happily ever after.

LIV. GOBBORN SEER

Source. — Collected by Mrs. Gomme from an old woman at Deptford. It is to be remarked that "Gobborn Seer" is Irish (Goban Saor = free carpenter), and is the Irish equivalent of Wayland Smith, and occurs in several place names in Ireland.

Parallels. — The essence of the tale occurs in Kennedy, *l. c.* [*Legendary fictions of the Irish Celts*, 1866] p. 67, *seq.* Gobborn Seer's daughter was clearly the clever lass who is found in all parts of the Indo-European world. An instance in my Indian Fairy Tales, "Why the Fish Laughed" (No. xxiv.). She has been made a special study by Prof. Child, *English and Scotch Ballads*, i., 485, while an elaborate monograph by Prof. Benfey under the title "Die Kluge Dime" (reprinted in his *Kleine Schriften*, ii., 156, seq.), formed the occasion for his first presentation of his now well-known hypothesis of the derivation of all folk-tales from India.

Remarks. — But for the accident of the title being preserved there would have been nothing to show that this tale had been imported into England from Ireland, whither it had probably been carried all the way from India.

In the older, Irish versions, more is often made of the fact that the Goban Sair was an all round master craftsman ("the master of sixteen trades"): carpenter, stone mason, blacksmith, and more. He is also something of a trickster character, with a daughter-in-law who has wits to match to compensate for his only son's apparent lack of intelligence.

THE GOBAN SAOR.

It is a long time since the Goban Saor was alive. Maybe it was *him* that built the Castle of Ferns; part of the walls are thick enough to be built by any goban, or gow, that ever splintered wood, or hammered red-hot iron, or cut a stone. If he didn't build Ferns, he built other castles for some of the five kings or the great chiefs. He could fashion a spear-shaft while you'd count five, and the spear-head at three strokes of a hammer. When he wanted to drive big nails into beams that were ever so high from the ground, he would pitch them into their place, and, taking a fling of the hammer at their heads, they would be drove in as firm as the Jcnocker of Newgate, and he would catch the hammer when it was falhng down.

At last it came to the King of Munster's turn to get his castle built, and to Goban he sent. Goban knew that, in other times far back, the King of Ireland killed the celebrated architects, Rog, Robog, Rodin, and Rooney, the way they would never build another palace equal to his, and so he mentioned something to his wife privately before he set out. He took his son along with him, and the first night they got lodging at a farmer's house. The farmer told them they might leave their beasts to graze all night in any of his fields they pleased. So they entered one field, and says Goban, "Tie the bastes up for the night" "Why?" says the son; "I can't find anything strong enough." "Well, then, let us try the next field. Now," says he, "tie up the horses if you can." "Oh! by my word, here's a thistle strong enough this time." "That will do."

The next night they slept at another farmer's house, where there were two young daughters — one with black hair, very industrious; the other with fair complexion, and rather liking to sit with her hands across, and listen to the talk round the fire, than to be doing any work. While they were chatting about one thing and another, says the Goban, "Young girls, if I'd wish to be young again, it would be for the sake of getting one of you for a wife; but I think very few old people that do be thinking at all of the other world, ever wish to live their lives over again. Still I wish that you may have good luck in your choice of a husband, and so I give you three bits of advice. Always have the head of an old woman by the hob; warm yourselves with your work in the morning; and, some time before I come back, take the skin of a newly-killed sheep to the market, and bring itself and the price of it home again." When they were leaving next morning, the Goban said to his son, "Maybe one of these girls may be your wife some day."

As they were going along, they met a poor man striving to put a flat roof over a mud-walled round cabin, but he had only three joists, and each of them was only three-quarters of the breadth across. Well, the Goban put two nicks near one end of every joist, on opposite sides; and when these were fitted into one another, there was a three-cornered figure formed in the middle, and the other ends rested on the mud wall, and the floor they made was as strong as anything. The poor man blessed the two men, and they went on. That night they stopped at a house where the master sat by the fire, and hardly opened his mouth all the evening. If he didn't talk, a meddlesome neighbour did, and interfered about everything. There was another chance lodger besides the Goban and his son, and when the evening was half over, the Goban said he thought he would go farther on his journey as it was a fine night. "You may come along with us, if you like," says he to the other man; but he said he was too tired. The two men slept in a farmer's house half a mile farther on; and the next morning the first news they heard, when they were setting out, was, that the man of the house they left the evening before was found murdered in his bed, and the lodger taken up on suspicion. Says he to his son, "Never sleep a night where the woman is everything, and the man nothing." He stopped a day or two, however, and by cross-examining and calling witnesses, he got the murder tracked to the woman and the busy neighbour.

The next day they came to a ford, where a dozen of carpenters were puzzling their heads about setting up a wooden bridge that would neither have a peg nor a nail in any part of it. The king would give a great reward to them if they succeeded, and if they didn't, he'd never give one of them a job again. "Give us a hatchet and a few sticks," says the Goban, "and we'll see if we have any little genius that way." So he squared a few posts and cross-bars, and made a little bridge on the sod; and it was so made, that the greater weight was on it, and the stronger the stream of water, the solider it would be. `[If a curious reader wishes to know the secret of the roofing of the round cabin, let him get three twigs, cut a notch within half an inch of one end of each, and another about an inch and half from that, but on the opposite side. Let him get a hat, or a large mug, or anything else he pleases, and by adapting the notched ends to each other, he will find the plan of making a roof-support to his model cabin after some essays, more or less, and some healthy trials of his patience. The editor of these sketches will not attempt to decide whether the Goban or Julius Caesar was the inventor of the peg-less and nail-less bridge, but the mode of construction may be learned from the Commentaries on the Gallic War. [TH: the reference here is to Caesar's bridge for crossing the Rhine in AD 55, described in Commentaries on the Gallic War, Volume IV. This bridge can be a long span built from one bank, and is more stable with stronger current. In the story, I think the more likely solution is the construction of a da Vinci (self-supporting) bridge, which can be made from notched sticks and whose stability increases with increasing load.]]`

Maybe the carpenters wam't thankful, except one envious, little, ould basthard of a fellow, that said any child might have thought of the plan (it happened he didn't think of it though), and would make the Goban and his son drink a cag of whisky, only they couldn't delay their journey.

At last they came to where the King of Munster kep' his coort, either at Cashel or Limerick, or some place in Clare, and the Goban burned very little daylight till he had a palace springing up like a flagger. People came from all parts, and were in admiration of the fine work; but as they were getting near the eaves, one of the carpenters that were engaged at the wooden bridge came late one night into the Goban's room, and told him what himself was suspecting, that just as he would be setting the coping stone, the scaffolding would, somehow or other, get loose, himself fall down a few stories and be kilt, the king wring his hands, and shed a few crocodile tears, and the like palace never be seen within the four seas of Ireland.

"Sha gu dheine" `["That's it," or "Is that it?"]` says the Goban to himself j but next day he spoke out plain enough to the king. "Please your Majesty," says he, "I am now pretty near the end of my work, but there is still something to be done before we come to the wall-plate that is to make all sure and strong. There is a bit of a charm about it, but I haven't the tool here — it is at home, and my son got so sick last night, and is lying so bad, he is not able to go for it. If you can't spare the young prince, I must go myself, for my wife wouldn't intrust it to any one but of royal blood." The king, rather than let the Goban out of his sight, sent the young prince for the tool. The Goban told him some outlandish name in Irish, which his wife would find at his bed's head, and bid him make all the haste he could back.

In a week's time, back came two of the poor attendants that were with the prince, and told the king that his son was well off, with the best of eating and drinking, and chess-playing and sword exercise, that any prince could wish for, but that out of her sight the Goban's wife nor her people would let him, till she had her husband safe and sound inside of his own threshold.

Well, to be sure, how the king fumed and raged! But what's the use of striving to tear down a stone wall with your teeth? He could do without his palace being finished, but he couldn't do without his son and heir. The Goban didn't keep spite; he put the finishing touch to the palace in three days, and, in two days more, himself and his son were sitting at the farmer's fireside where the two purty young girls won

"Well, my colleen bawn," says he to the one with the fair hair, "did you mind the advice I gev you when I was here last?" "Indeed I did, and little good it did me. I got an old woman's skull from the churchyard, and fixed it in the wall near the hob, and it so frightened every one, that I was obliged to have it taken back in an hour." "And how did you warm yourself with your work in the cold mornings?" "The first morning's work I had was to card flax, and I thrune some of it on the fire, and my mother gave me such a raking for it, that I didn't offer to warm myself that way again." "Now for the sheep-skin." "That was the worst of all. When I told the buyers in the market that I was to bring back the skin and the price of it, they only jeered at me. One young buckeen said, if I'd go into the tavern and take share of a quart of mulled beer with him, he'd make that bargain with me, and that so vexed me that I turned home at once." "Well, that was the right thing to do, anyhow. Now my little *Ceann Dhu* (black head), let us see how you fared. The skull?" "Och!" says an old woman, sitting close to the fire in the far comer, "I'm a distant relation that was left desolate, and this," says she, tapping the side of her poor head, "is the old woman's skull she provided." "Well, now for the warming of yourself in the cold mornings." "Oh, I kept my hands and feet going so lively at my work that it was warming enough." "Well, and the sheep-skin?" "That was easy enough. When I got to the market, I went to the crane, plucked the wool off, sold it, and brought home the skin."

"Man and woman of the house," says the Goban, "I ask you before this company, to give me this girl for my daughter-in-law; and if ever her husband looks crooked at her, I'll beat him within an inch of his life." There was very few words, and no need of a black man to make up the match; and when the. prince was returning home, he stopped a day to be at the wedding. If I hear of any more of the Goban's great doings, I'll tell 'em some other time.

The heroic tales that are gathered round Finn and Cuchulain have been forgotten by the people of this place. Finn's name is remembered, but the hero has become a big eater and an extravagant liar. The other day I heard a story about the Gobaun Saor. He is out of the very oldest cycle of stories, for he was the Smith and Builder for the gods. In every part of the country stories are current concerning the Gobaun Saor and his son. They generally relate the stratagem by which the elder procured a wise wife for the simple-minded young man. Some of these tales are finely told in a book composed by a real Shanachie — Miss Ella Young's "Celtic Wonder Tales." "Do you know how the Gobaun Saor got a wife for his son?" said I to a story-teller. "I do," said he. Thereupon he told me an anecdote not given in Miss Young's book. "There were three women amongst the neighbours that might suit the son, and the old Gobaun brought the three of them into his house. He put the whole of his treasure into a chest and he let the women open it. "You'd be a long time spending all that's there," said the first woman. "With all that under your hand you'd have an easy time," said the second woman. "Well," said the third woman, "as much as there's in it, if you didn't keep adding to it, it would soon go." The Gobaun Saor took that woman by the hand and brought her to sit down by the fire, and it was to her that he married his son.

HOW THE SON OF THE GOBHAUN SAOR SOLD THE SHEEPSKIN

THE GOBHAUN SAOR was a great person in the old days, and he looked to his son to be a credit to him. He had only one son, and thought the world and all of him, but that was nothing to what the son thought of himself. He was growing up every day, and the more he grew up the more he thought of himself, till at last the Gobhaun Saor's house was too small to hold him, and the Gobhaun said it was time for him to go out and seek his fortune. He gave him a sheepskin and his blessing, and said:

"Take this sheepskin and go into the fair and let me see what cleverness you have in selling it."

"I'll do that," said the son, "and bring you the best price to be got in the fair."

"That's little," said the Gobhaun Saor, "but if you were to bring me the skin and the price of it, I'd say you had cleverness."

"Then that's what I'll bring you!" said the son, and he set off on his travels.

"What do you want for that sheepskin you have?" said the first man he met in the fair. He named his price.

"'Tis a good price," said the man, "but the skin is good, and I have no time for bargaining; here is the money; give me the skin."

"I can't agree to that," said the son of the Gobhaun Saor. "I must have the skin and the price of it too."

"I hope you may get it!" said the man, and he went away laughing. That was the way with all the men that tried to buy the skin, and at last the son of the Gobhaun Saor was tired of trying to sell it, and when he saw a crowd of people standing around a beggar man he went and stood with the rest. The beggar man was doing tricks and every one was watching him. After a while he called out :

"Lend me that sheepskin of yours and I'll show you a trick with it!"

"You needn't ask for the loan of that skin," said one of the men standing by, "for the owner of it wants to keep it and sell it at the same time, there's so much cleverness in him!"

The son of the Gobhaun Saor was angry when that was said, and he flung down the skin to the juggler-man.

"Do a trick with it if you can," said he.

The beggar man spread out the skin and blew between the wool of it, and a great wood sprang up — miles and miles of a dark wood — and there were trees in it with golden apples. The people were frightened when they saw it, but the beggar man walked into the wood till the trees hid him. There was sorrow on the son of the Gobhaun Saor at that.

"Now I'll never give my father either the skin or the price of it," he said to himself, "but the least I may do is to take him an apple off the trees." He put out his hand to an apple, and when he touched it he had only a bit of wool in his hand. The sheepskin was before him. He took it up and went out of the fair.

He was walking along the roads then and it was growing dark and he was feeling sorry for himself, when he saw the light of a house. He went toward it, and when he came to it the door was open, and in the little room inside he saw the beggar man of the fair and another man stirring a big pot.

"Come in," said the beggar man; "this is the house of the Dagda Mor, the World Builder. It isn't much, as you see, but you may rest here and welcome, and maybe the Dagda will give us supper."

"Son Angus," said the Dagda to the beggar man, "you talk as if I had the Cauldron of Plenty, and you know well that it is gone from me. The Fomorians have it now and I have only this pot. Hard enough it is to fill it, and when it is filled I never get a good meal out of it, for a great, hulking, splay-footed churl of a Fomorian comes in when he smells the meat and takes all the best of it from me, and I have only what remains when he has gorged himself; so I am always hungry, son Angus."

"Your case is hard," said Angus, "but I know how you can help yourself."

"Tell me how," said the Dagda.

"Well," said Angus, "get a piece of gold and put it into the best part of the meat, and when the Fomorian has eaten it up tell him he has swallowed the gold; his heart will burst when he hears that, and you'll be rid of him."

"Your plan is good," said the Dagda, "but where am I to get the gold? The Fomorians keep me building all day for them, but they give me nothing."

"I wish I had a piece of gold to give you myself," said Angus. "'Tis a bad thing to be a beggar man! The next time I disguise myself I'll be a prince." He laughed at that, but the Dagda stirred the pot and looked gloomy. The son of the Gobhaun Saor felt sorry for him and remembered that he had a gold ring his father had given him. He pulled it off his finger and gave it to the Dagda.

"Here," said he, "is a piece of gold and you can be rid of the Fomorian."

The Dagda thanked him and gave him his blessing and they spent the night in peace and happiness till morning reddened the sky.

When the son of the Gobhaun Saor started to go, Angus set him a bit on the way.

"You are free-handed," he said to him, "and a credit to your father, and now I'll give you a bit of advice — Say 'Good morrow kindly' to the first woman you can meet on the road, and good luck be with you."

It wasn't long till the son of the Gobhaun Saor saw a woman at a little stream washing clothes. "Good luck to the work," he said, "and good morrow kindly."

"Good morrow to yourself," said she, "and may your load be light."

"It would need to be light," said he, "for I'll have far enough to carry it."

"Why so?" said she.

"I must carry it till I meet some one to give me the price of it and the skin as well."

"You need travel no further for that," said she; "give me the sheepskin."

"With a heart and a half," said he, and he gave her the skin. She paid the price, and she plucked the wool from the skin and threw him the skin.

"Now you can go home to your father," she said.

He wasn't long going, and he was proud when he gave the Gobhaun the skin and the price of it.

"What man showed you the wise way out of it?" said the Gobhaun Saor.

"No man at all," said the son, "but a woman."
 
"And you met a woman like that, and hadn't the wit to bring her with you!" said the Gobhaun Saor. "Away with you now, and don't let the wind that is behind you come up with you till you ask her to marry you!"

HOW THE SON OF THE GOBHAUN SAOR SHORTENED

One day the Son of the Gobhaun Saor was sitting outside in the sunshine, cutting a little reed into a pipe to make music with. He was so busy that he never saw three stranger-men coming till they were close to him. He looked up then and saw three thrawn-faced churls wrapped in long cloaks. "Good morrow to you," said the Son of the Gobhaun Saor. "Good morrow," said they. "We have come to say a word to the Son of the Gobhaun Saor." "He is before you," said the Son. "We have come," said the most thrawn-faced of the three, "from the King of the Land Under Wave to ask you to help him; he has a piece of work that none of his own people can do, and you have the cleverness of the Three Worlds in your fingers." "'Tis my father has that," said the Son of the Gobhaun Saor. "Well," said the other, "bring your father with you to the Land Under Wave and your fortune's made." The Son of the Gobhaun Saor set off at that to find his father. "I have the news of the world for you and your share of fortune out of it," he said. "What news?" said the Gobhaun. "The King of the Land Under Wave has sent for me; if you come with me your fortune is made." "Did he send you a token?" "No token at all, but do you think I would not know his messengers?" "O, 'tis you has the cleverness!" said the Gobhaun Saor.

They set out next morning, and as they were going along, the Gobhaun Saor said: "Son, shorten the way for me." "How could I do that?" said the Son, "if your own two feet can't shorten it." "Now, do you think," said the father, "that you'll make my fortune and your own too when you can't do a little thing like that!" and he went back to the house.

The Son sat down on a stone with his head on his hands to think how he could shorten the road, but the more he thought of it the harder it seemed, and after a while he gave up thinking and began to look round him. He saw a wide stretch of green grass and an old man spreading out locks of wool on it. The old man was frail and bent, and he moved slowly spreading out the wool. The Son of the Gobhaun Saor thought it hard to see the old man working, and went to help him, but when he came nearer a little wind caught the wool and it lifted and drifted, and he saw it wasn't wool at all but white foam of the sea. The old man straightened himself, and the Son of the Gobhaun Saor knew it was Mananaun the Sea-God, and he stood with his eyes on the sea-foam and had nothing to say. "You came to help me," said Mananaun. "I did," said the Son of the Gobhaun Saor, "but you need no help from me." "The outstretched hand," said Mananaun, "is the hand that is filled the fullest; stoop now and take a lock of my wool, it will help you when you need help." The Son of the Gobhaun Saor stooped to the sea-foam; the wind was blowing it, and under the foam he saw the blue of the sea clear as crystal, and under that a field of red flowers bending with the wind. He took a handful of foam. It became a lock of wool, and when he raised himself Mananaun was gone, and there was nothing before him but the greenness of grass and the sun shining on it.

He went home then and showed the lock of wool to his wife and told her the sorrow he was in because he couldn't shorten the road for his father. "Don't be in sorrow for that," said she, "sure every one knows that storytelling is the way to shorten a road." "May wisdom grow with you like the tree that has the nuts of knowledge!" said he. "I'll take your advice, and maybe to-morrow my father won't turn back on the road."

They set out next day and the Gobhaun Saor said — "Son, be shortening the road." At that the Son began the story of Angus Oge and how he won a house for himself from the Dagda Mor: it was a long story, and he made it last till they came to the White Strand

When they got there they saw a clumsy ill-made boat waiting for them, with ugly dark-looking men to row it.

"Since when," said the Gobhaun Saor, "did the King of the Land Under Wave get Fomorians to be his rowers, and when did he borrow a boat from them?" The Son had no word to answer him, but the ugliest of the ill-made lot came up to them with two cloaks in his hand that shone like the sea when the Sun strikes lights out of it. "These cloaks," said he, "are from the Land Under Wave; put one about your head, Gobhaun Saor, and you won't think the boat ugly or the journey long." "What did I tell you?" said the Son when he saw the cloaks. "You have your own asking of a token, and if you turn back now in spite of the way I shortened the road for you, I'll go myself and I'll have luck with me." "I'll go with you," said the Gobhaun Saor; he took the cloaks and they stepped into the boat. He put one round his head the way he wouldn't see the ugly oarsmen, and the Son took the other.

As they were coming near land the Gobhaun Saor looked out from the cloak, and when he saw the place he pulled the cloak from his Son's head and said: "Look at the land we are coming to." It was a dark, dreary, death-looking country without grass or trees or sun in the sky. "I'm thinking it won't take long to spend the fortune you'll make here," said the Gobhaun Saor, "for this is not the Land Under Wave but the country of Balor of the Evil Eye, the King of the Fomorians." He stood up then and called to the chief of the oarsmen: "You trapped us with lies and with cloaks stolen from the Land Under Wave, but you'll trap no one else with the cloaks," and he flung them into the sea. They sank at once as if hands pulled them down. "Let them go back to their owners," said the Gobhaun Saor.

The Fomorians ground their teeth and cursed with rage, but they were afraid to touch the Gobhaun or his Son because Balor wanted them; so they guarded them carefully and brought them to the King. He was a big mis-shapen giant with a terrible eye that blasted everything, and he lived in a great dun made of glass as smooth and cold as ice. "You are a fire-smith and a wonder-smith, and your Son is a wise man," he said to the Gobhaun. "I have brought the two of you here to put fire under a pot for me." "That is no hard task," said the Gobhaun. "Show me the pot." "I will," said Balor, and he brought them to a walled-in place that was guarded all round by warriors. Inside was the largest pot the Gobhaun Saor had ever laid eyes on; it was made of red bronze riveted together, and it shone like the Sun. "I want you to light a fire under that pot," said Balor." "None of my own people can light a fire under it, and every fire over which it is hung goes out. Your choice of good fortune to you if you put fire under the pot, and clouds of misfortune to you if you fail, for then neither yourself nor your Son will leave the place alive."

"Let every one go out of the enclosure but my Son and myself," said the Gobhaun Saor, "until we see what power we have." They went out, and when the Gobhaun Saor got the place to himself he said to the Son: "Go round the pot from East to West, and I will go round from West to East, and see what wisdom comes to us." They went round nine times, and then the Gobhaun Saor said: "Son, what wisdom came to you?" "I think," said the Son, "this pot belongs to the Dagda Mor." "There is truth on your tongue," said the Gobhaun, "for it is the Cauldron of Plenty that used to feed all the men of Ireland at one time, when the Dagda had it, and every one got out of it the food he liked best. It was by stealth and treachery the Fomorians got it, and that is why they cannot put fire under it." With that he let a shout to the Fomorians: "Come in now, for I have wisdom on me." "Are you going to light the fire," said the Son, "for the robbers that have destroyed Ireland?" "Whist," said the Gobhaun Saor; "who said I was going to light the fire?" "Tell Balor," he said to the Fomorians that came running in, "that I must have nine kinds of wood freshly gathered to put under the pot and two stones to strike fire from. Get me boughs of the oak, boughs of the ash, boughs of the pine tree, boughs of the quicken, boughs of the blackthorn, boughs of the hazel, boughs of the yew, boughs of the whitethorn, and a branch of bog myrtle; and bring me a white stone from the door step of a Brugh-fer, and a black stone from the door step of a poet that has the nine golden songs, and I will put fire under the pot."

They ran to Balor with the news, and he grew black with rage when he heard it. "Where am I to get boughs of the oak, boughs of the ash, boughs of the pine tree, boughs of the quicken, boughs of the blackthorn, boughs of the hazel, boughs of the yew, boughs of the whitethorn and a branch of bog myrtle in a country as barren as the grave?" said he. "What poet of mine knows any songs that are not satires or maledictions, and what Brugh-fer have I who never gave a meal's meat to a stranger all my life? Let him tell us," said Balor, "how.the things are to be got?" They went back to the Gobhaun Saor then and asked how the things were to be got. "It is hard," said the Gobhaun, "to do anything in a country like this, but since you have none of the things, you must go to the Land of the De Danaans for them. Let Balor's Son and his Sister's Son go to my house in Ireland and ask the woman of the house for the things."

Balor's Son set out and the Son of Balor's Sister with him. Balor's Druids sent a wind behind them that swept them into the country of the De Danaans like a blast of winter. They came to the house of the Gobhaun Saor, and the wife of the Son came out to them. "O Woman of the House," said they, "we have a message from the Gobhaun Saor." He is to light a fire for Balor, and he sent us to ask you for boughs of the oak, boughs of the ash, boughs of the pine tree, boughs of the quicken, boughs of the blackthorn, boughs of the hazel, boughs of the yew, boughs of the whitethorn and a branch ot bog myrtle. "You are to give us," he said, "a white stone from the door step of a Brugh-fer, and a black stone from the door step of a poet that has the nine golden songs."

"A good asking," said the woman, "and welcome before you!" "Let the Son of Balor come into the secret chamber of the house." He came in, and she said: "Show me the token my man gave you." Now, Balor's Son had no token, but he wouldn't own to that, so he brought out a ring and said: "Here is the token." The woman took it in her hand, and when she touched it she knew that it belonged to Balor's Son, and she went out of the room from him and locked the door on him with seven locks that no one could open but herself.

She went to the other Fomorian then and said: "Go to Balor and tell him I have his Son, and he will not get him back till I get back the two that went from me, and if he wants the things you ask for he must send a token from my own people before I give them."

Balor was neither to hold nor to bind when he got this news. "Man for man," he said; "she kept one and she'll get back one, but I'll have my will of the other. The Gobhaun Saor will pay dear for sending my Son on a fool's errand." He called to his warriors and said: "Shut the Gobhaun Saor and his Son in my strongest dun and guard it well through the night. To-morrow I'll send the Son to Ireland and get back my own Son, and to-morrow I'll have the blood of the Gobhaun Saor."

The Gobhaun Saor and his Son were left in the dun without light, without food, and without companions. Outside they could hear the heavyfooted Fomorians, and the night seemed long to them. "My sorrow," said the Son, "that ever I brought you here to seek a fortune, but put a good thought on me now, father, for we have come to the end of it all." "I needn't blame your wit," said the father, "that had as little myself. Why did I send only two messengers? Why didn't I send a lucky number like three? Then she could have kept two and send one back. Troth, from this out every fool will know there's luck in odd numbers!"

"If we had light itself," said the Son, "it wouldn't be so hard, or if I had a little pipe to play a tune on." He thought of the little reed pipe he was making the day the three Fomorians came to him, and he began to search in the folds of his belt for it. His hand came on the lock of wool he got from Mananaun, and he drew it out. "O the fool that I was," he said, "not to think of this sooner!" "What have you there?" said the Gobhaun. "I have a lock of wool from the Sea-God, and it will help me now when I need help." He drew it through his fingers and said: "Give me light!" and all the dun was full of light. He divided the wool into two parts and said: "Be cloaks of darkness and invisibility!" and he had two cloaks in his hand coloured like the sea where the shadow is deepest. "Put one about you," he said to the Gobhaun, and he drew the other round himself. They went to the door, it flew open before them, a sleep of enchantment came on the guards and they went out free. "Now," said the Son of the Gobhaun Saor, "let a small light go before us; and a small light went before them on the road, for there were no stars in Balor's sky. When they came to the Dark Strand the Son struck the waters with his cloak and a boat came to him. It had neither oars nor sails; it was pure crystal, and it was shining like the big white star that is in the sky before sunrise. "It is the Ocean-Sweeper," said the Gobhaun. "Mananaun has sent us his own boat!" "My thousand welcomes before it," said the Son, "and good fortune and honour to Mananaun while there is one wave to run after another in the sea!"

They stepped into the boat, and no sooner had they stepped into it than they were at the White Strand, for the Ocean-Sweeper goes as fast as a thought goes, and takes the people she carries at once to the place they have their hearts on. "It is a good sight our own land is!" said the Gobhaun when his feet touched Ireland. "It is," said the Son, "and may we live long to see it!" There was no stopping after that till they reached the house of the Gobhaun, and right glad was the Woman of the House to see them. They told her all their story, and she told them how she had seven locks on Balor's Son. "Let him out now," said the Gobhaun, "and ask the men of Ireland to a feast and let the Fomorian take back a good account of the treatment he got."

Well, there was the feast of the world that night. The biggest pot in the Gobhaun's house was hung up, and the Gobhaun himself put fire under it. He took boughs of the oak, boughs of the ash, boughs of the pine tree, boughs of the quicken, boughs of the blackthorn, boughs of the hazel, boughs of the yew, boughs of the whitethorn, and a branch of bog-myrtle. He got a white stone from the door-step of a Brugh-fer, and a black stone from the door-step of a poet that had nine golden songs. He struck fire from the stones and the flames leaped up under the pot, red blue and scarlet and every colour of the rainbow.

It is not dark or silent Gobhaun's house was that night, and if all the champions on the golden crested ridge of the world had come into it with the hunger of seven years on them they could have lost it without trouble at Gobhaun's feast.

The Goban Saor.

By Lady Gregory.

I noticed some time ago, when listening to many legends of the Fianna, that it is about Finn, the greatest of all, that the more grotesque of the stories have gathered. The Goban Saor, whose memory is also dear to the people, has like him become grotesque through the tales of many generations. Was he god? Was he saint? Was he master-builder? Or about which of the three do the stories shape themselves? One remembers the poem in an old manuscript, written in Christian times:-

"There remains a fort of Tuain Inbhir . . . with its stars last night; with its sun, with its moon.  
"Gobhan made that; let its story be perceived by you; my heartlet. God ofheaven, he is the thatcher that thatched it.  
"A house where thou gettest not moisture; a place wherein thou findes tnot spearpoints. More radiant it is than a garden, and it without an *udracht* round it."

Monsignor Fahey, in writing of Kilmacduagh, said to have been built by the Goban Saor, says:- "Nor is Goban a mere myth . . . he is not only remarkable for his name as an architect, but for the far higher distinction of being ranked among our early saints." But O'Curry, setting him as contemporary with S. Molaing, yet quotes from the Dinnsenchus:- "The Strand of Tuirbhi, whence was it named? It is not hard to tell. Tuirbhi of the Strand, the father of Goban Saor, it was he owned the Strand. He it was, the rusty-faced, big black fellow that used to throw a cast of his hatchet from Tulach m-Bhiail in the face of the flowing tide, and it used to stop the flowing of the sea, and the sea used not to come in past it. It is not known of what stock was his race, unless he was of the mystical black race who went out of Tara from the heroic Lugh." At the time of the battle of Magh Tuiread, we learn from the manuscripts, it was Giobniu the smith who made a new spear and a new sword for every one that was broken. "And no spearpoint that will be made by my hand," he said, "will ever miss its mark; and no man it touches will ever taste life again." And when Bodb Dearg's daughter came to St. Patrick to ask leave to marry the King of Connacht, he asked her how it was she stayed at "the very height of her comeliness," and she said, "Everyone that drank at Giobniu's feast, no sickness or wasting ever comes upon them." For it was Giobniu's ale that gave lasting life and youth.

But whether god, saint, or builder, or whether three distinct persons to whom the attributes of skill and science beyond the common have clung, there is not much of dignity left in the legends of to-day. The people who claim him as the builder of Kilmacduagh say:-

"The Goban was the master of sixteen trades. There was no beating him; he had got the gift. 

"He went one time to Quin Abbey when it was building, looking for a job, and the men were going to their dinner, and he had poor clothes, and they began to jibe at him, and the foreman said, 'Make now a cat and nine tails while we are at our dinner if you are any good.' And he took the chisel and cut it in the rough in the stone, a cat with nine tails coming from it, and there it was complete when they came out from their dinner. There was no beating him.

"He learned no trade, but he was a master of sixteen. That is the way, a man that has the gift will get more out of his own
brain than another will get through learning. There is many a man without learning will get the better of a college bred man, and will have better words too. Those that make inventions in these days have the gift, such a man now as Edîson, with all he has got out of electricity."

And in other places round about they say "The Goban Saor was a mason and a smith, and he could do all things, and he was very witty. He wanted his son to get a witty wife.

"The Goban Saor was going from home one time, and he said to his wife, 'If it is a daughter you have this time, I'll kill you when I come back'; for up to that time he had no sons, but only daughters. And it was a daughter she had, but a neighbouring woman had a son at the same time, and they made an exchange to save the life of the Goban's wife But when the boy began to grow up he had no wit, and the Goban knew by that he was no son of his. That is the reason he wanted a witty wife for him."

Another story says:- "The Goban Saor had a son that wanted to get married. So there came a girl to the house one day, and the Goban Saor bade her look round at all that was in the room, and he said, 'Do you think a couple could get a living out of this?' 'They could not,' she said. So he said she wouldn't do, and he sent her away. "Another girl came another day, and he bade her take notice of all that was in the house, and he said, 'Do you think could a couple knock a living out of this?' 'They could if they stopped in it,' she said. So he said that girl would do. Then he asked her could she bring a sheepskin to the market and bring back the price of it and the skin itself. She said she could, and she went to the market, and there she pulled off the wool and sold it, and brought back the price and the skin as well. Then he asked could she go to the market and not be dressed or undressed. And she went, having only one shoe and one stocking on her, so she was neither dressed or undressed. Then he sent her to walk neither on the road or off the road, and she walked on the path beside it. So he said then she would do as a wife for his son.

"They were walking the road together one day, and the Goban said to the son, 'Shorten the road for me.' So the son began to walk fast, thinking that would do it, but the Goban sent him back home when he didn't understand what to do. The next day they were walking again, and the Goban said again to shorten the road for him, and this time he began to run, and the Goban sent him home again. When he went in the second time and told the wife he was sent home the second time, she began to think, and she said, 'When he bids you shorten the road, it is that he wants you to be telling him stories.' For that is what the Goban meant, but it took the daughter-in-law to understand it."

A weaver's wife at a little Connemara village joined me one day when I was walking up a road. She told me of the Goban Saor's son¡ and of the girl who brought back the sheepskin and the price of it, and what a witty wife she made to the witless son.

She told me then how "one time some great king or lord sent for the Goban to build a *caislean* for him, and the son's wife said to him before he went, 'Be always great with the women of the house, and always have a comrade among them.' So when the Goban went there he coaxed one of the women the same as if he was not married.

"And when the castle was near built, the woman told him the lord was going to play him a trick, and to kill him or shut him up when he has the castle made, the way he would not build one for any other lord that was as good. And as she said, the lord came and bade the Goban to make a cat and two tails, for no one could make that but himself, and it was meaning to kill him on it he was. And the Goban said he would do that when he had finished the castle, but he could not finish it without some tool he had left at home. And they must send the lord's son for it he said, for it would not be given to any other one. So the son was sent, and the Goban sent a message to the daughter-in-law that the tool he was wanting was called 'When you open it,shut it.' And she was surprised, for there was no such tool in the house; but she guessed by the message what she had to do, and there was a big chest in the room, and she set it open. 'Come now,' she said to the young man, 'look in the chest and find it for yourself.' And when he looked in she gave him a push forward, and in he went, and she shut the lid on him. She wrote a letter to the lord then, saying he would not get his son back till he had sent her her own two men, and they were sent back to her."

Then she told me the story of shortening the road, and I said, "You have done that for me"; and she said, "It is what I was saying to that other woman, that if one of ourselves was making a journey, if we had another along with us, it would not seem to be one-half as long as if we would be alone; and if that is so with us, it is much more with a stranger, and so I went up the hill with you to shorten the road."

In Galway Workhouse an old woman told me- "The Goban and his son were seven years building the castle, and they never said a word all that time. And at the end of the seven years the son was at the top, and he said, 'I hear a cow lowing.' And the Goban said then, 'Make all strong below you, for the work is done.' And they went home.

"The Goban never told the secret of his building, and when he was on the bed dying they wanted to get it from him, and they went in and said, 'Claregalway Castle is after falling in the night.' And the Goban said, 'How can that be when I put a stone in and a stone out and a stone across.' So then they knew the way he built so well." And near the castle that he had built so well, I heard that the Goban was from Connemara, and that "one time he was on the road going to the town, and there was a Scotch rogue on the road that was always trying what could he pick off others, and he saw the Connemara man, that was the Goban, had a nice cravat, and he thought he would get a hold of that.

"So he began talking with him, and he was boasting of all the money he had, and the Goban said whatever it was, he had three times as much as it, and he with only £30 in the world.

And the Scotch rogue thought he would get some of it from him, and he said he would go to a house in the town, and he gave him some food and some drink there, and the Goban said he would do the same for him on the morrow. So then the Goban went out to three houses, and in each of them he left £10 of his £30, and he told the people in every house what they had to do, and that when he would strike the table with his hat three times they would bring out the money.

"So then he asked the Scotch rogue into the first house, and ordered every sort of food and drink, £10 worth in all. And when they had used all they could of it,he struck with his hat on the table, and the man of the house brought out the food and the drink, and then he brought out the £10, and the Goban said, 'Keep that to pay what I owe you.'

"The second day he did the same thing in another house. And the third house they went to he ordered £10 worth of food and drink in the same way. And when the time came to pay, he struck the table with the hat, and there was the money in the hand of the man of the house before them. 'That's a good little caubeen,' said the Scotch rogue, 'when striking it on the table makes all that money appear.' 'It is a wishing hat,' said the Goban. 'Anything I wish for I can get it as long as I have that.' 'Would you sell it?' said the Scotch rogue. 'I would not,' said the Goban. 'I have another at home, but I wouldn't sell one or the other.' 'You may as well sell it,so long as you have another at home,' said the Scotch rogue. 'What will you give for it?' says the Goban. 'Will you give £300 for it?' 'I will give that,' says the Scotch rogue, 'when it will bring me all the wealth I wish for,' So he went out, and he brought the £300 and gave it to the Goban, and he got the caubeen and went away with it, and it not worth three ha'pence."

"There was no beating the Goban. Wherever he got it, he had got the gift."

The Goban Saor
by W. W.

Publication date 1833-10-05

THE GOBAN SAOR.

Sir — Having observed some reference, in the late numbers of your valuable Journal, to this remarkable person, I beg to forward a few additional particulars which you may deem not altogether unworthy of insertion.

I had frequently heard, among other traditional stories, that the burial place of the Goban Saor was an island in the Bog of Allen, called "Deire na Bplanne," about two miles from Killenaule, in the County of Tipperary. As I was returning home, on Thursday last, from a visit to the stately ruins of Athassel Abbey, (where I had the pleasure of seeing the effigy of William de Burgo, the founder of this magnificent structure, about the year 1200, together with the fragment of a tombstone, bearing the date, MCCCCIIIVI— I suppose 1456-the oldest I had ever met in my researches in Ireland,) I observed, on passing through the bog, at a distance of two miles from the road, a small island, on the summit of which was an ancient ruin of considerable size; it struck me that this might have been the burial place of which I had so often heard, and, on stopping to enquire of a peasant what place it was, received for answer—"That, Sir, is Deire na Bplanne, where himself is buried." "Who is buried there?" said I. "What, Sir," said he, "did you never hear of the Goban Saor?" "Indeed," I" replied, "I often did — and no later than yesterday read in the Penny Journal, that there were reasons to believe that a celebrated architect, of that name, actually lived in Ireland so long ago as the sixth century; but whom can I get to show me his burial place?" "If you will venture through the bog, I shall accompany you with pleasure. Sir." Upon this, quitting my car, and led by my active guide, whom I found to be an intelligent and communicative young man, what with leaping, picking steps, and occasionally sinking to my knees in the marsh, exposed to a scorching sun, I made my way first to a smaller island, and from thence to the place of my destination; and at the top of the hillock which formed the island, my guide pointed out to me w hat he called the tombs of the Goban Saor and his twelve journeymen. These consisted of two cairns, and four oblong, and one round stone, which I shall thus particularize:—

No. 1, which my guide called the tombstone of the Goban himself, a very ancient coffin-shaped stone, measuring five feet and a half in length, and one foot and a half in breadth at the upper part, and thirteen inches at the lower. On the upper part was carved, in relief, but now much defaced, the head and neck of a man; the head is fitted into a separate hollow stone, having a corresponding hollow on the opposite side, as if for another head. The body o£ the stone is adorned with annulets and other devices.

No. 2, a like stone, four feet and a half by fourteen inches, having also a head engraved on it.

No. 3 is four feet four inches long, and two feet sir inches broad at top, and one foot five inches at the lower part. This stone has two heads a few inches apart.

No. 4 is one foot and a half long, and one foot m breadth, having carved on it two heads, with the backs to use the expression of my guide, "*facing* each, other;" the rest are all placed horizontally.

No. 5 is a large round stone, hollowed on one side, and within the hollow is a human face carved. The tombstones are all laid indiscriminately, without regard to the points of the compass, and have the appearance of great antiquity.

Having remained among the tombs as long as time would permit, for night was approaching, and I had a long journey before me, I paid a short visit to the venerable ruin on the summit of the island, which seemed to have been a small monastery, to which was attached an ancient church, of excellent workmanship, the chancel of which alone remained in a state of tolerable preservation. This was twenty-seven feet by fifteen, having, in the east end, two narrow stone windows, three similar ones in the south, and one in the north; and in the south wall a font for holy water, with a handsome round arch, curiously wrought.

My guide "shortened my journey" by the following story, explanatory of the name of the island, which, indeed, I had heard before among the peasantry:— "Deire na Bplanne means the end or termination of the planks. The Goban Saor having been barbarously murdered, together with his journeymen, by twelve highwaymen, the murderers proceeded to his house and told the Goban's wife, with an air of triumph, that they had killed her husband. She, appearing nowise concerned, asked them to assist her in drawing open the trunk of a tree, which the Goban had been cutting up into planks. They put in their hands for the purpose, when, drawing out n wedge, she left them literally in a cleft sticky and, taking up an axe, cut off all their heads a$ a blow."

I now leave it to some of your antiquarian correspondents tb judge whether the popular tradition has any foundation in truth, which fixes the scene of my Thursday's pilgrimage, as the tomb of the Goban Saor.

I am. Sir, &c. &c, W. W

pp.183-

In treating of the ancient churches it would, perhaps, be ungracious to pass over in silence the name of a celebrated native architect of that period. This was the Goban Saor, whose name still lives in the traditions of the people, and who, in story and legend, is represented as a prodigy in the architectural and mechanical arts. Among other works ascribed to him, tradition states that he was the builder of the old church of Kilmacduagh, in the county of Galway, and of the round tower near it, which, like that of Pisa in Italy, exhibits the singular feature of leaning or declining many feet from the perpendicular.

Goban Saor means (*Goban*, pronounced *gubbawn*), "the artificer or mechanist," a title bestowed on him by universal consent on account of his great pre-eminence as a working architect. There is scarcely a stone-mason or carpenter in Ireland of any standing, and with any pretensions to a knowledge of professional lore, who cannot tell a dozen stories respecting the wonderful powers of Goban Saor. It is stated that, when a very young man, and in want of employment, he came to a place where a large number of tradesmen were building a church for an old abbot. He applied to the overseer, or foreman, for employment on the work. The young man's statement of his accomplishments and of what he was able to do, appeared rather pompous to the surly old official. Still he consented to take him on trial for a few days. It was just about noon, the time of the day when the men went to dinner. The overseer was also retiring; nor did he remember to invite the stranger to partake of his hospitality. Goban asked him what might he himself be making (doing) while they were away. The foreman replied, in half irony, half indifference, that he may make a cat with two tails if he liked (*dean cat is dha earbaill, mas math leat e*). "Very well," said Goban. With the assistance of the working tools which lay scattered on the ground, he, at once, commenced to execute the apparently impossible task. It was in the hot season of summer, and the workmen were in no great hurry to return from their repast, and mid-day repose, or rest. Tradition does not say by what means Goban accomplished the feat, whether it was by secret springs or by a combination of wheels, artfully introduced into the body of the automaton; but when the men returned to their work, they beheld the strange sight of a cat with two tails jumping about on the grounds. As the old foreman could not resist the evidence of his eyes in the matter, he ascribed the whole thing to magic. The abbot himself was called to behold the wonder. After admiring it for some time, he called the young artist to his presence. The words of this interview are not recorded; but Goban was invited by him into the monastery, where refreshments were immediately provided for the stranger, and a promise given him that while he was employed on these works every just consideration should be extended to him. Before the church and other edifices in connection with it were finished, Goban was universally acknowledged to be the most clever of his fellow-workmen, and pre-eminently the master of all in everything that required either creative genius or delicate handling. In reference to a person of great mechanical abilities, there is still in Ireland often used the expression, that "he would make a cat with two tails which would jump over a house, like the Goban Saor."

Another story says that Goban was, at one time, engaged to build a grand residence for a local chief, or petty king, in a remote part of the country. When the work was approaching completion, and fully displaying its beautiful proportions, this savage chief was so enchanted with it, that he conceived the horrid idea of putting the architect to death, to prevent any other man in the land from ever possessing a similar residence. When Goban was a young man, leaving home to seek his fortune in the world, his clever mother, while giving her consent and her blessing, among other admonitions, advised him, wherever he should go, to make for himself friends among the women. His genius and fine natural qualities, coupled with the advice thus imparted, made him a great favourite in that quarter. It was very useful to him now. A female of the family, who by some means had discovered the intentions of the chief, informed him of the danger, and advised him to escape from it with all the tact and expedition he could command. In a day or two the chief went to inspect the work, and inquired of the architect how soon he expected to have it finished. This inquiry was suggestive of serious thought, and no small apprehension. Goban, without exhibiting any emotion, said that it was now fast approaching completion, and that it only wanted a few finishing touches, for which it would be necessary for him to go to his own home to bring with him a certain instrument, which was specially designed for effecting such improvement. The chief would not listen to any proposition for his departure. He said that he would send his own son, a youth of about twenty years old, with two servants, on horses, to bring the instrument. Goban had to submit. His resources, however, did not fail him. When the youth, who probably knew nothing of the intentions of the cruel father, was brought to Goban, to obtain from him the name of this engine, or tool, the architect told him, in the presence of the chief, that it was called "the crooked and the straight," *an cam is an direach*; that the members of his family were well acquainted with these things, and that his daughter-in-law, especially, knew where to find it.

Goban's residence was situated at a considerable distance, in the territories of another petty king. The youth and his attendants, on arriving at the place, delivered their message. They were received with kindness and hospitality. The name of the strange tool, however, excited some suspicion. In the architect's entire collection there was no such thing as the *cam is an direach*, the crooked and the straight, and the daughter-in-law, who was a sharp clever woman, at once suspected that there was some mystery in that strange name. She was not satisfied with the reasons they gave why Goban himself had not come for it, and why he had not visited his home, at all, for so long a time. After some consultation by the family, it was decided that the two attendants would be permitted to return to the chief for further explanations, but that his son should be retained as hostage, till inquiry should be made respecting the circumstances and the safety of Goban. The result was, that not only was the architect permitted to return safe from the territory of his would-be murderer, but that he was also enabled to bring with him the cattle, corn, and even the ornaments of gold which he was to receive as payment for the execution of the work.

The stories in circulation about this celebrated mechanist would fill a volume. Of these some are the written productions of bardic chroniclers, others are handed down solely by oral tradition. In them, even, is preserved the memory of his father Traigh Tuirbi, and of his wonderful feats, also, as a wielder of the hatchet, and an architect. The legend may be silly, extravagant, and highly incredible in itself, but its presence is generally indicative of some remarkable qualities in the character or person whom it follows. It follows Goban Saor, and he was one of the long line of clever artificers who built the ancient churches of Ireland, and, also, erected those tall, graceful, and solid Round Towers which bear upon them the marks of great age, and which, in valley, island, and on hill-side, are now found standing, in single and mystic loneliness, near a ruin which was once a church, or near a church which is only the distant successor of the original sacred structure.

Pre-1917

p135-45

THE GOBAN SAOR.

THE Goban Saor was a great architect or builder who lived in Ireland in ancient days. He is not an imaginary personage, as some people think, but a real historic Irishman who lived about one hundred years after the time of St. Patrick. He is mentioned in Irish manuscripts that are believed to have been written in the eighth century. His father's name was Turvey, who lived on the coast of Dublin, for it is said that it is from him Turvey Bay got its name. On the map Turvey Bay will be seen as a little inlet north of Malahide Bay, and it is now crossed by the Great Northern Railway. According to the Irish manuscripts the Goban Saor built a great many of the churches and oratories for the early Irish saints. His charge for these services was very high, and as the saints were generally poor men, these charges fell very heavily on them. As a punishment from heaven for these excessive charges Goban lost his sight, but it was temporarily restored to him while building a church for St. Abbon in the present King's County.

He also built — before he became blind — an oratory for St. Moling of Ferns, about which a peculiar story is told in the old manuscripts.

Goban's company, it is said, consisted of eight carpenters and their eight wives, and eight boys. They continued with the saint for a whole year without commencing the work, and during this time their entertainment was never the worse. Every morning Goban used to urge them to go to the wood, but the company was so pleased with St. Moling's entertainment that they thought it too soon the work would be completed. At the end of the year Goban said, "Let us go to-day in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost." Then they went and began felling the trees for the building. While the oratory was being constructed Goban's wife received a present of a milch cow from the saint. This cow was soon afterwards stolen by a notorious thief who infested the neighbourhood. St. Moling sent a party of his people after the thief, and they found him about to roast the cow, which he had killed, at a large fire on the brink of the river Barrow. When he saw them he quickly climbed a high tree which grew near, but one of the party wounded him with a spear, and he fell into the Barrow and was drowned. The party then carried the dead cow back to St. Moling, and he restored her to life. Then Goban's wife demanded the cow as hers, but St. Moling refused to give her up, and the woman returned in high anger to her husband.

Goban had just finished the building of the oratory, and his wife threatened that she would not henceforth live with him unless he demanded from the saint as the price of his work the full of the building of rye. Goban demanded this.

"Invert it," said St. Moling, "and it shall be filled for thee."

St. Moling evidently believed this could not be done, but Goban and his men applied machinery and force to the oratory, so that they turned it upside down, and not a plank of it went out of its place, and not a joint of a plank gave way in the smallest degree, so firmly and perfectly was the work of construction done.

St. Moling had to make extraordinary efforts to procure sufficient rye to fill the inverted oratory, and had to lay all his people and all their friends under contribution. But at length the building was filled up, and Goban Saor departed with this immense booty; but when he examined it on the next day, he discovered to his dismay that it had turned into a heap of maggots. Thus was his own avarice and his wife's vengeance both equally foiled.

These are some of the stories about the famous Irish architect that have come down to us in books, but there are a great many other stories told of him by the Irish people, that have come down by tradition. The following are some of these.

It is said that it was he who built all the castles and palaces that were of old Erin, and some would even credit him with having built the round towers. His fame was so great that kings in England and Scotland used to send for him whenever they wanted a castle built.

The castles at that time were nearly all built of wood. It was not because they did not then know how to build with stone; but building with stone is difficult, and besides, good stones could not be had without quarrying rocks, and they had no powder or dynamite in those days for blasting rocks as we have now. On the other hand, wood was plentiful: the country was covered with forests, and anyone could have as much timber as he liked for the mere trouble of cutting down the trees. Then these trees were sawn into great planks, and planed, and often beautifully carved, and then polished or painted. These wooden houses and castles were built with great skill, and if kept well roofed they would last for hundreds of years.

No man could build these castles as well or make them as grand as the Goban Saor; and he had a son who was almost as good an artificer as himself.

It is told of the son that when he first went out to take part in building, the older craftsmen imagined that one so young and boyish-looking knew nothing of the builder's trade; so when the lad asked for something to do one of them derisively told him to make a wedge. The young fellow asked where was the wedge to go, and on being shown this he took the measure of the hole so accurately with his eye that he made a perfectly fitting wedge or pin. Then he asked again to be shown where the wedge was to go, and the workman put his finger into the hole, still laughing at the boy. But the latter cast the wedge with such force and accuracy of aim that the man's finger was hopelessly locked in the aperture, and as the wedge could not be extracted the finger had to be amputated. It was perhaps a severe lesson, but all the craftsmen treated Goban' s son ever afterwards with the respect becoming a fully qualified artificer.

Now the Goban was growing old, and he wished to see his son married before he died. He knew that a good wife is a great blessing to a man, and a bad wife a great curse; and so he wanted to make sure that his son got a good one. Some people choose a wife because she is pretty, and some because she is rich, but what the Goban wanted for his son was a wife who would be very wise. He was a clever man himself, and he did not like dull, stupid people.

One day the Goban bade a servant of his to kill and skin a sheep. When this was done, he told his son to take the skin to the fair, and bring back the skin and the price of it. This was a strange task, but the Goban's son was very obedient, and always did exactly as his father told him, for he knew his father was wiser, and had more knowledge than he had. So he took the skin to the fair, and to those who asked him his business he replied that he wanted the skin and the price of it. And everyone who heard this turned away laughing. At length a young girl came, and she offered to buy the hide on these terms. She got a pair of shears, and cut off all the wool, paid him for the wool, and gave him back the skin. It happened that at this time wool was very dear, and hides were very cheap, and so what he got from the girl was as much as the hide and wool were worth together. When he came home to his father the Goban asked him did he know where this girl lived. He said that he did. So the Goban sent her word to come on a visit to their house; but he told her not to come in the day time nor in the night time; not to come by the road, and not to cross the fields; and not to come alone, nor yet to have anyone with her. This seemed an order difficult to accomplish, but the girl managed it successfully. She came in the twilight, when it was neither day nor night. She neither walked on the roads nor in the fields, but she walked on the top of the fence that ran along the road. And she brought no person with her, but she took a dog, so that she was not all alone. The Goban was now satisfied that she was a clever, intelligent girl, and that she would make a good wife for his son, for she would be able to give him counsel and advice in any difficulty he might ever be in. So after some time she got married to the Goban's son.

Shortly after this the father and his son set out together, early one morning, for a distant place where they were going to build a castle for some king. There was a long journey before them. The Goban told his son to shorten the road for him.

"I cannot," replied the son.

"Go home, then," said his father.

The son turned home. When he came in to his young wife she asked him what was the matter.

"My father sent me home because I could not shorten the road for him," said he.

"Oh, is that all that is wrong?" said his wife. "Well I will tell you how to shorten the road for him. Begin telling him some wonderful story, and it does not matter whether it ever happened or not, but let everything in the story be more wonderful than what went before it, and never fear he will not send you home any more."

The young man set out again, and soon overtook his father, and did as his wife had told him. He started a great big story, and it was getting more and more wonderful as it went on, so that neither of them felt themselves getting over the ground, and they were at their journey's end before the story was finished.

Soon after this they were invited over to build a palace for the King of Scotland. When they were just starting, the son's wife gave him this advice: "Wherever you may be, whether in court or in castle, be sure and always make friends with the women. For," said she, "if you are on good terms with the women folk you will hear everything that is going on, and nothing bad will happen to you without your knowing it beforehand."

It turned out to be a good advice. As soon as Goban and his son had got to where the King of Scotland lived the young man set himself to make friends with the women. In the evening, after his day's work, he would tell them stories about all the places he had been in, and the strange things and people he had seen. He was a pleasant talker, and very soon the ladies of the court became delighted with his company.

All went well till the palace was nearly finished: and it was a beautiful palace, with tall towers, and every kind of grand decorations. But the king was a bad, wicked man, though Goban did not know it; and when the castle was nearly finished this wicked king said to himself that the handiest way to pay Goban and his son would be to kill them both. Besides, this would prevent them ever building so grand a palace for any other king. When he had his mind made up on this he told the queen what he was about to do, but warned her at the peril of her life not to speak of it to anyone. To tell the truth, the queen was sorry that such a fine, young, pleasant man as the Goban's son should be killed without his deserving it, and she told it to one of her maids as a great secret, and they both said it was a terrible pity. That maid told it, also as a great secret, to another maid, and at last one of them told the Goban's son himself, that he and his father were to be killed as soon as the castle was finished. He told his father, and they both considered what was best to be done. They were in the heart of Scotland, and if they ran away the king's soldiers would be sure to capture them before they had got to the coast, or had got into a ship that would carry them back to Ireland. They decided that it was best to remain on and try some other plan. The king used to come out every day now, and ask if the castle was finished, and Goban always told him that it was not. But one day Goban told him it was finished except for one thing.

"And what is that?" asked the king.

"Do you see that tower in the centre?" he asked; "there is something wrong with it, and if not made right it may fall. I have been trying for several days to set it right, but I cannot. And there is only one thing that will make it right, and that is an instrument I have at home in Ireland called 'Crooked against crooked and straight against straight.'"

"I'll send for it," said the King.

"Yes," replied Goban,  but it is an instrument I rarely use, and no one would get it but a king's son, so you would have to send your own son for it."

"I don't mind; I will send him for it," said the king.

So the King of Scotland's son was sent to Ireland for this instrument, and in due time he arrived at Goban's house, and told the wife of Goban's son what he wanted. Now there was no such instrument; but the name had a hidden meaning, which Goban knew his clever daughter-in-law would understand, and, true to her character, she did understand it. Its meaning was to oppose treachery to treachery and honesty to honesty. And she knew that if Goban and his son were being treated honestly they would never have sent her such a message. There was in the house a big chest called an "ark," which was used for holding meal, flour, etc. There were no shops in those days, and people had to lay in large stores of provisions for their own use. The ark was now empty, and it stood almost as high as a man. The clever woman raised the lid of this huge vessel, and told the king's son that the instrument he wanted was in the bottom of it, but that she could not reach to it. He stooped into the ark, but when she got him stooping in she caught hold of his feet, and hurled him bodily into the ark, then closed the lid, and locked him within. Speaking through the keyhole, she told him that she meant to do him no harm, but would detain him a prisoner until her husband and her father-in-law came back safe and sound. She at once sent word to the King of Scotland that she had his son locked up a close prisoner, and would keep him so until her friends came back to her. Now the King of Scotland had no son but this one, so, much against his will, he was forced to pay Goban and his son, and let them home. Then his own son was liberated and sent back to him. Goban was very thankful to his daughter-in-law who had thus saved his life.

At length Goban's son was murdered in Connacht, while building a palace there for some magnate of the time. His wife set out to discover the murderers, and to revenge the death of her husband. After much diligent inquiries she learned who the murderers were. They were craftsmen like her husband, and may have killed him owing to professional jealousy. At any rate this woman, bent on vengeance, discovered who they were, and she found them in a wood engaged in splitting a mighty oak they had felled. She watched them for a space, but they took no notice of her, not knowing who she was.

Then she addressed them and pointed out that their method of splitting the oak was a bad one. They inquired what method would she suggest, and she replied she would show them if she had an axe. One of them handed her an axe. There was already a deep split in the tree and into this split they had been forcing a thick wooden wedge. There were twelve saors or craftsmen present, all of whom had had a hand, either as actors or accessories, in the murder of her husband.

She placed six of them on either side of the tree trunk, and asked them to insert their fingers deep in the split already made, and pull against each other, and then, she promised, she would split the trunk with a couple of blows. The tradesmen regarded the proposed method as foolish, but to convince her they did as she directed. When they all had their fingers deep in the split, she, by one dexterous stroke, knocked the wedge clean out of the trunk, when the split closed up with a snap, leaving the twelve unfortunate men caught as if in a vice. Then she charged them with killing her husband, and told them she was now going to knock off all their heads. They piteously begged and besought her not to do this, and promised her immense rewards if she refrained from killing them. She told them that Erin undivided would not recompense her for the loss of her husband, and forthwith she struck off all their heads, and returned home satisfied with herself at having revenged her husband's death.

It would appear that Goban outlived his son and was now old and blind, but there were some secrets of his trade which he kept to himself. One of these was what was the best-grained wood in the forest.

One fine May morning his daughter-in-law came in to where Goban was. He inquired where she had been. She replied that she had been in the wood, and that the king of timbers had sent a message to Goban.

"Ah! the noble holly," he soliloquised.

"Now I know it," she exclaimed, "the holly is the best timber in the wood."

"Ah!" said Goban regretfully, "my secret is gone."

He did not long survive after this.

In view of this legend it is interesting to find in the Brehon laws the holly ranked among the noblest trees in the forest.

Almost fourteen hundred years have passed since Goban lived; but however long this span, his fame as a builder, and his daughter-in-law's fame as a clever woman, have never since been forgotten in Ireland.

THE PEASANT'S WISE DAUGHTER.

THERE was once upon a time a poor Peasant, who had no land, but merely a little cottage, and an only Daughter, who one day said to him, "We must ask the King for a piece of waste land."

Now, when the King heard of their poverty, he presented them with a corner of a field, which the man and his daughter tilled, and Prepared to sow in it corn and seeds. As they turned the land about they found a mortar of pure gold, and the Peasant said to his daughter, "Since his Majesty the King has been so gracious to us as to present us with this acre, we ought to give him this treasure."

But to this the Daughter would not agree, saying, "If we have the mortar, and not the pestle, we must procure the pestle for it; therefore be silent." However, the Father would not obey her, but took the mortar to the King, ahd said he had found it while tilling the ground, and asked the King if he would accept the offering. The King took it, and asked if he had found nothing more. "No," replied the Peasant. "Then," said the King, "you must procure the pestle for it." The Peasant said they had not found that; but it was of no use, he might as well have spoken to the wind, and he was ordered to be put in prison until he discovered it. The keepers had to bring him daily and water, which is all one gets in prison, and when they did. So they heard the man always lamenting, "Had I but obeyed my daughter! had I obeyed my daughter!" So these keepers went and told the King that the man was always crying, "Had I obeyed my daughter!" and would neither eat nor drink. His Majesty comnanded them to bring the prisoner before him, and then he asked him why he was always crying out in this manner, and what his daughter had said. "She told me," said the man, "not to bring the mortar to you before I had found the pestle." "What! have you such a wise daughter? let her come hither at once!" said the King. So the girl came, and the King asked her if she were so wise as was said, for he would propose a riddle, which if she solved he would then marry her. "What is that which is unclothed and yet is not naked, that moves along and yet neither nor walks, and that goes not in the road nor out of it?"

The girl said she would do her best, and went away and pins off all her clothes, so that she was not clothed; then she took a large fishing-net, and set herself in it, and wrapped it round her, so she was. not naked; then she bought an ass, and bound the net to its tail, so it dragged her along, and thus she neither rode nor walked. The ass, too, had to trail her along in a rut, so that she was neither in the road not out of it, for only her big toes touched the ground. Now, as the King saw her coming towards him, he said she had solved the riddle, and fulfilled all the conditions. Then he let her father out of prison, and made the daughter his bride, and committed to her all the royal possessions.

Several years had passed away, when once, as the King was on parade, it happened that several peasants, who had sold wood, stopped before the palace with their waggons: some of them oxen yoked and some horses, and one peasant had three horses, one of which was a young foal, which ran away, and laid itself down between two oxen who were in front of awaggon. Soon the peasants grouped together and began to quarrel, wrangle, and dispute with each other: the peasant with the oxen would keep the foal, saying that it belonged to him, while the peasant with the horses denied it, and said the foal was his, for his horses went with it. The quarrel was brought before the King, and he gave judgment that the foal should keep where it was, and so it passed into possession of the man with the oxen, to whom it did not belong. So the other went away weeping and lamenting for his foal; but he had heard that the Queen was a very kind woman, because she had herself been born of peasant folk, so he went to her, and asked her to help him that he might regain his own foal. The Queen said she would do so, and if he would promise not to betray her she would tell him how. Early in the morning when the King was on the watch-parade he was to place himself in the midst of the path by which he must pass, and take a large fish-net, and pretend to fish and shake the net about over the terrace as if it were full of fish. She told him, also, to answer if the King asked any questions; and the next day, accordingly, he stood there fishing in a dry place. When the King came by, and saw him, he sent his page to ask who the simpleton and what he was about. The peasant merely replied, "I am fishing." The page asked how he could fish where there was no water; amt the man replied, "So well as two oxen can bear a foal, so well can I fish in a dry place." With this answer the page left him, and told it to the King, who bade the peasant come before him, and asked him from whom the answer he made, for it could not be from himself, The man refused to tell, and replied to every question, "God forbid, I had it from myself." At last they laid him upon a heap of straw, and beat him and tortured him so long till at last he confessed that he had the answer from the Queen. As soon as the King returned home af wards, he said to his wife, "Why are you so false to me? I will no longer have you about me; your time is over, go away to whence you came—to your peasant's hut," Ks

He gave her leave, however, to take with her what she considered rest and best to herself, and the Queen said "Yes, dearest husband, 1 will do as you bid me," and she fell upon his breast and kissed him, and said she would take her leave. But first she made a strong sleeping-mixture to pledge him in, and the King took a long draught, but she drank only a little. Soon he fell into a deep sleep, when she perceived it was so, she called a servant, and, wrapping a fine white linen napkin over her lord's face, she caused him to be laid in a carriage, and drawn to the cottage from whence she first came. There she laid him in a bed, where he slept a night and a day, and when he awoke he looked round him amazed, and called for a servant, but none answered the call. At last came his wife to the bed, and said, "My dear lord and King, you commanded me to take out of the castle whatever I thought dearest and best, and because I had nothing dearer or better than you, I have brought you with me here."

At these words tears came into the King's eyes, and he said "Dear wife, you shall be mine and I will be thine!" and so he took her back again to the palace and there they are living still in the full enjoyment of health and happiness, for aught I know to the contrary.

p233-255

There was a king in Ireland long ago who gave an order that all over sixty years should be put to death. On the day that the king gave that order the Gobán Saor was just 60 years of age. He hid in a cave behind his house and then he being unable to earn money for his son and his son's wife he sent his son to work for the king. One evening the king came to the place where the men were working and said "I will give £5 to-morrow morning to the man who will be able to tell me what side is the upper side of a stick when the stick is cut and planed." When the Gobáns son arrived home that evening he told his father of what the king had said "A" said the Gobán "he is only trying to find out where I am for there is no man in Ireland knows that but I, anyway earn your £5." So the son got the five pounds. That evening the king came again and said "I will give £5 to-morrow to the man who will be able to tell me what is one's greatest friend? what loves one best? and who is ones greatest enemy. When the Goban's son told this to his father he said "To-morrow when you rise take your best friend the dog, your greatest enemy your wife, and what you love best your son to the king's palace. When the king came the Gobáns son told him his dog was his best friend. He loved his son best and his wife was his greatest enemy. "If I was your greatest enemy" said his wife "I would have told long ago that your father was hiding behind the house." That is what I want" said the king. The Gobán was then taken and bound up and a great fire was ready for the burning of the old man. There was a great crowd of people gathered and stories were been told by all the noble men. One noble-man who was asked to tell a story said he was not able but that he would give £50 to the man who would tell a story for him.

The wise old gobán's son said he would tell a story "but first Oh King" he said "will you promise me that anyone that contradicts me will be thrown into the fire instead of the old man". "Done" said the king. "Well" began the gobán saor "myself and my mother and grandmother sowed the whole of Ireland with oats in one day". - "Impossible" roared a fisherman and the poor fisherman was burned instead of the gobán.

In olden times there was a man who went under the name of the Gubawn Soar. One day he thought to himself that if he would make a plough without horses. It took him seven years to make the plough. When he had the plough made he went out one morning early. When he came in to breakfast he told him wife that he had seven acres ploughed. His wife said it was bad work in seven years.

He got vexed and out he went and broke the plough. There was no plough made of that kind before or after that.
