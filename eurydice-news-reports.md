The Home-Coming of the Eurydice

[Lost, with her crew of three hundred boys, on the last day of her voyage, March 23, 1876. She foundered off Portsmouth, from which town many of the boys came.]

Up with the royals that top the white spread of her!  
Press her and dress her, and drive through the foam;  
The Island's to port, and the mainland ahead of her,  
Hey for the Warner and Hayling and Home!

"Bo'sun, O Bo'sun, just look at the green of it!  
Look at the red cattle down by the hedge!  
Look at the farmsteading—all that is seen of it,  
One little gable end over the edge!"

"Lord! the tongues of them clattering, clattering,  
All growing wild at a peep of the Wight;  
Aye, sir, aye, it has set them all chattering,  
Thinking of home and their mothers to-night."

Spread the topgallants — oh, lay them out lustily!  
What though it darken o'er Netherby Combe?  
'Tis but the valley wind, puffing so gustily—  
On for the Warner and Hayling and Home!

"Bo'sun, O Bo'sun, just see the long slope of it!  
Culver is there, with the cliff and the light.  
Tell us, oh tell us, now is there a hope of it?  
Shall we have leave for our homes for to-night?"

"Tut, the clack of them! Steadily! Steadily!  
Aye, as you say, sir, they're little ones still;  
One long reach should open it readily,  
Round by St. Helens and under the hill.

"The Spit and the Nab are the gates of the promise,  
Their mothers to them—and to us it's our wives.  
I've sailed forty years, and—By God it's upon us!  
Down royals, Down top'sles, down, down, for your lives!"

A grey swirl of snow with the squall at the back of it,  
Heeling her, reeling her, beating her down!  
A gleam of her bends in the thick of the wrack of it,  
A flutter of white in the eddies of brown.

It broke in one moment of blizzard and blindness;  
The next, like a foul bat, it flapped on its way.  
But our ship and our boys! Gracious Lord, in your kindness,  
Give help to the mothers who need it to-day!

Give help to the women who wait by the water,  
Who stand on the Hard with their eyes past the Wight.  
Ah! whisper it gently, you sister or daughter,  
"Our boys are all gathered at home for to-night."

FOUNDERING OF H.M.S. EURYDICE OFF THE ISLE OF WIGHT.

FEARFUL LOSS OF LIFE.

PAINFUL EXCITEMENT THE TOWN AND DOCKYARD.

Since the memorable day in September, 187O, when H.M.S. Captain foundered off Cape Finisterre and when nearly all hands were drowned, no naval disaster has occurred of a nature so truly awful as that which it is our most painful duty to announce as having happened yesterday afternoon to H.M. training ship Eurydice, just as that ill-starred vessel was almost within sight of the harbour, where all on board were anxiously expecting the meeting of those the enforced separation from whom had been the chief cause of regret during the continuance of the voyage apparently so rapidly drawing to successful conclusion. The Eurydice was a training ship for youths of the rating of ordinary seamen, and every year it was the practice of the authorities to send her on deep sea cruise, for tha purpose of giving the young men forming her crew more thorough insight into their duties than any they could receive whilst quietly lying anchor in a land-locked harbour. Tho voyage from which she was returning had been made to the West Indies, and in addition to her crew, we have been informed that she had on board several time-expired men and invalids. We have telegraphed to London for a complete list, and trust to receive it in time for our third edition. So far as we have peon able to gather, she had favouring winds until she sighted the Lizard, and during her subsequent passage up the Channel until she arrived off the Isle of Wight on an afternoon so clear and pleasant as to resembla almost a summer day. However, about four o'clock the sun became obscured and the sky of a dull leaden colours, and a species of mist seemed to envelope the horizon. At the same it time began to snow, and the snow was accompanied with a biting wind of such strength (we had almost said ferosity) that people who a few minute* before had been walking and chatting gaily on the Southsea Common, were bent double by its force, whilst on the Portsdown Hill the dust was lifted and whirled towards the sky in masses resembling water-spouts. Into this storm of haze, and wind and snow, sailed the Eurydice, with every sail set, save and except her mizen-royal, and braced sharp on the port tack. She was seen no more !! A schooner, named the Emma, bound from Newcastle-on-Tyne to Poole, was also caught in the squall, but she weathered it successfully, and almost immediately the sun, we are told, came out again. The master of the schooner, on looking round, states that he saw wreckage, and thought that he heard cries, but there was no sign of the noble ship, which but a moment before had pursued her way proudly with all her studding sails set. Five men were rescued by those on board the Emma, and they were stripped, wrapped in blankets, rubbed, and received every possible attention ; but we much regret to say that three of them died on board, the other two, an A.B. named Benjamin Cuddiford, and a first-class boy, named Sydney Fletcher, of Bristol, were removed to the Cottage Hospital Bonchurch, where they received every attention, and are considered by Dr. Williamson, of Veutnor, to be progressing favourably. The following is the account given Benjamin Cuddiford:

"The ship capsized in a squall and snowstorm about four o clock, when we were five miles from Dunnose.

"There were over 300 men on board, all of whom, except myself, and Fletcher, are, I believe, lost.

"I was one of the last on board the ship. Captain Hare was near me when she went down after capsizing, and she carried with her a large number of men who were clinging to her, who were drawn down in the vortex.

"A man near me said that a vessel was close by when the squall came on, and therefore we should be sure to be picked up. I was more than hour the water, being a first-rate swimmer, and very many of my comrades cried out for help. I tried to assist two or three, but at last there were four clinging me, and I was obliged to kick them off. We were well taken care of by the master the schooner and crew. Our ship left Bermuda three week's ago passed the Lizard yesterday, and expected to anchor at about five o'clock."

SCENE AT THE DOCKYARD GATES.

The scene at the dockyard gates this morning was harrowing in the extreme. The gates this time of the year are opened at seven o'clock, but long before that hour crowds of anxious relatives had assembled in the faint hope that the awful news which had spread through the town during the night might prove after all to be, if not unfounded, at any rate exaggerated ; but tnere was no such comfort for the poor bereaved ones. The officials at the entrance broke the news to them as gently they could, but the scene was one that would have made an impression even on the callous-hearted. Mothers waiting for their sons, bonnie boys just bursting into manhood, and wives who had reason to believe that their husbands were among the time-expired men several of whom it was known had taken passage home by the Eurydice, mourning, only those who are suddenly widowed, can.

RETURN GOVERNMENT TUG "MANLY" TO THE DOCKYARD.

So soon was the accident was reported to the Admiral steamers were sent to the locality; but up to four o'clock, when the tug Manly returned, no bodies had been recovered. A party of riggers who went out in the tug have commenced work, but the divers have not yet gone down.

[Press Association Telegram.]

Our Ventnor correspondent telegraphs that the weather was beautifully fine yesterday afternoon, and every rope of the Eurydice could be distinguished about a mile off. With alarming suddenness a gale set in from the north-west, and surprise was expressed by old salts that the Eurydice did not shorten sail, she having even her standing-sails set. The thick weather concealed her when passing Dunnose Head, and when the weather cleared she was not to be seen. The schooner Emma, of Newcastle, was observed to be lowering boats, only five, however, were rescued. Medical aid was obtained from shore, but three of them were so exhausted that they died shortly afterwards. Two— Cuddiford and Fletcher,— were removed to the College Hospital and soon recovered. Fletcher states that he was below with the greater part of the crew, when, hearing a noise, he rushed up the hatchway aud heard the cry, "All hands for themselves." He caught life buoy, and jumped overboard, as did the others who were picked up. A minute afterwards the ship gave a lurch forward and sank drawing him down a considerable distance, but the life buoy raised him again. The vessel now lies two miles off Luccombe chine. Several gunboats are cruising round the spot, and attempts will be made to raise her. There is some hope that the barque seen near the spot may saved others.

NAMES OF THE PASSENGERS.

We have received a telegram from the Admiralty informing us that the names of the passengers are not known, but that we shall be informed of their ratings, and these, together with later particulars, we hope publish in our subsequent editions.

The following account was received by one of our reporters from an official connected with one of the tugs, which returned from the wreck in the early morning :—

Her Majesty's training-ship Eurydice, commanded by Captain Marcus Hare, capsized about half-past four yesterday afternoon off Dunnose, Isle of Wight. She left Bermuda on the afternoon of the 6th inst. with between three hundred and three hundred and sixty men on board, and was expected here in few days. At four o'clock yesterday afternoon, she was seen by the schooner Emma standing the eastward under all plain sail and courses. She was then braced sharp up on the port tack. A snow storm with heavy squalls then came on, and she lost sight her. At a quarter to five, on the weather clearing a little, the Eurydice was nowhere to be seen. A punt, with five men in it, was perceived, and the schooner immediately bore down upon them and took them on board. Three of them, including the First Lieutenant (Francis H. Tabor), have since died. The other two, named Benjamin Cuddiford, of Plymouth, and Sydney Fletcher, of Bristol, have recovered, and are now being well taken care of the Cottage Hospital, Bonchurch. Cuddiford states that the ship was caught in a squall and capsized about five miles off Dunnose about four o'clock. He was standing close to Captain Hare when the ship went down, sucking many with it. He was about an hour in the water, and tried to save others who clung to him but in order to save himself he was at last obliged to kick them off. The sad news was immediately telegraphed to Admiral Fanshawe, commander-in-chief, who at once sent steamers to search the vicinity, but they found no trace of any other survivors, and it is feared that all hands, with the exception of Cuddiford and Fletcher, are lost. The ship is lying in about twelve fathoms of water, and at low tide her lower yards are above water. The foretop-gallant mast, and the main royal mast are both gone. The mizen royal is the only sail furled. A party of fifty riggers and several divers proceeded to the spot this morning. The Dromedary is to lay by the wreck ait light ship.

In reference to this sad catastrophe the following was received at the Admiralty last night:–

"J. G. Livesey, Ventnor, the Right Hon. W. H. Smith, M.P., Admiralty, London"

"Her Majesty's training-ship Eurydice capsized in a sudden squall, off Dunnose, at half-past four this afternoon, and went down at once.

"The Emma (schooner), passing, picked up five men, but some have since died.

"Cuddicome (?) first-class boy, and Fletcher saved. Tabor, First Lieutenant, very doubtful. Military Engineer officer drowned.

"Ship was commissioned at Portsmouth Feb. 7, 1877, and ordered to the West Indies. Was now bound for Spithead. Was observed passing Ventnor a few minutes before the catastrophe with all sails set. Snowstorm then came on very suddenly, with ery heavy gusts of wind. Probably no more saved than schooner picked up, as a strong ebb tide was running.

"Sun came out brilliantly directly after squall, but nothing could be seen from shore at Ventnor but few large boxes brought down Channel. Certainly no boat.

"Schooner detained by Capt. Roche, R.N., Inspecting Commander St. Catherine Division Coast Guard, who went on board immediately with Ventnor doctor, and has telegraphed to Admiral at Portsmouth to send steamer round,

"Admiral Fanshawe to Admiralty.

"Have just received the following from Coast Guard, Ventnor : 'Eurydice capsized off Dunnose. Cuddicombe, first-class boy, and Fletcher saved; Tabor, first lieutenant, very doubtful, military engineer officer drowned.' "

"Commander Coast Guard, Ventnor, to Admiralty,

"We have two men alive— Cuddiford, A.8., and Fletcher, first-class boy— and the dead bodies of Lieuteuant Tabor, Colonel Ferrier, R.E., and one able seaman."

The Eurydice was a wooden training ship for ordinary seamen and boys, a vessel of 921 tons. She is thus described in the Navy List :

Eurydice, guns, sixth rate.  
Captain—Marcus A. S. Hare, Feb. 7, 1877.

THE LOSS OF H.M.S. "EURYDICE."

Mr. Goschen asked if the First Lord the Admiralty had any further information in reference to the sad disaster—the loss of the Eurydice– which had spread through the country such deep and universal sorrow. (Hear, hear.)

Mr. Smith was sorry he had not much information beyond what had already appeared in the Press. The disaster was a most mournful one, for the ship was returning after a successful and useful cruise, and the squall by which she was overtaken was so sudden and violent that she went down without notice. Admiral Fanshawe, in a late telegram, reported that everything bad drifted towards the French coast, and no bodies had been recovered. It appeared that when the disaster occurred the men were in the act of shortening sail. The two men recovered were in Bonchurch Cottage Hospital, and it was hoped they would be well enough to be in London, to-morrow. The officers on board the Eurydice were specially selected for efficiency. He expressed the deep sorrow the Admiralty felt at the disaster— the greatest since the loss of the Captain. (Hear, hear.)

FOUNDERING OF H.M.& EURYDICE.

We have received the following sad news from the Admiralty:– "The Admiralty have received the following telegram from Admiral Fanshawe, Commander-In-Chief Portsmouth: — 'Have just received the following from Coastguard, Ventnor:— 'Eurydice capsized off Dunnose. Cuddicome, First-class Boy, and Fletcher saved. Tabor, First Lieutenant, very doubtful. Steamer going Immediately'

"A further telegram states that she capsized in a sudden squall at half-past 4 this (Sunday) afternoon. A subsequent telegram states that Lieutenant Tabor and Colonel Ferrler, Royal Engineers, are dead. The Eurydice was commissioned by Captain Hare, in February, 1877, as a training-ship for second-class Ordinary Seamen, and she was returning to Spithead after a winter’s cruise in the West Indies. The Admiral Commanding-in-Chief at Portsmouth has sent steamers to search the vicinity of the accident, but no further report has been received.  
Admiralty, Sunday, 11 30 p.m.”

VENTNOR, Sunday Evening.  
Her Majesty’s training-ship Eurydice capsized in a sudden squall off Dunnose, Isle of Wight, at half-post 4 o’clock this afternoon, and went down at once. The schooner Emma, which was passing, picked up five men. but some of these have since died. Cuddicombe, a First-class Boy, and Fletcher were saved, and Tabor, the First Lieutenant, but it is very doubtful whether he will recover. The military Engineer officer was drowned. The ship was commissioned at Portsmouth on the of February, 1877, and was ordered to the West Indies. She was now bound for Spithead, and was observed passing Ventnor few minutes before the catastrophe with all sail set. A snowstorm then came on very suddenly with very heavy gusts of wind. Probably no more men have been saved than those picked up by the schooner, as a strong ebb tide was running. The sun came out brilliantly directly after the squall, but nothing could be seen from the shore Ventnor except a few large boxes being swept down the Channel, and certainly no boats. The schooner has been detained by Captain Roche, R.N., Inspecting Commander, St. Catherine's Division of the Coastguard, who went on board immediately with Ventnor doctors, and has telegraphed to the Admiral at Portsmouth to send round a steamer.

Later.  
Lieutenant Tabor is dead, and his body has been brought ashore, so that the only survivors, so far as known, are Benjamin Cuddicombe, of Plymouth, and Sydney Fletcher, of Bristol, First-class Boy, aged 19. Cuddicombe states that the ship capsized in a squall and snowstorm five miles of Dunnose, about 4 o’clock. More than 300 men were on board, all of whom, he believes, are lost except himself and Fletcher. Cuddicombe was among the last on the ship. Captain Hare was near him when the ship went down, suclkng many with it. Cuddicombe and man near him said that vessel was close by when the squall came on, and, therefore, they would be sure to picked up. He was over an hour the water. Being a first-rate swimmer, every one called out to him for help. He tried to assist two or three, but last four clung to him, and he was obliged to kick them off. Was well taken care of the Master of the schooner and Crew. The ship left Bermuda three weeks ago, passed the Lizard yesterday, and expected to anchor at Spithead about 5 o’clock.

These two men are well provided for at the Cottage Hospital, Bonchurch, and are under the care of Dr. Williamson, of Ventnor, who considers them to be doing fairly well.

The Eurydice was a training-ship for Ordinary Seamen, and is officially described as sixth rate. She was under the command of Captain Marcus Hare. Having left Bermuda on her return trip as recently as the 6th inst., she was not expected to reach Portsmouth for some days. Her consorts, the Martin and the Liberty, have arrived—the former at Portsmouth, and the latter at Plymouth.

The following list of Officers board is given in the *Navy List* .—Captain Marcus A. S. Hare. Lieutenants : Francis H. Tabor, Charles Y. Strange, William E. Black, Stanley A. Burney. Staff-Surgeon; James L. Whitney. Paymaster: Frank Pittman. Sub-Lieutenants: the Hon. Edward B. Gifford, Herbert S. Edmonds, Walter S. Smith, Sidney G. Randolph.

THE GALE AND SNOW STORM

During the gale which passed over the metropolis so suddenly on Sunday afternoon, several boats were swamped in the upper part of the Thames and loss of life resulted.

The weather in South Shropshire is intensely cold, and tbe hilly district has been visited with fitful storms of snow. Thee tops of the lofty eminences of the Loag-mynd, the Carodoc Range, and the Clee Hills, are all capped with snow.

During a snowstorm which raged off the Scotch cosst at Stranraer on Sunday the schooner Ellipse, with coals, from Greenock for Isly, was totally lost about ten miles from Stranraer. Two of the crew, by name M'Millan and M'Neill, were drowned.

On Sunday afternoon, while the wind was blowng hard from the north, a schooner, which afterwards proved to be the Heroine, of Dartmouth, bound from Lydney to Fremington with a cargo of coals, was seen running for the harbour at Appledore, in Devon, when sha was caught by some dense snow squalls which completely enveloped her. On their clearing away she was found to have been driven on the South Tail Bank, where she was surrounded by broken water. The Appledore No. 1 life-boat of the National Life-boat Institution was launched with all despatch, and was fortunately enabled to save the crew of the vessel, which is likely to become a total wreck.

The screw-steamer Eagle, of Neath, while making for Hayle Harbour, in Cornwall, on Sunday, during a stroug N.E. wind, grounded on the bar, and the heavy seas breaking over her carried away her screw, rudder, and stern poet. The Oxford University life-boat Isis, belonging to the National Life-boat Institution, and stationed at this place, promptly proceeded to her and remained by her for an hour, until it was considered the lives of the crew were no longer in danger.

On Sunday morning, during a strong wind from the north, a vessel ran ashore on the Goodwin Sands. Tha Broadstairs life-boat of the National Life-boat Institution and tbe Ramsgate Harbour steamer Vulcan and life-boat Bradford proceeded to her assistance, and after some hours' exertion they were successful in getting the disabled vessel off the sands and into harbour. She was the brigantine Florida, of Christiania, bound from Frederikstadt to Granville, with a cargo of coal, and had on board a crew of seven men.

On Sunday evening, during a heavy gale from the north, accompanied by snow showers, the schooner Velocity, of Nefyn, bound there from Silloth, exhibited signals of distress in Porthdinllaen Bay, North Wales, and in response thereto the National life-boat George Moore was launched, and succeeded in rescuing ths crew, whom she landed in safety. This life-boat was placed there about six months since, its expense being defrayed from a fund raised amongst the *employés* of Messrs. Copt stake, Hughes, Crampton, aud Co. (lat. Mtssrs. Copestake, Moore, and Co.), to provide a life-boat to be called the George Moore in memory of their late respected employer, the well-known philanthropist.

THE LOSS OF THE EURYDICE.

From Our Own Correspondent, Ventnor, Monday

Finding that the two poor fellows who had such a narrow escape from the sinking of the ill-fated Government training-ship Eurydice were sufficiently convalescent to admit of an interview, I spent a short time with them in their bed-room this morning, and elicited a few facts from them concerning tha terrible catastrophe. These poor fellows, Benjamin Cuddiford and Sidney Fletcher, did not appear to be very communicative, but thay exhibited no particular studied desire to withhold any facts. Cuddiford, a powerful-looking man, about 35, was second captain on the quarterdeck, and belongs to Plymouth. Fletcher is a youth about 20 years of age, and was qualifying as seaman. From Cuddiford's statement, which was confirmed by Fletcher, it appears that the Eurydice left Bermuda on the 6th instant, having on board ber full complement o officers and men, with about 300 men and boys in training for her Majesty's navy. There were also Colonel Ferrier aud five other officers of the Royal Engineers on board, with Colonel Ferrier's servant. They had a fine voyage homeward, with the exception of one day's rough sea. As they passed Bonchurch and Ventnor shortly after mid-day the vessel was in full sail, and there appeared not the slightest premonitory indication of the awful event. Part of the men and boys were below deck at the time, and some of them were asleep in their berths, having gone off duty at noon. At the moment of the catastrophe they were thrown bodily from their sleeping postures, and as they rushed to the gangways they were met by the sea and carried below with the ill-fated vessel. There were others firmly locked in the cells below deck, and several were in irons for various misdemeanours. There were six of these prisoners on board, being transferred to Portsmouth — four from her Majesty's ship Rover, which was in the company of the Eurydice on the West Indian station, one from the brig Martin, and one from the Bermuda dockyard. After passing Bonchurch the ship was sailing apparently in safety, when a sudden squall from the W.N.W. caught hold of her canvas, and, with the aid of an immense sea which broke upon the port side of the hull, she was quickly thrown on her beam ends. The captain was at his post, and instantly gave orders to take in the lower studding-sail, which Cuddiford, who was on deck at the time, seized hold of and let go, hastening afterwards to the side of the captain at the stern of the vessel. Other men had been ordered aloft, and were in the act of taking in the royals when the ship sank, carrying all hands with her. There were only four guns on board, bnt they were all fast, and did not seem to move from tbe port holes. She was what the seamen call a "stiff"' vessel, and the hands considered her safe, particularly in regard to the unlooked-for casualty of capsizing. When she heeled over a rush was made for the starboard boat, but they were unable to clear her from her davits and she was stove in ; but as to the boat to windward, that was lifted so high in the air aa to be out of all reach, and it was useless to attempt to utilise it. It had been a beautiful day, and the port doors had been unsuspectingly left open, and when the vessel heeled over the sea rushed into these open ports like a torrent, and the hands on deck plunged into the sea as the craft went down. The captain bravely remained on the deck till nearly every man who was on the upper deck had jumped overboard, and so far as the survivors could remember he went down with the ship. Suddenly thrown into the raging sea, the seamen struggled and cried for assistance, but there was none to help. Tha two men who were saved are good swimmers, aad they say they were in the water about an hour. They could see the cliffs as the snowstorm cleared away, and they struggled hard to reach the shore, but all their efforts proved ineffectual. They were on the verge of despair, when, to make bad worse, they saw to their horror an immense sea rushing towards them and threatening speedy destruction. In their last hope they turned upon the coming wave and in terror awaited their fate. As if by a miracle they found themselves again on the surface of the water. After this swell had spent itself, and again looking round, they discovered a short distance away a schooner which had weathered the terrible storm. By this time they were almost exhausted, but they took fresh courage from the sight of the schooner, which was bound for Poole, and raised their hands as a signal of distress. When hauled on board they became unconscious, but recovered before they were landed at Ventnor.

From other sources it seems that the schooner made signals to the shore, while on board they were doing all they could to restore the poor sea-men, having also picked up Colonel Ferrier, Lieutenant Tabor, and an able seaman who has not get been identified, but is supposed to be named Bennett. All were alive when picked up by the schooner— the Emma, of Poole— but the two officers and the unknown seaman had expired before they reached the shore at Ventnor, whither they were taken by a Deal lugger, which had been chartered by the coaatguards and taken off to the Emma by Chief-officer Clark, of the Ventnor station. Lieutenant Tabor was found clinging to a locker which had been washed from the foundered ship.

Cuddiford and Fletcher left Ventnor by the 2.10 train this afternoon for Portsmouth, there to undergo an examination by the Admiral of the Port. The Eurydice is now lying, it is thought, on a ledge, drifted there by the rough sea. She stands with a slight list, but at low water several feet of her upper masts are observable with the topsails furled. During the day two Government tugs have been at the scene of the wreck.

FROM ANOTHER CORRESPONDENT. PORTSMOUTH. MONDAY.

There is as yet very little to add to the sad account of the loss of life in the Eurydice. The two sailors, Cuddiford and Fletcher, who are as yet known to be the only survivors, have been brought to the dockyard and have been seen by the Commander-in-Chief, Admiral Fanshawe, and other officials. Two sets of divers were sent out this morning to the wreck, but up to 7 p.m. there is no information of any bodies having been found, although as in all such cases there are various reports and opinions expressed.

The master of the schooner Emma, who picked up the survivors, states that he was proceeding down Channel, and being below in his berth he was hurriedly called on deck by the mate in charge and told there were signs of a heavy gale coming on. On reaching the deck he immediately gave orders to guard against the evidently impending danger by taking in all the sail he had set. The mate then told the master that a short time previous he saw a man of war ahead, but new she was nowhere to be seen, and on nearing the spot where she was last seen he saw the men he had picked up floating about, but did not see any other bodies. He states that the gale and snowstorm was the most violent he ever witnessased, as it came to its height almost suddennly.

The schoomer and her crew have been detained by order of the Commander-in-Chief, in case the eNvdence of the men should be required at any court of inquiry that may hereafter be hold. The sad calamity has caused a heavy gloom to spread over the place and neighbourhood, where so many of the relatives of the unfortunate officers and crew reside.

Her Majesty sent a telegram to-day to the Commander-in-Chief for all particulars, and to express her grief at the sad occurrence.

PORTSMOUTH, MONDAY EVENING

A steamer has just come in from the scene of the wreck, but no bodies have been found. Divers have been down, but they could not penetrate to the lower deck. All the sails are set. Thy wreck is not more than a mile and a half from the shore.

TELEGRAMS FROM THE QUEEN.

The following telegrem has bean received at Portsea from General Ponsonby at Windsor:-

"The Queen is deeply grieved to hear of the loss of the Eurydice. Her Majesty anxiously asks for further parlculars."

In accordance with the Royal request all available intelligence was transmitted to the Queen.

The following telegram from the Queen to the First Lord of the Admiralty. dated Windsor, 4.5 p.m., was received at the Admiralty is the early part of last evening:—

"The Queen would ask Mr. Smith to intake known her grief at the terrible calamity of the Eurydice, and her heartfelt sympathy with the afflicted parents and relatives."

The subjoined particulars of the deplorable event are gleaned from various sources :—

Captain Somerset, the senior officer at Bermuda, in a letter of the 6th inst., reports that the Eurydice arrived on 25th February from Antigua, and sailed 6th March for Portsmouth. She had on board, besides her own otficera and crew, one ship's corporal, nine marines and time-expired men, six military time-expired men, two naval invalids, and three court-martial prisoners. The names of these men are not yet known.

Captain Hare, who commanded the Euydice, and Lieutenant Tabor, the first lieutenant, were firat-rate seamen and were selected by the late Mr. Ward Hunt especially for their good qualities in this respect. The cruise had been a most successful one.

When the Eurydice, on February 14, parted cornpsny with the training-briga Martin and Liberty, which arrived home last Thursday, the Eurydice was proceeding to Antigua to refit. During the voyage, several ordinary seamen were promoted by Captain Hare to the rank. of A.B.'s.

A telegram from Ventnor on Monday morning says:— "The sudden capsizing of her Majesty's ship Eurydice yesterday afternoon, and the lose of some 313 live, has cast a gloom over our little town, and this morning broke without revealing any speck on the wide expanses of water giving hope of further lives saved. The only two known surivors— Benjamin Cuddiford and Sidney Fletcher—are progressing favourably, and are quite as will as could be expected after such a prolonged immersion on such a wintry day. The masts of the ill-fated frigate are now visible about two miles from shore, off Lucombe. As there was a strong ebb tide at the time of the disaster and a strong north wind blowing no bodies are likely to wash ashore here. The Eurydice passed Ventnor at 3.15 with a heavy press of sail, and this attracted considtrable attention and admiration. Within half an hour from that time the weather, which bad been bright, suddenly changed, and a strong gust having caught the sails caused her at once to capsize and sink. But for the schooner Emma passing at the time nothing would have been known of the disaster, as for fully half an hour every object was obscurod by a blinding snowstorm, and it would have been thought that the ship had gone on safely to Spithead."

At Portsmouth yesterday morning, on the loss of the Eurydice becoming known, a large number of relatives and friends of the men on board flocked to the dockyard to obtain information. Nothing, however, was made known beyond the bare announcement of the disaster posted on the dockyard gates. One of the tugs which started for the scene of the casualty on Sunday night returned yesterday and took out a large party of shipwrights and riggers and the diving apparatus. The crew of the tug report that at low water her lower yards are just visible above water. She appears to have been in full sail when caught in the squall, and the only sail failed, as far as can at present be ascertained, was the main royal. According to competent opinion ths Eurydice was backed sharp upon the port tack when seized by the squall. The foretopgallant mast and the main royal are broken off, andthis may be taken as indicative of the strength and severity of the squall.

A correspondent, telegraphing from Ventnor yesterday morning, says— "It was a sudden squall from land which upset the Eurydice whilst taking in sail. She immediately heeled over on her beam. All the boats were swept away. She was going at the rate of 15 miles an hour. Some men jumped overboard, but nearly all stuck to the ship, and the captain remained till the last. The ship rapidly filled with water, and in a few minutes went down head foremost. Cuddiford thinks that many were killed instantaneously at the time the sheip heeled over. He jumped overboard himself just before the ship went down. Looking around him he could only see about 30 come to the surface, amongst them being the two doctors, who were both swimming. The first lieutenant, Mr. Tabor, and a captain of the Royal Engineers had seized hold of a wash-deck locker. For some time after Cuddiford had taken hold of the buoy he could not see land. He estimates the time they were in the water at about one hour and 20 minutes. Fletcher, the other survivor, hailed him and they were making for the shore when they were picked op by the schooner Emma, whose atention they attracted by raising their hands and shouting out. There were 30 passengers on board, seven members of the ROyal Engineers, six prisoners, one in irons, the others in cells. Fletcher was saved by fortunately picking up a cork life-belt from the ship's life-boat. Benjamin Cuddiford is an able seaman and Sidney Hatcher an ordinary seaman. Fletcher was on the watch below decks. When he found the ship heeling over he rushed on deck, and found the ship's gunwale under water. A violent squall and snowstorm prevailed at the time of the wreck. 1Lieutenant Tabor was picked up alive, but died on the schooner Emma. The captain of Engineers was picked up dead. This narrative is obtained from the survivors this morning."

A telegram from Portstmouth at noon yesterday says: —"The excitement here is intense, and many unfounded rumours are circulatiog. One statement has been spread to the effect that the captain and two midshipmen of the Eurydice had been picked up alive, but no such tidings have been received at the Admiralty offices, and the report is therefere discredited. The admiral and the captain of the Steam Reserve have gone to the wreck, and a despatch-boat has just been sent from the flag-ship with provisions for the working party at the wreck. By all nautical men the Eurydice was looked upon as one of the finest sailing frigates in the service, and the feeling among them is one of universal surprise at such a catastrophe having overtaken her. She was at one time commanded by Admiral Sir George Elliot, who was remarkably well pleased with her. The relatives of the officers and crew continue to  present themselves in large numbers at the Admiralty offices here seeking for Information. In some cases a wife or a mother has been sent to the scene of the disater, so as to be near at hand in case of any others being rescued alive or their remains recovered. Hopes are still entertained that some of the crew may yet be heard of as having been washed ashore elsewhere or picked up in the Channel. The severity of the weather on Sunday, however, renders this theory extremely improbable. The Government steamers continue to cruise round in hopes of gaining some tidings. The inquest on the remains of the four men picked up has not yet been fixed."

The indications are that her sails were not blown away by the squall, and the consequently she was laid on her beam-ends, and it is surmised that the ports being open she immediately filled and sank. The Eurydice being a fine statch ship, it is believed there wil be no difficulty in raising her. She was a fully rigged ship. She was a wooden ship of 921 tons. She is ths described in the Navy List:-

Thursday 28 March 1878

OFF THE ISLE OF WIGHT. 300 OR 400 LIVES LOST.

Her Majesty's training ship Eurydice, returning from a cruise to the West Indies with a crew of young seamen, capsized on Sunday afternoon, about four o'clock, during a heavy snowstorm, and sudden and tremendously heavy squall, about live miles off Dunnose. A schooner picked up five of the crew, but two soon died. and another— Tabor, the first lieutenant, soon followed. The remainder of the officers and crew, said to be between and 300 and 400 in all, were drowned. Dunnose is a headland near the centre of the south-east coast of the Isle of Wight, between Shanklin and Sandown. The two men saved are Benjamin Cuddeford. first-class seaman, of Plymouth, and Sydney Fletcher, a first-class boy, of Bristol, aged 19. Cuddeford was among the last on the ship. Captain Marcus Hare, he says, was near him when the ship went down, sucking many with her. A man near him said a vessel was close by when the squall came up, and, therefore, they would be sure to be picked up. He was over an hour in the water. Being a first-rate swimmer everyone called to him for help. He tried to assist two or three, but at last four clung to him, and he was obliged to kick them off. He was well taken care of by the master of the schooner and the crew. The ship left Bermuda three weeks ago. She passed the Lizard on Sunay, and expected to anchor at Spithead about five o'clock. These two men were well provided for at the Cottage Hospital. Bonchurch, and placed under the care of Dr. Williamson, of Ventuor.

The Eurydice, a sailing vessel of 921 tons burden, was commissioned in Portsmouth in 1877, as a training ship for second-class ordinary seamen, and sent to the Barbadoes station. Most of the unfortunate young men are believed to belong to Portsmouth. Two tugs were sent from Portsmouth as soon as the sad news reached Admiral Fanshawe.

The circumstances are similar in many respects to those attending the loss of the Captain, both ships having turned over and sunk during a gale of wind, all their sail being at the time set. So far as can be ascertained the Eurydice had 368 souls on board at the time, though this is very much a mater of conjecture, as, besides her own offciers and crew, she was bringing home a number of military offciers, supernumeraries, and invalids from the West Indies. Hence considerable uncertainty exists as to the names and numbers of the sufferers. The Eurydice was a wooden sailing, fully-rigged ship of 921 tons displarsimeat, and was at one time considered one the smartest and quickest 26 gun frigates in the service. She was built about 1843. Last year she was converted into a training ship for ordinary seamen at Mr. John White's yard at Cowes, and was completed for sea at Portsmouth Dockyard. oShe was commissioned on the 7th of February, 1877, and finally sailed from Portsmouth on the 13th of November with a crew of about 300 ordinary seamen and the officers named below. All the officers and crew are lost, with the exception of two seamen. Captain Hare had been at one time commander of the St. Vincent, training-ship at Portsmouth, and was selected for the command from his knowledge and experience of young seamen. Lieutenant Tabor was a thoroughly efficient sailor, having had command of the Cruiser in the Mediterranean. The Eurydice was accompanied from Portsmouth by the training brig Martin, and was eventually joined at Madeira by the Liberty from Plymouth. All the vessels were filled with ordinary seamen, whom it was considered necessary to inure to the sea by a long cruise ; and, as they were all draughted from the home training-ships, the distress caused by their loss is spread over the whole country. They were, of course, mostly unmarried men, and in this respect the crew differ from that of the Captain, who were principally able-bodied seamen and petty officers. The Liberty arrived at Portsmouth a few days ago, the Eurydice being detained for the purpose of taking up supernumeraries. Captain Hare, however, informed Lieutenan-Commander Hicks that he expected to be home almost as soon as the Martin.

Cuddeford made the following statement to the Admiralty authorities:–

"At 7 bells on Sunday afternoon, the 24th inst., the watch at a quarter to 4 o'clock was called to take in lower studding-sails. I was on deck to tend the lower tack, and let it go. The captain gave orders to take in the upper sails. The wind was then freshening. The captain ordered the men to come down from aloft, and then to let go the topsail halliards. The gunner's mate let go the topsail halliards, and another man, Bryans, let go the mainsheets. The water was then running over the lee netting on the starboard aide, and washed away the cutter. The foretopmast studding-sail was set. The wind was about a point abaft the port beam. I caught hold of the main trues, fell, and caught hold of the weathernetting, and got on the ship's side. We could see her keel. She righted a little before going down, bringing the mizzen topsail out of the water. She then went gradually over from forward, the greater part of the hands being at the fore part of the ship outside. She then turned over, bringing the port cutter bottom upwards. I and another, Richards, cut the foremost gripe, and then saw the captain standing on the vessel's side near the quarter boat and the two doctors struggling in the water. I swam some distance, keeping over my head a lifebuoy, which I found, and then picked up some piece of wreck, which I gave to some of the men in the water. I then came across the copper punt full of water, five men were in it. The sea capsized the punt, and they all got on the bottom. They asked me if there was any signs of help. I told them the best thing they could do was to keep their spirits up. One of them was just letting go his hold of the punt. I do not know his name. I next saw Mr. Brewer, the boatswain, with a cork lifebelt on. He was struggling strongly. I then saw Fletcher in the water with a cork belt and breaker. I lost sight of him during the snow. About five minutes afterwards the weather cleared up. I saw Fletcher again and we kept together. Then we saw land, but, finding it too rough, we turned our backs to the land and saw a schooner. The schooner bore down on us, sent a boat, and picked up two offciers that I had not previously noticed with a wash-deck locker. A rope's end was thrown to me from the schooner, and I was then picked up. I judge that I was in the water one hour and 20 minutes. The officers picked up were Lieutenant Tabor and a captain of the Royal Engineers who came on board at Bermuda with one corporal, one bombardier, four privates, and a servant of an officer of the Royal Engineers. The ship capsized about 10 minutes to 4. The captain was giving orders at the time, and was carrying out his duty. We rounded on the weather beam, and set the lower studding-sail at 2p.m. The ship was then going 8 1/2 knots. I don't know who was the officer of the watch as the captain was carrying on the duty. The Hon Mr. Giffard went to the wheel to help at the time the water was coming over the lee nettines in consequence of an order being given to put the helm up. There were the following supernumeraries on board:— Three Court-martial prisoners from the Rover; one A. B., a Court-martial prisoner from Bermuda; an ordinary seaman named Parker, who bad been tried by Court-martial (he belonged to the Eurydice) ; and about 12 or 14 Marines, with one sergeant of Marines from Bermuda Dockyard, two invalids from Bermuda Hospital, one ships' corporal from the Argus, one captain's cook from the Argus, one engineer's steward from the Argus, one ship's cook from Bermuda Dockyard, one quartermaster, named Nicholas, from the Rover. I believe some of the maindeck ports were open to let in the air to the maindeck mess. I don't think the hands were turned up; there was hardly time for that. I saw most of the men forward take off their clothes and jump off before I lost sight of them in the squall. When the snow cleared up the ship was gone down."

THE INQUEST 

Was opened ar the Queen's Hotel, the Esplanade, Ventnor, at one o'clock yesterday, by ? Blake, Esq., coroner for the Isle Wight, and a jury of which  W. Mew Judd was foreman. —The inquest was on the bodies of Lieut. Franics Hope Tabor, Capt. Louis Ferrier, and – Bennett.

The Coroner said that before opening he must express his deep concoern— in which he was sure they all shared, and every one who had heard of the sad occurrence which had called them together— which had resulted in the loss of a large number of valuable lives, when they were really almost in reach and sight of their destination. It was a very important eqnquiry. Although they were only nominally inquiring into the deaths of three persons, a hundred times that number had met their deaths from the same cause, and he was quite sure they would give this matter their meet serious attention, and he hoped the evidence would be such as to enable them to arrive at a satisfactory reason for this sad disaster.

After viewing the bodies the jury adjourned to the Royal Hotel.

Robt. Montague Tabor,of Carshalton, Surrey, deposed that he had seen the bodies. One was that of his brother—Francis Hope Tabor, a lieutenant in the navy. Last saw him alive five or six months ago, in Kent. He went to the West Indies, and was on his way home from Bermuda in the Eurydice. He expected him daily. Thought he would have been 30 in July.

Benjamin Cuddeford deposed that he was an able seaman. l'he bodies viewed were those of Lieut. Tabor, a man named Bennett, and a Captain of the Royal Engineers [Captain Ferrier] who took a passage home in the ship. Bennett was captain of the quarter deck. The Eurydice was a wooden sailing ship-4 guns. One trip before this she was employed as a training ship, and had been 13 months' in commission. Lately she had been all round the West India Islands, witness being aboard her. Her captain was Capt. Marcus Hare. They left Bermuda on the 6th March for Portsmoutb. There were over 300 persons aboard, including supernumeraries. The greater part of the crew were ordinary seamen. There were about 30 ship's company—attached to the ship. On Sunday they were about two hours' sail from Spithead just before 2 p.m.—off the Isle of Wight. They set the lower studdingsail. They had all plain sail set before--all except the topgallant studdingsails. The weather was then very fine. There was just a moderate breeze, just abaft the beam. Between 3.30 and 4 o'clock the captain called the port watch to take in the lower studdingsal. The wind was coming on. Ihe sail was taken in. Then the Captain gave orders for the Royal yardmen aloft to take in the Royals. They were not taken in. The captain ordered the men down at once, and sail let go the mainsheet and topsail halyards. That was for the men's safety —the squad just caught them then. He believed the royals were lowered but not furled. The Captain gave orders to let go the maintopsail halyard and main sheet. That was done. The ship was pretty near on her beam ends. Heard the captain say "If you can't let it go cut it." The men on the lee were up to their waist in water then. He expected it must have been the foresheet. Witness was on the quarter deck at the time. He then crawled up the quarter deck netting over the ship's side, and saw all the sails in the water. He got up to get on the weather side of the ship. He could then see the ship's keel, and her sails were in the water. She righted a few feet, and he saw her mizzen topsail come out of the water. Then he looked forward and saw the ship sinking from forward taking a lot of men with her who were outside the ship. The water gradually increased aft, and just as it got in a line with the mainmast she turned right over, and the port cutter was bottom upwards. Ihe ship's keel was right out of water. He stuck to the ship. The captain gave orders to try and get the port cutter clear. He and another man went, and they got one gripe clear by cutting it with a knife. Then the water encroached. The captain was just behind him at the side of the ship. Richards, who was assisting him (witness), was swept away, and he saw him no more. The cutter was not got clear. He jumped overboard and passed the two doctors drowning, but could not give them any assistance. Many others were in the water then. Witness swam to a round life buoy, and took some pieces of wreck— wood and spars— going to the assistance of others. The captain was still on the vessel when witness jumped over, and the vessel went down almost immediately afterwards. He saw six men on the bottom of a boat. They asked if there was any hopes, and he said the best thing was to keep their spirits up. One let go with the cold. Of those on the bottom of the boat were Mason, Martin, another cook's mate being brought home. The others were ordinary seamen ; he didn't know their names. He saw Mr. Brewer, boatswain, with a lifebelt. He believed the cook's mate had been left behind from the Tamar. Fletcher was close to him, and when the mist cleared they saw land and made for it till they were picked up. Thought he was swimming about an hour and 20 minutes. Fletcher, an ordinary seaman, was also picked up by the schooner. He (witness) caught hold of the rope's end they chucked at him, but turned dizzy afterwards.— A violent snowstorm came on. They were not tacking at the time. The squall came on between 3.30 and 4. They could not see that the storm was coming on: he could not see—he was at work. He didn't see land at all—he didn't go above the netting to see—that was about 2ft above his head. The ports were open on each side. The sub. lieutenant, the Hon. – Gifford, went to assist at the wheel— five men were at the wheel, and the sub-lieutenant at the weather wheel. The helm was put up after they tried to take in the Royal. They did their best to put the helm up —couldn't say whether they did or not. The ports were 4 or 5ft. above the water when the ship was on even keel. The guns did not shift. There was one watch below deck— about 150, and all the supernumeraries— when the first order was given to shorten sail. Some were lying down asleep, and some writing. She had 10 ports and two small ones— all on the upper deck. When the first order was given to shorten sail no order was given to those below —it was not an order to all hands. 150 in the watch on deck was sufficient for shortening sail. When the squall commenced—when the captain saw it coming, he gave the order to shorten sail. Witness experienced most snow in the water than he did before. The officer of the watch was Sub-Lieut. Randolph. He was forward assisting in taking in the lower studdingsail.

By Mr. Tabor: The captain gave the order to set the lower studdingsail.

By others: We run in the weather braces, then set the lower studdingsail. The captain said heave the log, and the reply was 8 knots. That was about 2 o'clock. The main deck being very close, they had the ports open. It was quite usual on such an afternoon as Sunday afternoon, to have the porta open. Didn't see Capt. Hare after he (witness) jumped over. The ship went down about five minutes after she was on her beam ends. There was no time to lower boats—the lower starboard boat was swamped away. The galley was smashed. On Sunday the rule is to pipe down. Saw the captain on deck before it began to look dirty. There was a life buoy on each side the bridle, and one on each bow of the launch, forward, and one right astern. There were only five on deck. There were about twelve life belts. These were in one of the launches, having been moved the day before for painting.

By Mr. Harvey (representing the Admiralty): Directly the captain observed the squall coming, he immediately ordered the taking in of the lower studdingsail— the largest sail in the ship. This was done. The men were in the act of lowering the Royals, when the captain gave the order, Let go the maintopsail halyards and main sheet. In the act of going up, and before doing this, they were ordered down. He supposed the captain was afraid the top?allantmast and royal mast would be carried away. He supposed it was for their safety. There were two cutters—port and starboard. It took 10 to man one, and 12 another, besides coxswains. There would be a life belt for each man in each cutter. The rule was to keep one life belt for each cutter.Three life belts were packed up. The squall came all of a sudden, and she went on her beam ends immediately. It was a sudden gust— almost say it gave no warning. As one of the ship's company, he didn't expect that any such thing would take place. He had been on her 13 months. It was very fine weather just before —nice steady breeze. He thought everything was done that could be done, both to save the vessel and the men's lives. She behaved very well in a gale is the Bay of Biscay going out. All the time witness wait on deck, the Capain and Lieut. Tabor were there. The Engineer Captain was there too. Considered the captain and officers thorough seamen. Had been 21 years in the navy. During that time he sever saw a squall come so quickly. Sundays was a quiet day, and Thursday afternoons was for mending clothes— if fine weather. Thought 150 hands enough to save the vessel, if anything more could have been done. There was no time to do anything. If she had been braced sharp up, it would have taken all hands. If the whole company had been on deck, they would have been in one another's way. Didn't think the least blame attached to any of the officers.

By jurors: When thrown on her beam ends, he thought only a few would have any chance of getting up on deck. When the main sheet was let go, and topsail halyards, it had no effect.

Captain George Henry Ferrier deposed that he belonged to the 105th Light Infantry, now quartered at Colchester. He recognised one of the bodies as that of his brother, Captain Louis John George Ferrier, quartered in Bermuda. He appeared to have come home on leave in the Eurydice. Had not heard that he was coming home. Didn't know whether he had any duty aboard. He was now in his 38th year.

Sydney Fletcher deposed that he was 19 years of age. He was a first-class ordinary seaman aboard the Eurydice. He came in her from Bermuda, having been aboard six months. Last Sunday afternoon he was below between 12 and 4. He was getting his tea to come on at eight bells, when he heard a rush of water on the main deck—in through the ports. She had been going very steady. Just before he heard the water, he found she gave a lurch. He lowered the half port and ran on deck. The water was coming in over her lee netting, and he assisted another man in overhauling the foretopsail halyards. He got over the weather netting, and walked on the ship's side —right aft on the quarter. She was right on her side— he walked below her ports. As soon as he got aft he saw the keel of the ship right out of water. It was blowing hard and snowing, and the sea was breaking right over the ship. He believed the main yard touched the water. Saw the captain standing on the quarter— giving orders. They could not cut the after gripe of the cutter, as it was too late— she was under water. He picked up a life belt, and got away from the ship about 30 yards. She was then nearly under water. The captain was on the side, and Mr. Edmunds, sub-lieutenant, took off his coat and jumped over. Didn't see him after. Saw Mr. Tabor with no cap on. Saw him on a wash-deck locker in the sea. Witness was saved by a life belt, which fell out of one of the cutters. When he saw a schooner yards off he felt so full of joy he didn't know what to do. Bennett had been floating by him. Was in the water an hour and twenty minutes before he was picked up. Then he was insensible. Before the ship lurched he had not noticed the wind blowing harder. His mess was right against the fore hatchway. Didn't think that of the whole watch more than two besides himself got up. Many tried to do so—he heard them making a row, crying and screaming. He was close to the hatchway, and that was how he escaped. He saw Mr. Brewer in the water. Didn't see a great many others. Couldn't say how long the snow storm lasted. It snowed when he jumped off. He got within about half a mile of and then saw the schooner. Should think there were 26 or 38 life belts aboard. The greater part were kept in the pinnaces—boomboat. On ordinary occasions the belts could be easily got at—when the ship was sailing.

By Jurors: Did not see the ship go down. Belioved there was only one man below in irons. Water was partly her ballast.

By the Coroner: This water, being consumed during the voyage, would become lighter towards the close. Could not say what water was left on Sunday. Neither stores nor guns had shifted.

By Mr. Tabor: When he got on deck all was confusion. Lieut. Tabor was in his shirt sleeves. Didn't know whether he was mistaken, as he was picked up with his uniform coat on—he might have been.

By Mr. Harvey : The heeling over and the rushing in of water were instantaneous. lie heard the captain giving the orders, and the men would have got out the cutter if they could. It had been fine up to the very minute, and they were sailing along as they had been all day. Didn't know what the ballast of the ship really consisted of. He knew some ballast was iron. He always understood that the water was taken in for ballast as well as for drink. He didn't understand this as regarded every ship. He had been told on board that water was partly her ballast. Was not sure she had iron ballast. He said partly water, meaning the other part stores. Had never been down to see. Didn't know anything about her ballast —only water. He overhauled the halyards for about two minutes before he got up and out on the side. Thought the ship went down in 7 or 8 minutes after she was struck. All had a chance of getting the life belts in the pinnace —not after she heeled over.

By a Juror: The captain's order was as the port cutter. Could not see the other.

Cuddleford (recalled) by Jurors, said the Eurydice had proper ballast for her tonnage– the lower tier of tanks was never disturbed. She was more lively when they ran rather short. If she gave a cant she would throw you off your legs. Never heard during the voyage that any ballast had shifted. If it had shifted, hands would have had to put it right. She went down with her masts on one side—under water. The mizzenmast showed out of water. There was no chance getting to it.—Didn't know the state of the barometer. Had there been a sudden change by 8 in the morning he should have heard.

William Langworthy Jenkin deposed that he was master the schooner "Emma " of Padstow. On Sunday he was proceeding from Newcastle to Poole. lie encountered a sudden squall about ten minutes past four. He was off Dunnose. Yes he had warning. It looked rather bad to windward before the squall came on. He hauled down the flying jibs, maintopmast staysail, gaff topsail, lowered the mainsail away, the gallant and topsail halyards, boom jib and fore staysail. He afterwards lowered the foresail down. They had only the standing jib set properly. They did it during the squall, which he supposed lasted half-an-hour. Supposed he was four or five miles from land when the squall took them. He saw it approaching. It rose very black. There was a fall of snow too. Didn't see the Eurydice before she went down. After the snow cleared away he saw something floating on the water. He sent a man in the rigging to see what it was. Another man reported he fancied he saw a man in the water. He set the mainsail &c., and went right towards what was floating. They heard cries in the water. They found five men in the water- well on for a quarter of a mile apart from one another. They were all insensible when on deck and very much exhausted. The five were Cuddeford and Fletcher and the three bodies viewed. He got them in the cabin, and stripped them and rubbed them and then came on to Ventner. Should think it was three or four miles from land where he picked them up. They would not take any stimulant. Cuddeford and Fletcher had some coffee. The others could not take anything. A boat came off and he sent ashore for a doctor, and two came. One man was dead when picked up—Bennett. Lieut. Tabor had his uniform on. Two others died aboard. Thought it was only a boat's crew when he picked up the men. Had not seen the Eurydice. His schooner was 137 tons register. The crew was six hands all told. He was laden with coals— light cargo. The wind was W.N.W., should think a vessel 4 or 5 miles from shore would have a better chance of seeing it than one a mile or mile and a-half. He didn't make much preparation till the squall struck. He had no stimulants aboard. Those who died were too far gone to take it if they could have had it.

By Jurors: Saw a barque after the squall. Only saw the five men in the water—no wreckage. The tide was running strongly to the westward. There was no sign of the Eurydice. They couldn't see any more. They didn't sail about. Three had belts on, one a lifebuoy and another a box. Couldn't see the length of the vessel when the snow fell. It took him 30 minutes to take his sails in and it was pretty well over then. They didn't take in any sail till they felt the first weight of the wind. He didn't think it was going to be near so heavy. Had often experienced a stronger squall—perhaps not a more sudden one. A squall might strike with different force and effect on two objects within half a mile of each other.

James Mann Williamson deposed that he was a Doctor of Medicine. On Sunday afternoon he went aboard the schooner. He found three persons in the cabin. Coddeford was half dressed. He was sensible, but apparently suffering from shock, and the other two were apparently dead. Dr. Martin arrived there before, and had been using every means to restore animation in Lieut. Tabor. He attempted to restore animation to the body of as. Ferrier. Did not discover any signs of life. - Dr. Martin thought Lieut. Tabor's head pulsated very slightly, but witness could not feel that. Bennett was dead. He believed all died from drowning. Froth exuded from Mr. Tabor's mouth.

George Parkinson, able seaman, deposed that he was aboard the schooner on Sunday afternoon. He saw the Eurydice before the storm came on—about ten minutes before. She was going up, and they down channel. All the sail was on the Eurydice so far as he could see. When he first saw her, he didn't consider she had too much sail for her safety. After the squall came on, he could not see anything– and he never saw the ship again :didnlt look for her. He saw it coming up black but didn't think it was going to be anything, as it was so long coming. Never saw anything so heavy, after being so long rising. There was only a moderate breeze while he saw the Eurydice. She was about a mile from land. Witness' vessel was four or five. They didn't lower sails till the squall struck.

By Mr. Harvey : He was surprised to hear of the loss of the Eurydice, though he was in the same squall. Had experienced a deal heavier ones. Had seen a squall act more on one vessel than another, when near— had seen one dismantled and not the other. Looking at the weather before the squall, he didn't think the Eurydice had too much canvas. The squall would strike the Eurydice first.

Sgt. Ransom produced the watch which be received from Dr. Martin, who attended Capt. Ferrier. It stopped at eight minutes to four.

Mr. E. J. Harvey (who is the Admiralty Law Agent for Portsmouth) called John Flynn, a commissiosed boatman in the Coastguard, of Ventnor, who produced photographs of a storm which passed over Cowes a year or two ago. The "Globe" was destroyed, and the next house escaped. He produced a photograph to show that it had cut like a knige thriugh some trees in a Copse near Cowes. It showed that a squall at sea would strike one vessel and not another—he had seen that himself. In the Chinese seas he had seen junks blow over, and others not touched.

The Coroner (the above being all the evidence) then summed up the several depositions to the jury –reminding them of the most important points. He said he did not think it necessary to offer many observations, the facts were so short and simple. It seldom happened that in a disaster of this magnitude the facts were so simple and clear. It was not a case of collision where there might be a conflict of evidence as to the cause at the collision, as to whether it it might have been occasioned by want of a sufficient look-out or observation of the rules of the road of the sea, or any similar cause. It was not a case of a vessel striking on a rock, which might or might not be due to any want of care or skill on the part of the person navigating the vessel The question in this case was whether the parties responsible for the safety of this vessel did observe or did not observe that care, caution, and skill, which it was imperative upon them to exercise upon the occasion. It seemed to him that the questions for them to consider were— was the capsizong of this unfortunate ship owing either to her carrying too much sail, and if not whether there was sufficient promptitude on the part of the commander in lowering the sails when he saw that a storm was upon him. Another question which bad been incidentally mentioned, was whether it might have been due in any measure to any want of sufficient ballast. There did not appear to be anything to suggest that there was any danger in the sails which the ship was carrying before she was struck. Cuddeford said the weather was fine and there was a moderate breeze, but be was not on deck to observe whether a storm was approaching, or not. The seaman of the Emma didn't observe anything dangerous or unusal  in the quantity of sail. The next question was— did the Captain use all promptitude and care in giving orders, and were those orders obeyed as far as they could be in taking down the sails. If they believed the evidenee, and there was no reason to doubt it, the Captain did exercise care and promptitude, and remained on the vessel till she went down. If so, there would be no blame attaching to any person.– After alluding to the question of ballast, the Coroner said the Eurydice being much nearer the shore, her captain would not be likely to observe the storm coming so soon as the master of the schooner. He thought the jury could only arrive at the conclusion that it was an accidental circumstance.

The Jury retired and were absent nearly an hour. On their return, the foreman announced that they unanimously found "that Louis J. C. Ferrier, Francis Hope Tabor, and – Bennett, were accidentally drowned, owing to the capsizing of H.M.S. Eurydice, by a sudden squall off Dunnose on Sunday the 24th inst., and the Jury consider from the evidence adduced, that no blame whatever can be attached to the captain, officers, or men of the ship.

There is something of a personal sorrow which must affect every Englishman when he reads a narrative of this kind. We are all proud of the quality of our seamen, and of the courage with which they expose themselves to a life of constant peril. We cannot but mourn over the untimely loss of so many brave and promising fellows. The disaster is intensified in poignancy by the circumstances under which it happaned. Death of one's native land, after a long separation from near and dear friends, is a terrible thing. The joyous hope, the buoyant expectation, the thrill of delight with which the shores of Old England fill the home-coming sailors are changed into the wild cry of despair and wail of drowning men. On such a picture we have no morbid fancy for dwelling. It will haunt, during these coming weeks, many an English home. In scores of cottages hearts have beat high with hope, the simple preparations of affection have been made, and parents have counted the hours till they should clasp their stalwart sailor-lads in their arms once more. And now the desolation of death has turned their joy into a terrible sorrow. The cruel, merciless sea has robbed them of the bright boys of whom they were so proud. England shares their sorrow. If it be any consolation to the bereaved relatives of those who have gone down in the Eurydice, they may be sure that not an English heart beats but does not sympathise with them in their great sorrow, and deeply deplore the calamity which has robbed the country of more than 300 of her brave defenders.

FOUNDERING OF THE "EURYDICE" IN SANDOWN BAY.

Men stood aghast, as well they might, to hear  
The dreadful news last Monday morning brought:  
A gallant ship, with past three hundred souls,  
Hallf founded in the Bay on Sunday eve !  
So awful sudden this catastrophe  
That not a token reached tne dwellers by  
To tell them hundreds of their fellow men  
Were, within eye-ken, struggling for their lives. 
No sadder tale has ever yet been told  
Or shipwreck's horror, sudden aud complete : —  
A noble frigate, gaily homeward bound,  
All her full press of suow-white canvas set,  
In swan-like state came sailing past our Bay.  
Over the waves majestic'ly she glides,  
Replete with life aud lignt —a nation's pride—  
An emblem of our rule upon the sea —  
A sight to charm the eye and stir the pulse.  
Sudden as ligutning's strike, from Culver's brow  
Swoops tne fierce squall, 'midst blinding sleet and snow,  
And, like a tiger springing on its prey,  
Bore down that gallant vessel to her doom.  
One moment saw her proudly ride thi waves  
Exultant in her beauty aud her strength ;  
The next, behind that curtain-cloud of storm.  
Hopelessly stricken, crushed, and settling down.  
So sank ihe Eurydice — as smart a craft  
As ever bore our meteor flag aloft.

Home from the West Indies she had sped,  
With wide-spread wings, aud many a favouring gale,  
Till England's longed-for shores were reached at last :  
Then, up the Channel, proud of har past fame,  
The brave old frigate pressed upon her way,  
With tensioned canvas spread ; to gain her port  
She rounds the Wight, and there before her lies  
The hoped-for haven— Portsmouth — full in sight,  
With home aud kindling holding welcome out,  
Almost within the sea-worn wauderor's grasp.  
God! wnat a moment that to be struck down ;  
To change home's welcome for a watery grave ;  
To strew three hundred corses on the shore  
Where stalwart tonus, full of high hope and life,  
Were looked for by thair kindred and their Queen.

The news has cast a grief-cloud o'er the land,  
Dark'ning alike the palace aud the cot ;  
And words of heartfelt sympathy well forth  
For those thus lost to us, aud those bereaved.  
In meek submission to the Divine will  
We gather now our dead, who nobly died  
In full discharge of duty — even so,  
As though they fell in battle, face to face  
With England's direst foe. Above their grave  
The sea lies calm, aud golden-tinted clouds  
Look down witn a mild pity on the spot  
Where lies tne Eurydice ahd her brave crew.

Thomas Maton. Sandown, March 26th, 1878.

THE LOSS OF THE "EURYDICE"
SUNDAY, MARCH 25, 1878.

O'er the calm bosom of the treacherous sea,  
The bright aun "hieing on each snowy Bail,  
Onward she speeds, though shortly doomed to ba  
A victim to th_9 fury of ihe gale.  
Oae gust of wiad, -ne blinding cloud of snow  
T*iat cast a gloom around her like the night,  
Oae bitter cry of agony and w e,  
Aud she had .unit for ever from our sight.  
Fond hearts were waiting for her quiok return,  
Fond eyea were gazing fir across the main ;  
L ng may they watch, and loag th <_ _ hearts may yearn,  
For those on earth chey ac er wdl «cc again I  
Hearths will be desolate which were not so ;  
Loud the sad cry is heard >>n every eide,  
And mourners weep in bitterness of woe  
For those who in their country's service died.  
All England feels for those who now are left,  
Wtd wad and fatherless, their loss to mourn ;  
Of all their lived unes suddenly bereft  
By fearful violence ..f tne pissing storm !  
Shine down, O sun, with thy bright cheering face,  
The world riils on as it has dove b-jfore ;  
Grant tho.e who died have found iheir resting pluce  
Above, where troubles shall be known nu mure.

THE INQUEST.

The inquest upon the bodies of Lieutenant Francis Hope Tabor, Captain Louis Ferrier, R E , and David Bennett, ordinary seaman, was held •>n Tuesday af- ternoon by F. Blake, Ksq. coroner, who commenced the proceedings ut the Qu en*. Hotel, Esplanade, Venrnor. The bodies were in a little o ithou-e near the hotel, and had already been coffined That of Captain Ferrier especially bore a calm and peaceful expression, betoken ng that death had be n su Iden and painless, i'he white cloths with which they had been covered were sprinkled with beautiful fiowers. As .-oon as the Coroner, jury, and repre- sentatives of the Pre-*s had assembled at the Queen's Hotel it vvas at onco perceive 1 that tbe room placed at. their d sposal was a great deal too small, aui the Coron<-r asked if a larger room could not • c pro- cured. Tt.e Freeinas ns' Tavern was at first sug- gested, but eventually the proprietor of the Royal Hotel off r>-d the use of a lar_r r room there, and after the jury, of whom Mr. W. M Judd was fore- man, had been sworn aud had viewed the body, they aujourned to the Royal Hotel In opening the pro- ceedings, The Coroner said he could not forbear expressing his de. p concern, which he was sure everybody must share, at the cav e which had ea ie.l them together — au aoei'lent which had resulted in the loss of so many valuable hv-s when th-y had aim rst arrived afc their de-tination. This was a most important enquiry, for, though the present mqu-st was nomi .ally only as to the dea hof hre • persons, a hundred tim s that number hid di d froai the same accident. He aske . them to giv.- ttii-- evidence th.ir b.-st attention. The first wi'ness c died was, Robert Monr. igue Tabor, who deposel — I liv - at Carshortou, Surrey I ha>e ,-c. n h* bo ie- which have b eu viewed by the jury, and identify one or ih in as that ol m* brother, Fra icis -lope Tab >r, a lieut- n mr. in the Navy I la.se -aw him abve about five or six mouths ago, in iv. nt. He had anoe been to the Wesr, Indies He was first lieuten- ant on board the Eurydice, and was couiinvf home iv .er. We were exp. eting hnn daily. I think he would have b:-en 3D in July. Benjamin Cuddifol'd deposed -I am an able sea- man. 1 h.ve seen the bodu s a hieh have been v. ewed hy the coroner .nd jury, and identify ihem a.s th ise oi Lieut. Tabor, a man uame I Beuuett (I .lout know his Chris! ian name), am- the otner is a captain iv the Engineers, who took a passage in the snip. I kuew him by signt, but did not ku >w his n tme. Lieut. Tabor was first lieu euant on hoard rhe Euy- dice, and L w s ible seaman on board the sames dp. Bennett, was captain of the quarter deck. Th.* cap- tain in the Englu-ers had only taken a pas-.a^e on board, aud was not doing duty. The Eury lice was a woo ien sailing ship, and had been employed as a training .-hip, and had been li months in eonvnis- .uou. Stie had laiely beeu over to ihe W.-st India Islands. I had been on Ooard h r all the 13 mouths, ohe w.t-- ?? a out the VVest India Islands all the wiuter L cut Tabor was ■■.omiuaudiug oificer. Capt. Hare was on board. We \< ft Bermuda on i.tie ti h of March, tor Port -mouth. VVe h id over oUU oiiicers nnd men ou bo ird 1 hat included -Uper- numaries. I cauuot say for certain exact lv how mauy there were.

On Sunday, about 2 o'clock in ttie nfternoon, the snip wa** otf ttie isle of Wight, we net the lower tun- sail. We had all piaiu salts ser. betore lhat. We had all sails set excep. Copgallaut stun-ad. The weather was tfieu very rin>, aui there was a mode- rate wiud just abaft the beam. Between halt-past 3 aud 4 o'clock they called th • lower waton to ta_:e iv the lower stuu-ail, the weather looking diry io wind var.t. It was jus c .ining «.n to blow tnen. lhe r-ail was taken in, a .d tnen orders were . to take in the royals. The squill caught us bef ■_.-•> the royals were taken in, auu ihe captain ordered the men down for theirown safety. The royals were then lowered, but noe furled. Then the captain gave orders to let go the maintopsail halyards and main sheet. That was done, and the next order the captain gave wa-, "If you cau't let it go, cv' it " Tne .-hip was tnen on her beam ends, aud the water up to tie men's waists, but I don't know ro what the ord r referred. I was on the quarter deck netting. 1 got tnere to get ou the Weather sid . of the .hip. 1 could theu see her keel, and her sails were in the water. "She rignte 1 a^.in a few feet, aud I saw her mizentoosail come out of the w tier. 1 then *uw the ship sinking from forwards, takiug down wi h her a bjdy of men which wee on her bottom. Ttie water began to in- crease afc, and just as the water got abre tst of the mainmast the snip turned right over, and her keel was out of waier Ist uck to tbe snip. Ttie captain gave orders toget the cutter clear, aud we had got .me rope clear by cut ing ie with a knife, but the Water encroached upon us.

We couid uot see that it was coming on. I did nor see any laud any time all the afternoon. I did not go above the n ttmg to -cc it. My work kept me from seeing anything else. The rop s I had to attend to were close to the deck. The p .rts were op n. The squall caught us from the same direction as vve were gom_r They tried to put up the helm. There were five mn ac the helm Tne Hon Gilford was there I can't say whether th-y did pue it up. Tne ports, when the ship was on au even keel, were about sft! above t.ie w iter.

It was a sudden gust which sent the ship over. It came without giving any warning. As one of the --hip's company, I did not expect that any such thing would take place. Capt George Henry Ferrier, of the ?? Light Infantry, -tari-m d at Colchester, identified one of the bodies .e»->n by the • 'oroner and Jury tis tbat of his late brother, Capt.

CAPSIZING OF THE EURYDICE. LIVES LOST

reg-et have to record that during thai sudden and severe snowstorm which occurred Sunalty S&ernoon her Majesty's ship Eurydioe, Admiralty training ship for second-class seamen, capsized off Dunnoee* a headland near tire the south'ease uoaslrof the-lakr of Wight. A schooner picked five of tho crew*; but'three of died subsequently, one them being Tabor, tfie ftrstTieutenant, who was brought ashore at Ventnori The only survivors are Benjamin Cuddiford, of Plymouth, and Sydney Fletcher, of Bristol, first-class boy, aged! 19. These two men are well provided for. at the Cottage Hospital, Bonchurch. The Eurydice was commissioned in Portsmouth 1877, and sent to the Bar Dadoes station. YmTTHoir, Monday Night. There is now no doubl tbai during the sudden squall passed over the British Isles on Sunday aftf rnopn one* the most terrible disasters that haa ever befallen the English navy occurred off the Jsle oi Wight, resulting tiie almost immediate foundering of well-found man-of-war, and the drowning out, souls who' were on board her. The Eurydicc, though an obi fashioned - wooden ate, has gone the bottom precisely the same way the newly designed turret ship did, that is:7-She has been capsized owing to the press of canvas she was carrying, when suddenly struck squall, and sad to relate, the number who have perished with her is not far short of the total lost off the coast of Spain in Sept., IS7O. The cc was old sailing frigate, and her day was regarded as a crack vessel. had been laying up Portsmouth for years until 1875 the Admiralty, the suggestion of the late Mr, Ward Hunt, determined to utilise her a seagoing training ship for ordinary seamen. This course, gave very general satisfaction to t/.e service, it being felt that, some more extended knowledge of working a big ship sea was needed for our young Bailors than they could possibly obtain by cruising about the Channel the M'the'five, brigs hitherto employed for that . purpose. Accordingly in February, 1877, the Eurydice wee commissioned Portsmouth by . Captain Marous A. S. Hare, having a complement of 230 hands, by far the larger proportion being ordinary seamen of the second-class. For this she cruised about the Channel. Captain Hare fulfilling his special duty of instruction m the most satisfactory manner, and justifying 'bis selection for tuch command special knowledge of sailing a ship. This was especially illustrated last summer, when he brought his. vessel under sail from Plymouth Sound right into the Hamoaze, a feat which to that time bad not been attempted for many years. the commencement of the last winter, the Admiralty ordered the Eurydice to proceed on a winter cruise to the West Indies, and she did so, being accompanied two brigs, also manned by ordinary seamen. She .s returning from that cruise on Sunday, and was within an hour's sail of Spithead, when the terrible cacastrophe chronioled below befel her. The Eurydioe left Bermuda on the 6th inst., having on board, in addition to her own crew, some time-expired men both from the army and navy, and some prisoners, bringing the total number on board to 330. She bad very fair passage all the way-home, passing the Lizard on Sunday morning, and being off the Isle of Wight soon .after three the afternoon of that day. that timo the wind w&a light and the sea smooth, although noon there had been fresh breeze blowing. The ship had all plain sails set, with studding Bails the port side; the wind from the southwest, and being on the port quarter. Thus it will be. seen that she wasjmder heavy press of canvas, though those who saw her say that it was not too much, considering the force of the wind that time. 

THE MOMENT OF THE DISASTER.

From what could be gathered this morning from the two survivors, prior to their being despatched to Portsmouth see the Commanderin-Chief, seems that, 3.30 p.m., they, common with many their comrades, were on the lower deck having tea. About quarter to four, Cuddiford says he heard the boat- mate pipe hands to shorten sail, and and others at once proceeded on deck to execute the order. On getting up the ladder, however, found that the ship had been struck by a tremendous squall, which had first come from the north-west, and that she was heeling over very fast on the starboard side. Captain Hare was the bridge giving instructions for shortening the sail, but this was never actually done, as the men on deck, seeing that the ship was rapidly turning over, proceeded to jump from her side into the sea. Cuddiford and Fletcher, tho two survivors, both didthie, and they attribute their being rescued alive to their knowledge of 3wimming. Cuddiford says that three or four minutes elapsed between the pipe to shorten sail and the ship going down, and an indication of the time of the vessel foundering is given by the watch found on the body of Captain Ferrier, R.E., which stopped precisely at eight minutes four. FIRST TIDINGS OF THE CATASTROPHE. The first tidings of the disaster were communicated to the shore the captain of the schooner Emma, of Padstow. He anchored his vessel off the coastguard station at Ventnor, and hoisted Bignal of distress, upon which the inspecting officer of coastguards. Commander Roche, and the chief officer proceeded to her a boat. On learning the true nature of things, Commander Roche despatched some of his men for medical assistance, and, with others, tried to restore animation to the five persons who had been rescued. Two surgeons of Ventnor were very soon in attendance, but all efforts to restore life failed, except in the oaseof Cuddiford and Fletcher* who, when they could be removed! were taken on shore and treated the Cottage Hospital. The bodies were removed to the shore, and placed in shed near the Esplanade. NARRATIVE OF THE CAPTAIN OF THE EMMA. The captain of the schooner Emma afforded the following information: —He stated that he was on voyage from Padstow to Poole ballast, and that he was proceeding Channel on Sunday afternoon, when observed the Eurydice with all anil set. She was much nearer the land than his vessel. He observed that the wind was shifting about and the weather looking threatening, consequently he shortened sail. The squall was accompanied by a very heavy fall of snow, and when this had cleared away be looked around and could see no signs of tho Eurydice. He continued on his course when suddenly he heard someone shouting for assistance. He once lowered a boat, which succeeded in picking five persons and bringing them on board the schooner. He cruised about the spot for some time, but being unable to observe any one else, he then stood in for the shore. The five persons rescued by the Emma proved Benjamin Cuddiford, able seaman, of the Eurydice, whose home is at Plymouth; Sydney Fletcher, ordinary seaman, of the Rover, who was taking passage in the Eurydice, and who resides Bristol; Lieutenant Francis Hope Tabor, First Lieutenant of the Eurydice, who resided- Cheam, Ssurrey; Captain Terrier, R.E., who was taking passage the Eurydice; and petty officer, named Bennett, late of the Rover, who was also taking passage. It is known that Bennett was married man* but neither of the rescued men have any idea where bis wife resides. The captain of the schooner believes that Lieut. Tabor; Captain Ferrier, and Bennett were dead when they wet© pioked up, and in this view the medical men concurred.

DISTRESSING SCENE

heardrending scene occurred this afternoon when Mrs. Tabor, who had been married to the deeeaaed officer but months arrived town, and proceeded to identify the body of her husband. Her grief was terrible to behold, so great, indeed, that the men who bad charge of the house where the remains lay, felt themselves unable to remain in the place, leaving the unfortunate lady alons with the dead.

THE SURVIVORS INTERVIEWED. [CENTRAL NEWS TELEGRAM. |

Portsmouth, Monday Night. With reference to the wreck the Eurydioe, matters remain much about the same as this, morning. This aitemoon, the two survivors special orders brought Admiral 

at Portsmouth, bywhom they were interviewed , privately for the information of the Admiralty. ( Subsequently they were seen by the Central News ■ Portsmouth, correspondent, to whom the follow- information was detailed: —Ben. Cuddiford, 36, 1 single, said: I was able seaman board ! the Eurydice, I was on the pert watch Sunday afternoon. I went on deck at noonday. There were then one hundred and fifty men deck in the watch, were to come off j watch at fonr o'olock. were under full sail, , making for Spithead. We set the lowest stuasail 1 fust before two o'olock, and took it in again about quarter to four, just when the gale and snow storm came upon us. We had taken in the lower and were about to take in the upper sails, the men being aloft,, when the ship gave a lurch, and the captain ordered the men to come down, as the ship , was listing over to starboard, and the water was the lee bulwarks. I cannot say whether they had got down when the ship turned over. I was the weather side, letting go the ropes to let the sails ease off. After the first turn over she righted a bit, some few feet, nnd then went down bow first. As she sank, she gradually turned over, and and number of men , got on to the bottom near the keel. The captain was also on the bottom and remained fast. and • some other men jumped astern of the sinking ship, which remained on her side for about five minutes and then went down bow first. and another seaman, who was afterwards 1 drowned, tried to cut away the cutter on the port side of the ship as she was sinking. We had got one of the grips undone when the vessel went down, and we were obliged leave it. I picked up a lifebuoy, and having fastened to myself , struck out away from the ship. As the vessel j sank the suction carried down a number of people. passed the two surgeons, but oould not render them any assistance. One of them, Mr. Mur- dock, was has shirt sleeves, but they i were too much exhausted to cry out. The wind was just abaft the beam on the port tack. There were four guns on board, but all were well secured. The ports, however, were opened. Captain Hare was very fond of the ship, and all the crew had great faith in her. The captain was on deck J charge of the watch, and was giving orders just | before we were struck by the gale. We were going , about eight and a half knots, and there was no sign of squall. About ten minutes to fonr were turned on dock to lower studsails and to get in upper sails. As I have before stated, whou the captain ordered us down from aloft I did not hear anything carried away, and cannot say Whether any of the masts went by the board. There were about 150 men on deck altogether in the watch. SCENES THE WATER. I saw one of the officers, Mr. Murdock, swimming in the water. I also saw the boat- j swain, Mr. Brewer, swimming about. He was . much exhausted, and his eyes appeared to be , starting out of his head. I was in water about { one hour and twenty minutes. I did not seem£to 1 feel the cold until I stepped on to the deck of tht schooner that rescued us, and then appeared to Tose consciousness. The seaman named Bennett, captain of the quarter-deck, was the man who tried to get away the cutter wiA me. Poor feliow, he was drowned. His wife saw him j off at Portsmouth. Lieut. Tabor and Captain , Ferrier, of Royal Engineers, were also in the water with us, but both died after getting on t board the schooner that rescued us. We were I Tery kindly treated on board the Emma. I saw several men pass me in the water, and two but- 1 geons, but they were too exhausted to speak. IN THE GRASP OF DEATH. Sydney Fletcher, 19, single, belonging to Bris- 1 tol, corroborated the narrative of Cuddiford, and added that, on jumping off the wreck, a number of men attempted to seize them in the endeavour to be saved. They had, however, moat reluctantly to push them off. One poor fellow seized Fletcher's cork waistcoat, and in order to save himself be had to thrust the unfortunate man away, and he sank to rise no more. The cries of the drowning were most piteous to listen to. THE CAPTAIN FIRM AT HIS POST. The last time the survivors saw the captain, was when he was standing firm to bis post on the sinking vessel. As she disappeared beneath the . waves, dozens of poor fellows were dragged down by the vortex caused by the sinking vessel. Hay- made their depositions to the Admiral, at Portsmouth, the two survivors returned to the \ Isle Wight, in. the charge of Dr. Wells, of , Ventnor. The two men were eagerly questioned many relatives of those who had gone down in the Eurydice, and the effect upon them, caused by the hopeless answers of the survivors, was most distressing to witness. LIST OF THE SHIP'S OFFICERS. Ventnob, M. day Night. The wreck is lying directly in the course of vessels going up and down Channel, and efforts are now being made to remove the masts, sails, and rigging, for which purpose riggers, shipwrights, and divers from Porttaiouth dockyard are employed. The officers of the Eurydice included the following:—Captain Marcus A. S. Har , Lieut. Francis H. Tabor, Lieut. Charles V. Strange, Lieut. J. E. Black, Lieut. Stanley, A. B. Burney, staff surgeon; Jas. L. Whitney, paymaster; Frank Pitman, sub-lieutenant; Hon. Edward B. Gifferd, sub-lieutenant; Herbert S. Edmunds, sub-lieutenant; WalterS. Smith, sub-lieutenant; Sidney G. Randolph, surgeon; Robt. Murdock, M.8., gunner; Fredk. Allen, boatswain; Wm. Brewer, boatswain; Joseph Warren, assistant-clerk; Wm. Lamont, sub-lieutenant- The Hon. Edward Robert Gifford was brother and heir-presumptive to Lord Gifford, who served with distinction in the Ashantee expedition. The bodies of Captain Terrier and of Mr. Bennett, petty officer, wore identified by the survivors. THE INQUEST AND VERDICT. On Tuesday afternoon, the Coroner for the Isle of Wight, Mr. Frederick Blake, opened an inquest on the bodies Francis Hope Tabor, late first-lieutenant of the Eurydice, Captain L.ouis John George Ferrier, R.E., and Bennett, a petty officer, which had been landed from the schooner Emma by the crew of which vessel they had been picked up, along with the two survivors. The jury consisted of 13 gentlemen residing Ventnor. Mr. R. Montagu Tabor said he lived Carshalton, Surrey. He had seen the body which had been viewed the jury, and he identified it as his brother, Lieut. Tabor. He lost saw him alive about five or six months ago. He had since been to the West Indies in the Eurydice, and was on his way home her when the catastrophe occurred. Deceased would have been 30 years of age in July next. Benjamin Cuddiford said; I am an A.8., and reside at Millbay, Plymouth. I have seen the bodies of three deceased, and I am able to identity them. They are Lieut. Tabor, man named Bennett, do not know his Christian name, and a Captain of R.E., who was taking passage in the ship. Lieut. Tabor was first lieutenant on the Eurydice, and I was A. B. on board her. Bennett was captain of the quarter deck. She was wooden sailing ship of four guns, She has been employed as a training ship, having been thirteen months on commission. During the winter she has . been all round the West India Islands. Her captain was Captain Marcus Hare. We left Bermuda on our homeward voyage on the 6th March, being bound for Portsmouth. I should think, hut I am not certain, that we hod over 300 officers, and men on board, including supernumeraries. There were about 30 men belonging the ship's company and the rest were ordinary seamen, who, the conclusion of a training, leave the ship. On Sunday last, just before two o'clock, we Were turned on deck to set the lower studding soil. The ship was then off the Isle of Wight. All plain sail had been set before this. All was set except the topgallant studding sails, and they were unbent. The weather at that time was very fine, the wind, which was blowing a moderate breeze, being just abaft the beam. Between 3.30 and o'clock the port watch was called* to take in the lower studding sail. We had not then encountered a squall, but it was looking dirty. Captain Hare gave the order, saying " Watch in, lower studding sail." was then coming on to blow hard. This sail was taken in, and Captain Hare then gave orders to the royal yacht men go aloft and take the royals. They were not taken as the squall then struck us, and Capt. Hare ordered the men from aloft for their safety. The royals were, I believe, lowered at beat time, but not furled. The captain gave orders as the squall caught to let the maintopsad halfyards and the mainsheet. That was done, saw the gunner's mate let them go. The ship was thence her beam ends, the men on the lee side being their waists in water. I heard the captain say to som one forward—" If you can't let go, cut it. expect the captain was referring to the foresheet, out can't say. I then climbed up and got on the weatner netting, and crawled on to the ship's side, as she was turning over. I did this get on the weather side of the ship. I could Bee her fceel and her sails were in the water. She righted few feet, and saw her mizen topsail out of the water. Then looked forward and saw the ship sinking from forward, taking down a body of men with her. The water then began to increase aft, and just as it got line with the mainmast she turned over, and the boats turned bottom over. The ship's keel was then out of *ne water. stuck snip, and captain gave me orders to try and get the cutter clear by cutting the gripes. cut the forward gripe, and then the water encroached us. The captain was just behind me on the side of the ship. man who was helping me cut the gripe, , He was named Richards, and was washed away, he being, think, numbed with the cold. saw the two doctors jompoverboard, and soon (after did the same. I passed the two doctors drowning, but could not render them any assistance. observed many others m the water. swam round and got a life buoy, and then Went to the assistance of others, giving them pieces of wood and spars. had on lifebuoy. The ship must have gone down just as jumped off. The captain was still on her side, and he went down on her. I saw six men on the bottom of a boat called the copper punt. I spoke to them. They asked me if there was any hope, and I told them to keep their spirits up. They were washed off the bottom of the punt one one. I saw one let go owing to the cold. One of the men clinging the boat was called Mason, another Martin. There was a cook's mate who was taking passage home, he having been left behind by the Tamar. The other three men were ordinary seamen. saw one other person, Mr. Brewer, the boatswain, with a lifebuoy. the squall came on I turned my back to it. When the mist cleared away I saw Fletcher near me. I made for the shore, and he did the same. We were swimming about for an hour and 20 minutes, when we were picked up by the schooner. When got to my feet on the schooner felt giddy. was sensible when they picked me up, as I got hold rope which they flung to me. By the Jury: came to blow between 3 and 3.30. We had afterwards tremendous squall, which must have been the cause of the capsizing of the vessel. snowstorm came on, and we could not see the land. There was an attempt to bring her up to the wind, there being five men the wheel, and the Hon. Mr. Gifford, sub-lieutenant, went to assist them. An attempt was made to put the helm up after we could not take in the royals. I cannot say if the helm was put or not. When the ship was on even keel, the ports were four or five feet above water. The guns were well secured on board, and were not shifted at all. There was one watch, which might number 150, below the time the order was given to shorten sail. They were writing and sleeping. The captain gave orders to shorten sail as soon as he saw the squall coming quick. The Coroner: Who was the officer of the watch at the time?— Witness: I recollect now, which I didn't yesterday, that Sub-Lieutenant Randolph was the officer of the watch. He was forward, helping to shorten sail when the squall came on. The ship went down five minutes after she first got on her beam ends. When she first heeled, the starboard quarter boats were filled and carried away. The galley was smashed, and it was impossible to lower any of the boats. The captain was on deck before the squall came on. There was a hie buoy on each side of the bridge, and one on each bow of the launch forward, and one astern—five, in all, on deck. There were about twelve lifebelts in one the launches, as they hod been in use the day before, when the men were over the side painting. Mr. Harvey: Directly the captain saw the squall commg, he ordered the reduction of sail, and the largest one in the ship was taken in at once, that being the lower studding sail. The men were-lowering the royals when the captain, seeing the squall coming on, shouted them down, and added—"Let go-the main topsail halyards and the main sheet." The captain ordered the men down for fear the topgallant mast and royal mast would be carried away with the men on it. Mr. Harvey: As an able seaman do you think there was any fault in seamanship to account for the loss of this vessel?— Witness: No, sir. The captain was a thorough seaman, and so were all the officers. I have been the service nearly 21 years, and I have never seen squall come so suddenly before. Captain George Henry Ferrier, of the 105 th regiment, now quartered Colchester, identified the body of his brother, Captain Louis John George Ferrier, R.E., who was quartered at Bermuda. He was, witness surmised, coming home on leave, and probably the captain of the Eurydice gave him a passage. Deceased was in his 38th year. Sydney Fletcher, aged 19, said: I was first-class orderly seaman on board the Eurydice. It was my watch below last Sunday from noon to four p.m. was getting my tea to come on watch at that time, when! heard rush of water coming in through the ports which are on the main deck. Immediately before that she had given a rather strong lurch. I lowered the after port and ran on deck: The water was then coming over the starboard nettings. I assisted overhauling the foretop sail halyards. I then got over the port netting and walked right aft on the side of the ship. I walked below her ports. She was then on her side and the water nearly amidships. It was blowing hard and snowing at the time, and the sea was breaking over the ship. I saw the captain standing on the side of the ship giving orders to clear away the cutter. picked a life belt and jumped into the sea. Mr. Edwards, the sub-lieutenant, took off his coat and jumped overboard just as did. I saw Lieutenant Tabor on the side of the ship in his shirt sleeves and without his cap. I also saw him in the water floating a wash deck locker. shouted to the schooner and was so full of joy when I saw her I did not know what was doing. saw Bennett and the boatswain floating me. I did not notice the wind increase before the ship lurched. Ido not think more than two men of the starboard watch got on deck besides me. I heard them crying and screaming. got up as my mess was close to the forward hatchway. know that we had iron ballast, and that the water and stores acted as ballast as well. Cuddiford recalled said the Eurydice had the proper ballast for her tonnage, and beyond that there was a lower tier of tanks, full of water, which was never disturbed. William Langworthy Jenkins said: I am master of the schooner Emma, of Padstow, and on Sunday last I was proceeding from Newcastle to Poole. About 10 minutes past 4 we encountered sudden squall, while were off Dunnose. Previously to it coming on it was looking bad to the windward. Therefore I ordered the flying jib to hauled down and vj.so the main top mast staysail and other sails. Afterwards I lowered foresail. Then I only had the standing jib set properly on my ship. We did this d*ring tne squall which lasted half hour. The from four to five miles from land when the squall struck her. I saw nothing of the Eurydice before she went down, but after the snowstorm I saw something floating on the water, and it being reported be a man I steered towards it. I heard cries for help and found five men floating. They were kbout a quarter of a mile apart from one another. picked them up and all were exhausted and insensible. We took them in the cabin and stripped them and rubbed them. Ouddiford and Fletcher were able to take some coffee, but the others could not. Medical men came, but three were dead then, Bennett, fact, was dead when he was picked up. I should not have thought the squall was of such force to capsize such vessel as the Eurydice, even when under full sail. Dr. Winson proved having tried to restore animation to the deceased, but failed to do so. He believed death resulted from drowning in each case. Henry Parkinson, able seaman on board the Emma, proved seeing the Eurydice ten minutes before the squall. She had plain sail on her, and it was not, in his opinion, too much, considering the weather, for her to be then cairying. He was surprised to hear of her loss. He had been in a great deal heavier squalls, and he noticed in some cases vessel dismantled, while another close by had escaped. Photographs showing the partiality of this squall were put in. ~ . This being all the evidence, and the Jury believing the whole of the facts which could be before them had been proved, the Coroner proceeded to sum up. VERDICT. The jury retired, and after absence of half hour, returned with the following verdict:—"The jury unanimously find that the three deceased were accidentally drowned owing to the capsizing of her Majesty's ship Eurydice, by a sudden squall, at Dunnose, on Sunday, the 24th inst., and the jury consider that, from the evidence adduced, no blame whatever can attach t the captain, officers, and men of the ship."

LOSS OF H.M.S. EURYDICE, WITH THREE HUNDRED MEN

The wreck of the Eurydice, the training-ship for young ordinary seamen, of the Isle of Wight, and almost within sight of Spithead, to which place she was approaching at the end of a pleasant and successful cruise to the West Indies, is a disaster which calls to mind the loss of the Captain off Cape Finisterre. With this exception, there is nothing to compare with the calamity which occurred on Sunday afternoon, so far as the Navy is concerned, though the loss of life has frequently been exceeded by the sinking of emigrant-vessels. The circumstances are similar in many respects to those attending the loss of the Captain, both ships having turned over and sunk during a gale of wind, all their sail being at the time set. So far as can be ascertained, the Eurydice had 3G8 souls on board at the time. But this is very much a matter of con-jecture, as, besides her own officers and crew, she was bringing home a number of military officers, supernumeraries, and invalids from the West Lades. Hence considerable uncer-tainty exists both as to the names and number of the sufferers. The Eurydice was a wooden, full-rigged sailing ship of 921 tons displacement, and was at one time considered one of the smartest and quickest twenty-six-gun frigates in the service. She was built about 1843. Last year she was con-verted into a training-ship for ordinary seamen at Mr. John White's yard at Cowes, and was completed for sea at Ports-mouth Dockyard. She was commissioned on Feb. 7, 1877, and finally sailed from Portsmouth on Nov. 13 with a crew of about MO ordinary seamen and the officers. All the officers and crew are lost, with the exception of two seamen. Captain Marcus flare had been at one time Commander of the St. Vincent, training-ship at Portsmouth, and was selected for the command from his knowledge and experience of young seamen. Lieutenant Francis Tabor was a thoroughly efficient sailor, haying had command of the Cruiser in the Mediterranean. Among the other officers who have perished is Sub-Lieutenant the Hon. Edward Robert Gifford, next brother to Lord Gifford. The Eurydice was accompanied from Ports-mouth by the training-brig Martin, and was joined at Madeira by the Liberty from Plymouth. These vessels were filled with ordinary seamen, whom it was considered necessary to inure to the sea by a lone cruise : and. as they were all drauffhted 

from the home training-ships, the distress caused by their loss is spread over the whole country. They were young and mostly unmarried men ; in this respect the crew differs from that of the Captain, who were principally able-bodied seamen and petty officers. The Liberty arrived at Portsmouth a few days ago, the Eurydice being detained for the purpose of taking up supernumeraries. Captain Hare, however, expected to be home almost as soon as the Martin. The Eurydice left Bermuda on the 0th inst., and nothing was heard of her until she was seen by the coastguard at Bonchurch, at 3.30 on Sunday afternoon, bearing for Spithead under all plain sail, and with her port stunsails set on the fore-topmast and maintopinast, the object being clearly to arrive at the anchorage at Spithead before nightfall. There was an ominous stillness prevailing at this time. A heavy bank of clouds was coming down from the north-west, and the glass was falling rapidly. Such wind as there was came from the westward, and blew on the port quarter of the ship. The Isle of Wight is of peculiar formation on its southern fringe, having what may be considered as a double coast line extending from Blackgang Chine as far as Shanklin. The inner circle of the downs reaches a height of 500 ft. above the sea, and affords a deceptive shelter to ships well in shore. From the direction in which the Eurydice was steering she would be in comparatively smooth water, sheltered by the downs, until she rounded Datums° Head, where the disaster occurred. This circumstance will also serve to explain the fact that the Emma, schooner, which was near at the time, was not affected by the gale. At ten minutes to four the wind suddenly veered round from the west to the eastward, and a gale, accompanied by a blinding fall of snow, came rushing from the high lands down Luccombe Chine, striking the Eurydice just a little before the beam, driving her out of her course, which was heading to the north-east, and turning her bows to the east. This is what seems probable, though, from the manner in which the sea was concealed by the snow, nothing was seen of her at the supreme moment when she capsized to starboard. The air cleared as suddenly as it became overcast, the wind sinking away at the same time. 
■•• 

As soon as anything could be seen, the masts and top-hamper of the ship were discerned above the water about 2f miles ENE. off Dunuose, a well-known and lofty landmark between Shanklin and Ventnor. The ship lies in eleven fathoms of water, and from her position she appears to have righted in going down. Of the whole number of souls on board, only two persons succeeded in reaching the shore alive. These are an able seaman named Benjamin Cuddiford, a native of Plymouth, and Sydney Fletcher, an ordinary first-class seaman, aged nineteen, belonging to Bristol. Lieutenant Tabor died before reaching the shore, and the only other bodies which hay* been recovered are those of Colonel Ferrier, R.E., and a petty officer named Bennett. Their bodies, which were picked up as they drifted towards Ventnor on an ebb tide, were taken into a cottage at Ventnor, to await the Coroner's inquiry. The two survivors were first taken to the Esplanade and subsequently to the Cottage Hospital at Bonchurch, where they were attended by Dr. Williamson, of Ventnor, for the night. They were both brought over to Portsmouth on Mon-day afternoon. Much surprise has been caused by the small number rescued, and this more especially as the time being at hand for the changing of the watch a great many men would be on deck at the time. It appears, too, that the crew were assembling for prayers. Ordinary seamen are taught swimming as part of their training for the sea. No doubt numbers threw themselves overboard when the ship capsized, and were sucked down by the ship and carried out to sea by the tide ; but it is likely that the majority succumbed through becoming chilled by the cold. Captain Langworthy Jenkins, master of the Emma schooner, bound from Newcastle for Poole with coals, was the means of rescuing the survivors, and brought his ship into Portsmouth. He states that at forty-five minutes past four on Sunday afternoon, after a heavy squall, the atmosphere cleared, and he observed some wreckage and the royals of a ship flapping above the water. He also fancied he heard some one shouting for assistance. He sent a man into the rigging to look out, who reported that he saw a man floating in the water with a rfmrk jacket. He immediately made sail and stood towards • Having to tack once to fetch him, he hoisted out boats, hich picked up four men, and one man was picked up from he ship. He did his best to restore their circulation, but one  the men had died before he was got on board. Captain Jenkins then stood for Ventor with colours half-mast high



and a boat came off. doctor was sent for, but two other men died before he arrived. The Coastguard boat afterwards came alongside with Commander Eoach, who recognised the body of Lieutenant Tabor, the First Lieutenant of the Eurydice, and the other as an officer of the Royal Engineers. When the men were picked up, Dunnoee bore NW. by W. three to four miles. The boy Fletcher is too weak to furnish full particulars of the sad affair. He states, however, that he was below with the greater part of the crew, when, hearing a noise, he rushed up the hatchway and heard a cry, All hands for themselves ! He caught life-buoy and jumped overboard, as did also the rest who were picked up. A minute afterwards the ship gave a lurch forward and sank, drawing him down to a considerable distance; but the life-buoy raised him again. In an account given by Cuddiford, which we insert below, is stated that the ship capsized in a squall and snowstorm, at, as nearly as he can state, four o’clock in the afternoon, when they were five miles from Dunnose. There were over 300 men on board, all of whom, except himself and Sydney Fletcher, who belonged to the Rover, were, he thought, drowned. A telegram having been forwarded on Sunday evening to the Commander-in-Chief at Portsmouth informing him of the occurrence, Admiral Fanshawe at once dispatched the two Government tugs the Grinder and the Camel to the wreck, in charge of Commanders Polkinghome and Dathan, the two Master Attendants of the yard. The wreck was reached about midnight. The ship was found lying on her starboard bilge, on a fine sandy beach, in eleven fathoms of water, and with her head about south-east, having almost slewed round during the circular storm. Her fore and mizen topgallant masts had been carried away, the topgallant sails hung before the topsails, with the main topgallant masts standing, and all her sails set. Leaving Commander Dathan in charge of the wreck, Commander Polkinghome came back to Portsmouth at five o’clock on Monday morning to report to the Commanderin-Chief and to dispatch the requisite aid. The Grinder accordingly sailed to the spot with twenty-five riggers, some shipwrights, and a couple of divers, with the necessary gear. The sails and tophamper of the wreck were removed, and the tugs will remain to watch the spot. There will be no difficulty in raising the ship by means of lumps. As a matter of form, a court-martial will be held upon the two survivors. These two on arrival at Portsmouth, were taken to Admiralty House, before the Commander-in-Chief, and were afterwards taken to Yentnor, in order that they might give evidence before the county Coroner for the Isle of Wight. Before leaving Portsmouth, Cuddiford made a statement to Admiral Foley of the circumstances attending the wreck. He said: seven bells on Sunday afternoon the watch at a quarter to four o’clock was called to take in lower studdingsails. I was on deck to tend the lower tack, and let it go. The Captain gave orders to take in the upper sails. The wind was then freshening. The Captain ordered the men to come down from aloft and then to let go the topsail-halliards. The gunner’s mate let go the topsail-halliards, and another man, Bryant, let the maiusheet. The water was then running over the lee netting on the starboard side, and washed away the cutter. The foretopmast studding-sail was set. The wind was about a point abaft the port beam. I caught hold of the main truss, fell, and caught hold of the weather netting and got on the ship’s side. We could see her keel. She righted a little before going down, ringing the mizen-topsail out of the water. She then went gradually over from forward, the greater part of the hands being at the forepart of the ship outside. She then turned over, bringing the port cutter bottom upwards. I and another, Richards, out the foremost gripe, and then saw the Captain standing on the vessel’s side near the quarter-boat and the two doctors struggling in the water. I swam some distance, keeping over my head a lifebuoy, which I found, and then picked up some piece of wreck, which I gave to some of the men in the water. I then came across the copper punt full of water, five men were it. The sea capsized the punt, and they all got on the bottom. They asked me if there was any signs of help. I told them that the best thing they could do was to keep their spirits up. One of them was just letting go his hold of the punt. Ido not know his name. I next saw Mr. Brewer, the, boatswain, with a cork lifebelt on. He was struggling strongly. I then saw Fletcher in the water with a cork belt and breaker. I lost sight of him during the snow. About five minutes afterwards the weather cleared up. I saw Fletcher again, and we kept together. Then we saw land, but, finding it too rough, we turned our backs to the land and saw a schooner. The schooner bore down on us, sent a boat, and picked up two officers that I had not previously noticed with a wash-deck locker. A rope’s end was thrown to me from the schooner, and I was then picked up. I judge that I was in the water one hour and twenty minutes. The officers picked up were Lieutenant Tabor and a captain of the Royal Engineers who came on board at Bermuda with one corporal, one bombardier, four privates, and a servant of officer of the Royal Engineers. The ship capsized about ten minutes before four o’clock. The captain was giving orders at the time, and was carrying out his duty. We rounded on the weather beam, and set the lower studding-sail, at two p.m. The ship was then going eight knots and a half. I don’t know who was the officer of the watch, as the captain was carrying on the duty. The Hon. Mr. Gifford went to the wheel to help at the time the water was coming over the lee nettings, in consequence of an order being given to put the helm up. There were the following supernumeraries on board :—Three court-martial prisoners from the Rover; one A. 8., court-martial prisoner from Bermuda; an ordinary seaman, named Parker, who had been tried by court-martial (he belonged to the Eurydice); and about twelve or fourteen Marines, with one sergeant of Marines from Bermuda Dockyard, two invalids from Bermuda Hospital, one ship’s corporal from the Argus, one captain’s cook from the Argus, one engineer’s steward from the Argus, one ship’s cook from Bermuda Dockyard, one quartermaster, named Nicholas, from the Rover. I believe some of the maindeck ports were open to let in the air to the main-deck mess. I don’t think the hands were turned ; there was hardly time for that. I saw most of the men forward take off their clothes and jump off before I lost sight of them in the squall. When the snow cleared the ship was gone down.” During Monday the Commander-in-Chief at Portsmouth was in constant communication with her Majesty and the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty; and in the course of the day he received the following telegrams from the Queen. The first, which came direct from her Majesty, was in the following terms: The Queen is deeply grieved to hear of the loss of the Eurydice. Her Majesty anxiously asks for further details.” The second was transmitted to the First Lord of the Admiralty, and was to the following effect;— “The Queen would ask Mr. Smith to make known her grief at the terrible calamity to the Eurydioe, and her heartfelt sympathy with the afflicted friends and relatives.” In another telegram to Mr. Smith the Queen said the telegrams had caused her the greatest grief. These telegrams, haying been forwarded to Admiral Fanshawe, were promptly posted at the dockyard gates, where they were eagerly read by sympathetic crowds. Admiral Foley visited the wreck in the course of the afternoon, and, from an examination of the rigging and gear of the ship, he is firmly of opinion that the crew were in the act of shortening sail at the time the ship sank. In this opinion he is supported by the pilots who are assisting at the wreck. They found that the topsails had been let go, and that the mizentopsail was actually resting on the cap. The squall, however was evidently too sudden and powerful for the crew to relieve the ship in time. There is also reason for concluding that the ports on both sides were open, and that the water rushed in on the starboard side, which prevented the ship from righting and pulled her over. The divers and riggers were engaged on Monday in relieving the wreck of her spars and sails. No attempt has yet been made to penetrate below decks. It i expected that a month will elapse before the ship can be raised and brought into harbour. The inquest on the bodies of Lieutenant Tabor, Captain Louis Ferrier, E.E., and an ordinary seaman named Bennett, was held at Yentnor on Tuesday, by Mr. F. Blake, Coroner for the Isle of Wight. Mr. E. J. Harvey, of Portsmouth, attended as agent for the Admiralty, with Commander Eoche, of the Coastguard. The principal evidence was that of Benjamin Cuddiford and of Sydney Fletcher the only survivors from the Eurydice; and that of Captain Jenkins, master of the Emma schooner, which they were picked up. The statement of Cuddiford at the inquest was not materially different from that which he had before made to the Port Admiral, and which is given above; it was confirmed by the evidence of Fletcher. The jury found, as their verdict, that the deceased persons were accidentally drowned by the capsizing of H.M.S. Eurydice a sudden squall, and that no blame whatever can be attached to the captain, officers, and men of the ship.” A committee has been formed at Portsmouth, and another in London, to raise money for the benefit of the families of the seamen and marines who have lost their lives this disaster. Messrs. Glyn, Mills, and Co., of Lombard-street, and Messrs. Cocks and Biddulph, of Charing-cross, receive subscriptions for this purpose. The members of the House of Commons have made a special subscription amongst themselves. Our Illustration of the foundering of the Eurydice, which forms the large Engraving presented for the Extra Supplement this week, has been drawn by the aid of Sketches and verba] description supplied by the seaman Benjamin Cuddiford, one of the two survivors of the crew. THE BRITISH FLEET IN THE SEA OP MARMORA. The Engraving on the front page of this week’s Number represents one of the steam-launches, armed with a gun at the hows, which belong to the ironclad squadron under the command of Admiral Hornby in the Sea of Marmora, and which are kept nightly employed “on the look out” for hostile torpedoes, all around the present station of our ships in Tuzla Bay. The Standard has published the following letter from a naval correspondent, which our readers will find of more especial interest from the Illustrations we have lately presented of the British fleet in those waters near the entrance to the Bosphorus and the city of Constantinople:— Ismid, March 11 The British public are, as rule, so little acquainted with the movements and whereabouts of English men-of-war, that communications from time to time bear an interest, not only to those having relatives in our Royal Navy, but to the ordinary readers of daily newspaper. The eastern division of Admiral Hornby’s squadron consists of four powerful iron ships, carrying heavy rifled ordnance, steaming at a rapid rate, and having their sides protected by armour-plating varying from in. to 12 in. With such a squadron for attacking purposes, and surrounded by a flotilla of gun-boats such as are on service in Turkish waters, our friends at home have little to fear but that, should occasion arise, the British flag will, as of old, give a good account of itself. Practice makes perfect, and ultimately becomes perfection itself, or at all events approaches closely to it. Outsiders are mostly under the impression that officers and men have little or nothing to do in the Royal Navy. Visitors coming on board a man-of-war are at once struck with the snowy whiteness of the decks, the beauty and finish of the guns, the sparkling brilliancy of the brass, the polish of the woodwork; and, seeing that the crew are strong, ruddy, healthy, and wellclothed, ask, in the most innocent manner, Whatever do you find to do on board ship The answer is very simple drill; not only the system of foot exercise seen in the army, but drill aloft with spars, yards, and sails; drill below with men, small arms, and heavy guns. The work of cleaning and embellishing the ship is done in the early hours of the morning, so that by nine a.m. the decks are cleared up, and all is ready for the real work of the day. Steam has not quite superseded canvas as mode of propulsion, so one morning each week is devoted to sail drill, which gives the men confidence when aloft, and prevents the combatant officers from relying too much on the machinery of the ship. Notwithstanding that our modem men-of-war are boxes of machinery, the old seamanship which won so many battles is not allowed to die out. Other days are assigned to exercising the fighting portion of the crew in the manipulation of the rifle, cutlass drill, and in repelling imaginary boarders by the aid of cutlass and pistol. Heavy gun drill also forms prominent part of the duty of our seamen, who have to make themselves perfect in the machinery for moving these weapons, as well as acquiring a knowledge of their powers and the best method of utilising them. It is this perfect system of teaching that our bluejackets have attained superiority as artillerists ; and, coupling these daily exercises with actual practice at sea, it becomes no idle boast to assert that any object coming within range of our guns will be struck nine times out of ten. The manipulation and construction of torpedoes is no means neglected. Qualified instructors are employed to teach the younger seamen how and when to use these means of offence and defence; and, when opportunity offers, the torpedo-class leaves the ship, and from a boat is taught actual experiment. And, besides‘the combatants of a man-ofwar, there are on board a number of men who may be described as the mechanics and tradesmen of the ship. In this class are the important body of men known as stokers, to whose care are confided the repairs required by the steam-machinery and boilers ; then there are the carpenters, to whom are intrusted the wooden portions of the vessel, the boats, and upper masts and yards; the sailmakers, blacksmiths, caulkers, painters, ropemakers, each of whom finds plenty of work in his respective trade. In word, an English man-of-war in commission is a floating busy hive of industry. It is not every seaman who would care to pilot heavy ironclads into an unsurveyed position ; and yet, when told to leave

THE EURYDICE.

hendown Church, on Sunday. the Vital', the Rev. G. S. Kerney. preached special and collections on behalf of the relatives were made, amounting to 3e. At Lake ?Cation Church Ills. was collected. Special sermons were preached at the CA tn. gretottiomil Church, Hyde, and at Newport Parish Church on Sunday ; also at Portemou th, awl other places. The Lords of the Admiralty issued an on per yesterday (Tneiday) directing that a reward of is to be paid for the recovery of each of elle ' bodies of the unfortunate men lost in the Eurydice, and the whole of the funeral expenses will be borne by the Admiralty. The weather has prevented more being dram to the t urydiee during the past week. The Mansion House fund foe the relief of the sufferers now amounts to about AIAIOO. It bee been pointed out that the Eurydice a training ship fur ordinary seamen, not bop 's. The Pal, gives its reasons for believing th at Capt. Hare was bringing his vessel up Chum el with the ordinary• caution of a seaman, but s.•:oreely with a full apprehension of wh at might be the outcome of the squally appes •r--anee of the sky. He began in time to map to snug for hauling on a wind with a freehenis breeze. When be found the wind freshen' faster than presaged good, he ordered sail lat be shortened by fur lin g the royals. Befog e this could be carried out the ship was etrock by a heavy squall, and ere an attempt was made to put her before the wind she was knocked down on her side, and, her ports being open, she filled rapidly with water, and went. to the bottom. thus the Eurydice was thrown on her beam ends because she was struck by a squall, and because she was not run off the ' wind before she got the full weight of it. She heeled so rapidly to such an extreme angle because her lee ports were open, and she sank so suddenly from the same cause. Of course it has been asked if it was a pendent thing to sail with the lee ports open. As events turned out, it undoubtedly proved to be a very imprudent thing ; but no blame can be attached to Capt. Hare for this. It is customary to have the ports open under such conditions-- they propably would have been closed when the vessel was braced up after clearing Dunnose ; and if the ports were never opened because a ship might under the influence of a sudden squall, put her port sills under, it would show an excess of caution equal to that of a man who bou.ht a steam launch, but never lighted up because he was afraid the boiler might burst. A complete and searching enquiry into the lose of the ship is to be be made in the shape of a Court Martial. No more bodies have been recovered. ihe midship section of the ship shows that the ports were just upon Oft.. above the water-line, and that the comparatively small ieel of 18 deg. would bring the ports under water and prevent the vessel righting. A correspondent of the Dreesport writes i-1 here are many distressing cages of bereavement and suffering here. In one a poor woman in Devonport, who lost a father, mother, and two children 14 months, actually left the town early on Monday morning to be in Portsmouth to receive her husband, and only learnt the harrowing news on the road, when she returned a widow. In another case a young woman went round to be married to one of the young men ; she has been brought hack in such a condition, from shock sustained to the system, that her life is despaired of. A third case is that of a poor woman in Devonport, who, four months av lost her husband in the Narcissus ; whilst her husband was in that ship she loft and buried seven children; and in the Eurydice had lost her only remaining child and her only support. A hardhearted act has oome to my knowledge concern. ing this poor woman. She is fortunately entitled to .617 for the back pay of her deceased husband, and on Monday she went to a certain clergyman—a curate—and asked him to sign a certificate of her marr•age, in order to get the money. Notwithstandingthat she explained to him the distressing eircumstanom in which she was paced, he demanded Es. 6d. of her. She told him that she had not got the money, whereupon he refused his signature without the fee. The poor woman was obliged to borrow the money, which she obtained through a friend. Returning to the clergy. man she ;wawa the certificate. but it was necessary for her to remind the rev. gentleman that he had to give her tkL change to the Se. she had tendered in payment! "Ad above all things have fervent charity among yourselves, for charity shall cover a multitude of sins." A correspondent of the rises draws attention to the coincidence that a somewhat similar fate, under somewhat similar circumstances- 1 for it was almost within sight of her destination —betel the Eurydice's ill-fated consort ship 15 years ago—the Orpheus. In classic tale Eurydice was the wife of Orpheus. The Orpheus was entering the Manukan harbour, near Auckland, on a fine Saturday afternoon in February or March. 1863. Mistaking the 'channel she struck on the bar, about 40 only being saved. The brig Romulus, which weathered the storm in which the Eurydice foundered, has arrived from Wales at Dover, and her master, Capt. Stephens, reports his own observation of the squall which proved so disastrous. At the time its occurrence he was about 12 miles astern of the Eurydice, off the Isle of Wight, and noting a fall in the barometer. accompanied by an maw* outcast appearance of the sky. which seemed most threatening, ordered sail to be shortened, and the hands ready to the haulyards in OW of eamegvaey. It was not long before the storm observed on the snddanly down with all its set& upon tits ship, with a roar almost deafeaceg. At the eider " iind fre t a l t e the eaptaie, kolo ti d gar t i l l m e , were relaas ed, ricane had modersted, and the Resultts peessaded arriving safely at 9 p.m. at Dover. Capt. Stephens was of course Ignorant of the awful calamity that had happened on his path, and regrets he del net make the other side of the island, as he EWA have been ambled, like the Emma, to have saved ems of th. Eurydice's crew. THE loss of the Antics is a national calamity. In some terrible respect the catastrophe of the has been repeated. Both ships were caught in sudden squalls near the coast—Spain in one mum, England in the other—and both foundering, drown nearly all on board. At the same time, as thonrnds of ships, great and small, are continually caught in squalls, and very few indeed founder when there sea-room, we must suppose that the fatal result is due, as it was in the case of the alphas, to some radical defect in the vessel's trim. We have now lost about a thousand of our sailors from a cause which imperatively demands exhaustive analysis.— arid: The Homer says:—" Eurydice is an unlucky name. One Eurydice banged herself, another died of a serpent bite, and now a third goes to the depths in sight of the shores of the land from which she had long been absent" " It may interest some of your readers to know that the snow-storm of the 24th of March struck the Worcester end of the Malvern-hills from the north-west at 1 p.m., as the Priory church clock struck. It took threequarters of an hour to clear this end of the range. It travelled in a south-east direction, and arrived at the supposed position of the Eurydice, off the Isle of Wight, at 4.30 p.m. Its appearance was that of a white wall' bulging forward. There was no haze between my position and the advancing white wall, the distance of which I judged to be two and a half or three miles. Vith me it was sunshine ; I had not got 100 yards on my way down the bill when the storm overtook me. It travelled at a rate of 35 miles an hour, or a mile in lets than two minutes. Assuming the distance to Dunnose, as the crow flies, to be 115 miles, the rate the storm travelled would be 32/ miles an hour. The time the rear edge took to clear Malvern was three quarters of an hour; this would give a length of cloud 24.5 miles. Any one standing near an express train going at forty miles an hour knows the current which is produced, and, therefore, cannot be surprised at the enormous pressure a compact mass of cloud 24i miles "ong will exert on the place over which it passes at a rate of a mile in less than two minutes. As the mass of cloud was moving from N.W. to S.E. its length has been spoken of ; what its breadth may have been must remain unknown."

THB LOSS OF THE «EURYDICE."

j A-message from the Quern has been forwarded by the Admiralty to the relatives of the officers who ■were lost in the Eurydice, together with a letter conveying an expression of their lordships' deep re- gret at the sad eve it. On Friday morning a pilot lugger sailed into Port-mouth, and handed over to the Commander-in- Chief a sad, a boat's awning, a bucket, several other pieces of wreckage, and four caps, two of which j bore the ribband of the Eurydice, which had been picked up about 20 mile, to the westward of the place where the ship went down. On Friday the Lord Mayor received from Captain J. C. Wilson, ?? of the Thunderer, a commu- nication conveying to him, on behalf of the Ports- mouth Committee, an expression of their deep sense of his kindness in proposing to open a fund for the relief of the distressed relatives of those lost in the Eurydice, and gratefully accepting his offer. In the afternoon, also, Lord Charles Beresford, M.P , waited upon the Lord Mayor, and personally tendered him the thanks of the naval authorities at Portsmouth for the promptness of his assistance, which was much appreciated. The following appeal has been issu. d from the Mansion House on the subject: " The Lord Mayor, at the desire of the naval authorities at Portsmouth, will most gladly receive at the Mansion House donations for the support of the widows, or- phans, dependents, and relatives of the crew of Her Majesty's ship Eurydice, which sank off the Isle of Wight with nearly all hands on Sunday last. The loss of a gallant crew of over 300 young British sailors, withiii sight of home and in such distressing and appalling circumstances, has created a deep feel- ing of sorrow throughout the country. It has been thought that the sympathy of the public ia this dis- aster cannot be better or more practically shown than by affording aid to those bereaved relatives whose only means of support ha.c been cut off so suddenly and saily. Tne Portsmouth Committee are obtaining details of the number of widows, children, aged parents, and others rendered destitute by the calamity. The Lord Mayor meanwhile appeals to his fellow citizens and the public at large for dona- tions for the rehef of these sufferers, and he hopes that the response may be such as to enable him to remit a very handsome sum to the local committee at Portsmouth, with whom he is in direct communi- cation." Saturday aud Monday were blank days, so far as the clearing of the wreck of the Eurydice was con- cerned. The wind blew strongly and coldly from the north, and the dockyard tugs uid not leave their moorings. During the previous day the Dromedary, which had been anchored near the ecene of the wreck as a lightship, was obliged, in consequence of the violence of the weather, to slip her cables and make for Portland, where she arrived safely on Saturday morning. While the two ships are being got ready in the dockyard to lift the Eurydice and float her into harbour, experiments have been made in the yard with feur models of vessels, with the purpose of determining the best method of swinging the ship. One of the methods practised was suggested by Captain Brewer, the mate of the Camperdown steamer. Captain Coppin, who succeeded in raising the Alpheta from Bembridge Ledge a few weeks ago, has also offered his services, but he has been in- formed that the dockyard authorities will themselves conduct the operations. The Rinaldo is not only being prepared to float the ship, but is being fitted with sleeping accommodation for the riggers and divers, to remove the necessity of their leaving the ship. The more the matter of the foundering of the training ship is discussed the more necessary seems the holding of a naval inquiry, for the purpose of clearing up questions which were not submitted to the jury at Ventnor, and which only a court of pro- fessional and scientific experts will be able to fully appreciate. With reference, indeed, to one very important point, the jury were clearly misinformed. The boy Flet-her, from what he had heard among his mes-mates, was under the impression that the ballast of the ship was principally compo-ed of the water which was stored below for drinkino* and cooking purposes, and of the usual stores of the ship. At the end of the voyage, of course, the weight of the water and stores would bo much diminished, and ; heuce, had they constituted the main ballast of the Eurydice, her stability would have been greatly af- fected by their exhaustion. To rebut this evidence, the able seaman, Cuddiford, was recalled by the Admiralty agent, and he said that the ship had the proper amount of ballast for her tonnage, and that the lower tier of water-tanks was never disturbed. This was considered satisfactory by the jury, but it has been sime- discovered from drawings now in the possession of the Admiral .superintendent that the ship was not fitted with a second tier of tanks. It is not, however, believed by professional persons at Portsmouth that the reduction in the weight of water ana stores would seriously lessen the stability of the ship. The utmost difference which the loss during the voyage would make in the draught of the Eurydice would be about eight or ten inches, the only practical result of which would be to make her a little more " lively." In order to clear up the question of the amount of water in the ship at the time of foundering, Admiral Foley has instructed the divers to mea?ure the contents of the tanks as soon as they are reached ; but as they are not water- tight, and will have been filled with sea water, it is not considered likely that their present condition will affor l any guidance as to their state on Suuday, the 24th ult. The midship section of the ship also shows that the ports were just upon 6ft. above the water-line, and that the comparatively small heel of 18' would briug the ports under water aud prevent the vessel righting. On Sunday, at Portsmouth, reference was made to the sudden calamity in most of the pulpits, and in several of the churches collections were made on be- half of the friends aud relatives of the seamen Ou Saturday afternoon the remains of Captain J. G. L. Ferrier, R.E., of Bedside, Lin ith_row.-hire, who was drowned l_y the sinking of the Eurydice, were interred with military honours in Greyfriars' Churchyard, Edinburgh. Detachments of the 50th Regiment, the 6th Inniskilling Dragoons, and the Royal Artillery took part iv the procession. The streets along the r >ute were crowded with spectators. The remains of Lieutenaut Tabor, which, after the inquest at Ventnor, were conveyed to Cheam, Surrey, the residence of his family, were interred ra Cheam Churchyard on Friday afternoon. The corpse was followed by the Rev. R S. Tabor, the father, aud the brother and sister of the deceased, Mrs Tabor, the wifo of the gallant officer, being presn* at the church and grave. The coffin was covered by the Union Jack, a fitting pull, flowers forming a cross, and immortelles. The service, which was partly choral, was conducted by the rector, the Rev. O. 11. Rice, as-isted by several other clergymen. Despite the terrible weather, a large number of persons were present, comprising many of the resident gentry. Captain Fellowes, of the Royal Naval College, re- pic-eiitcd the Admiralty. The remains of Ceorge Arthur B mnett were in- terred in the cemetery at Haslar, clos^ by th<? spot at which the victims of the explosion on board the Thunderer were buried. The fuueral was a very quiet affair. No bmd attended, but a firing party of Marines, and a :_umber of blue-jackets who had volunteered from the various ships in harbour, were present. The spectators were very few. Tiie servioe was conducted by the Rev. Mr. Nickolby, chaplain to the hospital. At a meeting of the Middlesex D strict Lod re of Good Templars, on Saturday evening, the Rev. E. Schnadhorst, d strict chaplain, referred to tlie loss of the Eurydice, anl to the fact that on. of the Naval Lodges belonging to the Order had gone down with the ill-fated vessel. A resolution vvas unanimously adopted, expressing sorrow at the foundering of the Eurydice, and the entire loss of a lodge of Good Templars working under the title of the " Decoy Bird," and sympathy with the relatives of the deceased. In the House of Commons, on Monday, Mr.W. H Smith, iv reply to Captain Price, stat> d that the amount of ballast in Her Majesty's ship Eurydice when she left England was 3U tons, the amount she had always carried, and there was no reason to be- lieve any was removed. It was th- intention ot" the Admiralty to direct a complete enquiry into the loss of the ship. A writer in the Field (Mr. Henry Ligg) says: " It is often remarked that history repeats itself ; unhappily, in this melancholy oase it is so, for this ship is the second Her Majesty has lost from a simi- lar cause within sight of the same spot. Her Majesty's schooner Pincher, Lieutenant T. Hope commander, sailed from Sheerness for Portsmouth on Sunday, March 4, 1838, in company with H.M.s frigate Volage, 28 guns, Captaiu H Smith. On the following Tuesday afternoon, betweeu 4 and 5 p.m., the schooner was observed standin- iv for the Isle 2 windward of the Volage ; the weather fine, but the wind at times squally. The two ships were working towards Spithead. It is supposed, for no one is alive to tell the tale, that a squall caught the schooner, threw her on her beam-en Is, and, having a press of sail set, and a heavy gun amidships, with boats, soars, &c, on deck, she never righted, and all on board, about 35 souls, were instantly drowned. It is also said that wh.n the Vol tge missed her, she made exertions to discover where she was ; and that, it being then dark, a blue light was burnt and a gun fired to denote her posi- tion, in case any of the unfortunate people should be able to got to her ; but beyond that nothing was done, for the Volage made the best of her way to Spithead, without keeping the sea all night and at the dawn of day causing a look-ont to be kept for the wreck. It is also asserted that not uutil the following Saturday, in consequence of the rumours prevailing of the loss of the schooner, was any in- quiry or investigation made, and then a sort of gos- sip was held at the Port Admiral's office about her and her unfortunate crew. However, on Mond _y, I the 12th — five days afterwards— two Cowes pilots called on the Port Admiral to state that they had seen the «rutch of the mainboom of a vessel, supposed to belon_r to a man-of-war, floating about four miies and a half S.S. W. of the Owers ligh»--vessel ; and the second Master Attendant of tke dockyard, liaving been despatched early on Tuesday morniug — *x week after the accident — ascertained that the wreck of the Pincher was lying in about 14 fathoms of water, on her larboard broadside, with all sails set, and her head S.W. Measures were immediately taken to weigh her, but without success, in consequence of the tempestuous state of the weather and the heavy sea on the spot, and all returned to port. After several failures, it was not until June that the of- ficers of Portsmouth succeeded in raising her and towing her into the harbour. A coroner's inquest was held on ten of the bodies found on board, and a verdict returned, "Found deid on board the Pincher from suffocation, supposed to be caused by the over- setting of the vessel near the 0 vers Light." The Eurydice and the Modiste were the construction of .-.dmiral Elliott, C.8., and were different in two important elements of safety to any other vessels of their size in our own or the French navy. Of the Modiste, the Plymouth correspondent of the United Service Journal writes under date 20th of October, 1838 : - 1 fear I should fail in the attempt if I were to endeavour to describe to you the minute peculi- arities of the Modiste. It may however be remarked, in a general way, that she appears higher above the water than other ships of her class, and draws less water ' Of the Eurydice, the First Lord of the Ad- miralty stated in the House of Commons that the ship was 921 tons (about the same as the Modiste j ; was built by Admiral Elliott ; that she carried in the place of her old 26 guns two 64-pounder guns ; that she carried the same ballast as in former com- missions, and 117 tons of water as against 102 tons ; that her draught of water was 16ft. 6in. I may re- mark that I once owned a very fast merchant ship, of the highest class at Lloyd's, 341 tons, and she drew lbft. Oin. when in her best sailing trim ; and that our larcest cutter yacht, of 1 1 1 registered tons, draws 14ft. This small draught of water is less by about 4ft. than is usual in vessels betweeii 90) and 1000 tons, which, coupled with greater height out of water, aud the fact that both the ballasting power of the provisions and water for 300 men in a voyage across the Atlantic must have been materially re- duced, are, I think, reasons why this fine ship should not recover herself when struck by so exceptionally sudden and so unusually heavy a squall, before any amount of human sharpness and skill could reduce the canvas, which was by no means in excess of what any seaman in the world, in such a ship, would carry under similar circumstances of fair wiud and the fine weather that had prevailed all day un- til a few moments before the awful catastrophe, whicii the whole world will never cease to deplore." A correspondent of the Devonport, Independent writes : " I shall never forget the morning on which the news of the loss of the Eurydice was received in Devonport. The effect was truly awful. It seemed as if the Pagan demon Terror himself had made his appearance among the people. The hearts of men and women alike were stilled with affright and their tongues stricken dumb with pain. In such times of great calamity, and especially wheu that calamity is fearfully near us, the thoughts of most men myste- riously take a religious tone — are arrested by a deep and solemn conviction of the working of an Almighty and impenetrable Power above and beyond them. So it was with not a few persons in Devonport on Monday morniug. There arc many distressing cases of bereavement and suffering. In one a poor woman in Devonport, who lost a father, mother, and two children in 14 months, actually left the town eirly on Monday morning to be in Portsmouth to receive her husband, and only learnt the harrowing newson the road, when she returned a widow. In another case a young woman went round to be married to one of the young men ; she has been brought back in such a condition, from shock sustained to the system, that her life is despaired of. A third case is that of a poor woman in Devonport, who, four months ago, lost her husband in the Narcissus : whilst her husband was in that ship she lost aud buried seven children ; and in the Eurydice has lost her only remaining child and only support. A hard- hearted act has come to my knowledge concerning this poor woman. She is fortunately entitled to £17 for the back pay of her deceased husband, and on Monday she went to a certain clergyman — a curate — and asked him to sign a certificate of her mar- riage, in order to <ret the money. Notwithstanding that she explained to him the distressing circum- stances in which she was placed, he demanded 2s. Gd. of her. She told him that she had not got the money, whereupon he refused his signature without the fee. The poor woman was obliged to borrow the money, which she obtained through a friend. Returning to the clergymen she purchased the certi- ficate, but it was nece-sary for her to ren.in.l the rev. gentleman that he had to give her 6d. change to the 3s. she had tendered in payment ! ' And above all things have fervent charity among yourselves, for charity shall cover the multitude of sins.' lam gl id to learn, and the public will be equally so, that immediately after the catastrophe Mr. Metham re- soived to mitigate its gri .vous effects by opening to at least some of the bereaved f -trailies the orphan refuge of the magnificent institution over which he presides, of which he is the very life and soul, and which is one of the finest testimonies to a loving sympathy and to a broad-hearted chariy that any n ttion ever possessed. An election of orphan girls to the Royal Female Orphan Asylum takes place in a week or two hence, but a special effort will be m.de to meet this exceptional and bitter trouble. Well done ! Th" crown of charity is the richest and brightest crown of all: charity to the orphan is the most Divinely blessed charity of all." Mr. J. G-. Livesay, writing to the Timrs fro-^i Veutuor, says : " Will you allow me to make a pro- posal through the übiquitous columns of the Times, which, if adopted, will briug a large accession to the fund now being raised for the widows, orphans, and other dependent relatives of the brave men whom the nation has so grievously lost? It is that a simul- taneous collection be made on Saturday next by employers throughout the country in their offices, shops, factories, farmyards, workshops, etc. The builders in this town have promised me that they will make such an appeal to their hauds, and I am sure thnt it will meet with a hearty response. I believe there are few workiug men in the British Lies who would not on such an occasion cheerfully give a quarter or half of a day's pay, according as the circumstances of their own families might per- mit. The ht ad of every household should ask each of his servauts for a tritle, and even our cliildren may give their penny and upwards. A very erro- neous impression is abroad, even here ou the scene of the catastrophe, as to the probable number of persons who will require relief. Because the Eu- rydice was a training ship it has been assumed that uearly all her crew would be very young and un- married But she was a training ship for ordinary seamen, not boys, and I have just been informed on good authority that a much larger proportion of the crew were married than had been supposed. Let no one be afraid of giving too much. Even if there should be a surplus after providing for the present sufferers, it might form a valuable reserve fund for simdar cases in the future, just as the large surplus of the Hartley Colliery Explosion Fund has proved so useful for other contingencies of its kind." j A correspondent to the Globe writes : " The loss of 1 th« Eurydice has called attentiou to a matter of no little importance, affecting as it does the welfare of seamen. It appears that the master of the Emma the schooner which rescued the five survivors of the sunken vessel, when he got the men on board, could not apply the usual restoratives because his was what is known as a 'temperance craft.' That is to say, the Emma did not carry any stimulants for her crew, and, what is still more serious, the medicine chest contained neither brandy nor any kind of spirits. From these facts it appears urgently m ces- sary for the Board of Trade to take immediate s.eps to prevent such omissions in future ; for, howtvei* ' desirable it may be to keep a crew sober, the indio- syncracies of the ma-W of a vessel should not be allow-d unnecessarily to imperil the lives of his orew, or of any one. In the present instance, if some brandy could have been procured on board the Emma, it is probable that the lives of more than two out of the five persons re^-cued from the Eury lie > might havo been saved. It will surprise many peo- ple to learn that from a mistaken notion of the ne- cessity of protesting against alcohol drinking in any form the masters of some of our merchant vessels aro seriously endangering human life. A delay of half an hour, as in the present case, may, and pro- bably will, cause death after such exposure as the five survivors of the Eurydice had experienced. Under the circumstances every one, whether a total abstainer or not, must lament this sad example of too much temperance." Another correspondent to the Globe writes : "It seems a strange coincidence in naval nomenclature that both the Orpheus and the Eurydice, almost in siyht of port, under full sad on a Sunday afternoon, should have been wrecked with a loss of almost all hands on board. I do not for a moment imagine that either of these melancholy events has any direct reference to the other, but the connection in name aud the similarity of many circumstances attending their fate strikes me as being at least passing strange. H.M.S. Orpheus was lost at Manakau Head, outside the harbour at Auckland, on Saturday, February 7, 1863. The following extract from " Hollinshed's Chron- icles" may be of interest: " The Loss of the Mary Rose. — .. . After this, 18 Julie, 1545, the Admirall of France, Monsieur Danabutte, hoised up sai les, and with his whole navie came forth into the seas, and arrived on the coa-*t of Sussex before bright Hampstead, and set certaine of his soldiers on land to burne and spoile the countrie. . . . Immediatelie hereupon they made to the point of the Ile of Wight, called Saiut Helens Point, and there in good order upon their arrivall they cast anchor and dailie sent sixteen of their gallics to the verie haven of Portes- mouth. . . . The twentieth of Julie the whole navie of the Englishmen made out, and purposed to set on the Frenchmen, but in setting forward, througb too much folly, one of the King's ships, called the Mary Rose, was drowned in the midst of the haven, by reason that she was overladen with ordinance, and had the ports left open, which were v.-rie low, and the great artillerie unbreached, _o that when the ship should tume, the water entered, and suddenly she suueke. ln her was Sir G< orge Garew, Knight, and foure hundred soldiers under his guiding There escaped not past fortie persons of the whole number."

The Eurydice

So far as we have been able to ascertain — and sounding very, very many, we have not met with a contrary opinion – Islanders are anything but satisfied with the verdict of the Ventnor Jury. Of course they agree with the former portion – that the unfortunate met met with their death by capsizing of the vessel during a squall; but they differ as to the latter– that no blame attaches to anyone aboard. – The boy Fletcher proven to have been the nearest to the truth after all – though Cuddeford was recalled by the Admiralty law agent of Portsmouth to rebut his words– in saying that the ballast of the ill-fated vessel wa her water and stores (both for use), and these lessened on the voyage. Cuddeford said the lower tier of tanks were never

touched but the fact is there was no lower tier ! and the mew using from the only tanks below lightened the ship. However, this ballast question to our mind is not the most serioes one. We believe most persons are firmly of opinion that the ports ought not to have been open, and that so much sail ought not to have been carried, under the circumstances.

Poetry - H.M.S. "EURYDICE," MARCH 24, 1878.

" Eurydice," twice-told, ill-fated name,  
The fullest agony of grief to claim. bride beloved upon her marriage day Boatched ruthlessly by death's stern hand away. Hot her adoring lover's estined bliss Was nearer consummation than was this Two oceans passed, and close at home once more Crazed at in rapture from old England's shore, With all sails set, beneath a sunny sky, Wind and tide favouring. What bliss is nigh Nay, it is well-nigh grasped, that " Welcome Home," When the proud ship plunged into the tomb, on the beauty of her out-spread wings The fatal blast in frenzied fury springs, Without a warning all those noble, brave throbbing hearts are silenced 'neath the wave Without o'er the calm bright sea, . A message called them to eternity. or Orpheus' self for his Eurydice Knew the wide sorrow that felt for thee. How many lives what love as true and strong, Will to their close the grief for thee prolong 'f If Orpheus-like we fain would search the deep For thy dear treasures that -within it sleep, No powei of wealth or talent can attain To bring the warm life gushing back again 'Twould be a cold and shadowy ghost alone That could not for lost love and hope atone. But ! begone, ye mystic shadows dim, Lot holier, brighter faith now point to Him Sleep, loved ones; "Sleep in Jesus;" may you rest Till " the sea yields her dead," then fully blest, May you. with Him, dwell through eternity In that good land where shall be no more sea, tears, no partings, on that blissful shore, Where gallant ship shall pass by nevermore.

THE FOUNDERING OF THE "EURYDICE."

A meeting of the Portsmouth G. neral Committee of the Eurvdiec Relief Fund was held at the Col- lege on Monday afte; noon. The Commander-in- Chief (Admiral Fanshawe, ?? v, ho presided, moved, the ?? (Mr W. Pink) seconded, and it was resolved : M That this committee, while recog- nising the expediency of collecting funds lor those rend, reddestitutr by the foundering ot Her Majesty's ship Eurydice through several agencies as likely "to enrol the largest number of subscribers, are of one opinion, that it is desirable, with a view to the effi- cient administration of the funds collected, that the whole should be distributed through one agency ; and that the machinery of the Patriotic Fund, so enlarged in 1N75, for such objects by a Royal Com- mission, offer the best means for the purpose. That this committee accordingly intends to apply to the j Ro) al Commissioners of the Patriot c Fund to i receive the sum* collected to be administered by the i Roynl Commissioners, uuder the schema adopted for the Captain Fund, excepting such sum, as tbey nii^ht find absolutely n cessary to give for urg nt and immediate relief " It was furtli r determined : " That the Seer, tary be neput d to place himsell in communication wiih the London Eurydic* Relief Committee proi ed over by His Rojal Highness the Duke of Cambridge, with a view" to the joint intent. ons of the two committees btiuii carried out " A correspondent to Thursday's Telegraph, writes : -—What has bt en done at the wreck 'r is the ques- tion heard « u all nid- s, aud it was past 8 o'clock en Wednesday evening before any information was forthcoming, and then it wa.- of the most unsatis- factory kind, 'lhe return of the three tugs and the lighters boded no good, and I regret to ha> e to an- nounce that everything will have to be commenced de novo. Without venturing to say who i=, to blame, there seems to be too much rea on to fear that "come one has blundered." The under-swell, it is said, has increased, aud the tide runs with so much gi eater force that the anchors in use would not held Others of stouter cdibre will have to be taken out, as the joining of the chain cables proved abortive, they were removed. But a flexible steel hawser having been swept under the wreck on Tuesday, it was expected that on Wednesday a second hawser would have been lowered into position, and that cu Thursday the raising of the ship would be com- menced. This, however, cannot be done, for it was deeme I advisable to lift thc hawser, aud it has been brought into harbour. What will be the next move I cannot pretend to say, for confusion seems to pre- vail. Admiral Sir Houston Stewart, Controller ot the Navy, who has appeared upon the scene, may be able to produce order. Ou Wednesda}' a life pinnace was picked up some 20 miles S.W. of St. Catherine, and is supposed to have formed part of the equ'p- uient of the Eurydice. She was brought into har- bour, and handed over to the Admiralty authorities. There is now in the private dock at Portsmouth an iron vessel of some 1,200 tons, which, after having broken her back, was got off Bembridge Ledge by Capt. Coffin, who, in the course of the coining sum- mer, will try to lift the Vanguard. It is said that Capt. Coppin offered to lift the Eurydice, but that his services were declined with thanks The Secretary to the Admiralty forward* a further list (received by telegraph from the Naval Command- ?? on the North- American Station) of men who were discharged from and to her Majesty's sirp Eurydice before she left the West Indies for Eng- land viz. : Discharged from Eurydice to Rover - Wafcer bwindelL, able seaman. Discharged to Wydice from KovW-OharUs Nicholson captain of foretop - j arae8 T DtiVlue , ordinary 8 eaman- and Robert Hiscutt, engineer's cook. y 8eam an , and

To the Editor of the hie of Wight Observer.

Sir.—l think it would have been but bare justice to Mr. Wiltshire, who was deputed to collect money for the Eurydice Fund, had his name appeared, as having b-en s< lected for that office, in th - paragraph heading the list of subscriptions published in your last issue. It appears to me that this was the least, recognition that could be made of his untiring ex- ertions in this charitable work ; a recognition which the public would certainly not have grudged him. Trusting to your courtesy to allow th-se few lines to appear in your widely circulated journal, and enclosing my card, I am, Sir, yours faithfully. FIAT JUSTirCA, RUAT CCELUM.

THE FOUNDERLNG OF THE "EURYDICE."

Operations at the wreck of the Eurydice were resumed on Monday amil rt ousiderable difficulties, the Government arrangements having b°en unsuc- cessful The plan whicn had been adhered to for ab »ut a month has been abandoned, and three private divers, Messrs. F. Davies, A. Sutherland, and Whittaker. ol the firm of Messrs. Sielee and German, the submarine engineers of Loudon, have been retained. Four tugs, the Grinder, Manly aud C.rael appeared on the see ie during the day! An attempt was ma te to descend to the wieok early in tt.e day, but the tide ran o strongly hat it was impossible to do so with safety. Th- divers managed to reach the vessel during the slack tide m tie afternoon, ani exainiueu her oows and i.eadre.r Tne new ?? isto sweep the ship with two steel hawsers and then to lift and carry her between two lighters to the beach. The Portsmouth correspondent of the TdqrapK writing on the 2-3 th inst., says * At the wreck of the -Lurydice to-day the diver** were enabled to make a descent and even walk almost round the ship. The haws -rs were got in position ready for slinging the vessel, and if circumstances coutiuue as favourable as they are now, the attempt to raise her will be made to-morrow [this day, Friday]. Lord H nry Lennox writes ro say, regarding the Eurydice fund, that, as far as is at present known, tin-re are batween 4'J and 50 widows, 170 parents, and from 60 to 70 other relatives who were partly, and in many c ises mainly, dependent upon tho»e who have perished, ann have therefore claims on the fund It is calculated that £20,000 will be required iv ord-r to administer a minimum relief to a 1 the sufferers. Of this sum about ooe half has been collected by thj committee presided ov-r by his Royal Highne-s the Dut-ce of Cambridge, by the Lord Mayor's committee, and by Admit ?? committee at Portsmouth In order to obtain tho amount s ill necess try Lord Henry makes a further earnest app al to the public. The Commissioners of the Royal Patriotic Fund hive undertaken the distribat.ua of the money , n accordance wuh cha powers i conferred upon Uiem by a EoyiJ Ckmmw™ ja loft?. * **

THE EURYDICE DISASTER.

On Wednesday the Admiralty te leg raphed to the officials at Portsmouth Dockyard to the effect that their for ships having observed the increasing disnutiafaction felt by the public, as expressed in the public journals and shared in by themselves, nt the want of success of the operations fur raining the Eurydice, which bad now been sunk since the 24th March, they had instructed the thief-Constructor and the Muster Attendant of Chatham yard (Mr. Baumdors and Capt. Batt) to proceed to Portsmouth, and in consultation with the Chief-Constructor and the Master Attendant of Portsmouth Dockyard, to devise the best means for attaining the object in view as early as possible. Mr. W. B. Robinson, Chief-Constructor at Portsmouth, and Mr. J. C. Froyne, Constructor, proceeded to the wreck on Wednesday to ascertain the character of the operations which have been employed, Ac. A hawser was fastened to the Eurydice's mainmast. and carried to the Malta, which got up full speed. The wreck, however, nnnained itutuovnble. The sweeping of the ie.-el the two 7in. steel hawsers was recommenced, each hawser being capable of sustaining a strain of about 130 tons. On Thursday the two hawsers were fixed in position, round the ship, and on Friday morning the lighters were lashed down to the wreck. The Chatham officials arrived this morning. Directly the tido commenced rising the authorities assembled on the tug arrived at the conclusion that the services of the Pearl and the Rinaldo, supplemented by two mooring lighters, should be brought into requisition, the opinion being entertained that the wreck had to a certain extent become embedded in sand. By Monday it was confidently expected that the wreck would be released from her present meeting. When once she has come away from the bottom, her being floated will almost entirely depend upon the tides, it being expected that each successive tide will enable her to betaken into shore souse 200 yards. When brought above high water mark in Bay she will be pumped out, have her ports closed, and be then ready to float with the rise of the tide. On Saturday the Rinaldo, the Pearl, corvette, and the lighters and tugs were all at hand, the hawsers were made taut, and ono of the two " toggles " which it was determined to plaoo in the pOrts, with hawsers attached, and the ends carried on board lighters, was got into petition. The required rise is 10 feet to 13 feet. it was found that the vested is embedded two feet, and that there is a silting of live feet on the starboard bilge. It was confidently anticipated that the lifting would be accomplished in the course of the next few days. Upwards of a hundred coffins are in readiness to be sent out to receive the bodies found on beard, but whether these will be sufficient cannot of course be known until the divers have penetrated below, which they have not yet been able to do. On Sunday morning she was moved and pat on even keel, and Mrs all thought the end near at haul, but unhappily one of the 7in. steel hawsers gave way; also one of the auxiliaries, so that the work of lifting had to be postponed. It was thought that the two steel hawsers were fully equal to the strain, but on the turn of the tide, the Pearl. on swinging. caused such a tremendous strain on the hawser that it parted. The Rinaldo afterwards let go the hawser attached to her. The weight proved much heavier than expected—up to 300 tons. The Loudon divers have left the scene of the wreck, as some days must elapse before stouter hawsers can be placed in position and the work resented. The divers have found that the ship is much heavier than was supposed being weighted with sand, and bedd nea rly nine feet, the starboard bilge sills being about level with the ground. The officials have determined to supplement the Pearl and Rinaldo with toggles to be placed in the ports of the Eurydice, attached to lighters, four on either side, and to use eight-inch jewel chains. The operations will be resumed when the tide

THE EURYDICE.

Though the result of the operations around the Eurydice on Sunday has produced great disappoint- ment at Portsmouth, now that the officers are in possession of the exact state of the case with which they have to deal, they are, if anything, oven more hopeful than before of being able to raise the uu- | fortunate ship. They are, however, fully cognizant J of the increased difficulty of the task before them, and mea>ur.-s are being promptly taken to meet it! though, as the present tides will not serve, seeing that a ris of 13ft. will be required to pull the ship out of its bed, a fortnight will probably elapse be- fore the operation of lifting can be renewed. Iti the meantime, it is necessary that an ample margin should be allowed for that at present unknown quantity, the dead weight of the ship plus the str tin which will be needed to overcome the suction be- | t-veen the ship and the burrow which she has I formed for her-elf in the sand. Preparations are I being made to resist a strain of some 7 »d tons. This i is more than double the estimated dead-weight of [ the ship in her normal state, before the saturation of her planks and timbers and the introduction of sand mio her ho.d through the main deck lee ports, -A'hich, as already stated, ate on a level with the ground. It wiil also be necessary to provide agtinst un< quai distribution of strains, for it is evilent that where a heavy weight has to be grappled with from purchases suspended from a moving surface or plat- form, great care is requ red so to adjust them as to prevent otu hawser feeling the piueh in advance of the rest, and thus beiug subjected to abnormal ten- sion. After a consultation between the Portsmouth and Chatham dockyard officers, it has been d -cided to supplement the baoyant power of the Pearl and the Rinaldo by dropping "toggles" through the whole ot the ports of the Eurydice and attaching thera to lighters placed four on each side, whereby itis thought, the ship will be lifted evenly and bodily out of her bed. lt has also been deoraed ex- pedient to put more ballast into the Pearl and the Rinaldo in order that tuey may be brought down nearer to their load line, and thus acquire a firmer grasp of the water. The Rinaldo has already been brought from the scene of the wreck into harbour to receive the additional balla- 1 on board. Ei-j-ht- inch jewel chains will also probably be used, ° as" while steel hawsers will resist enormous vertical or horizontal strains, the unfortunate experience of Sunday proved that U*ey are exceedingly liable to part where a nip occurs. But the most important additional factor which will be imported into the operations is the famous Popoff air-bag, which was experimentally tested at Portsmouth in 1870 with reference to us applicability to raise the Vanguard, and which was subsequently put to practical use to assist in raising the Oberon, torpedo ship, from the shoal at the mouth of the harbour. The ba-, which is a combination of cordage, canvas, and vulcanized rubber, measures 22ft. in length and 12ft. in breadth and when inflated to its full extent resembles a cylindrical boiier. The total displacement of the bag is about GO tons, and when introduced through the hatches of the Eurydice, it wiil be able to lift to that amount minus its own weight of 47cwt. 2qrs 14tt>s. Owin^ to the gale which prevailed, nothing was dove on Monday at the wreck. Indeed, it was found necessary to bring the lighters in, one or tw<- of them running great n^\_ of b-ing lost. Two additional divers have been brought from Devon- port to assist in the preliminary operations.

Ventnor. Concert at Ventnor in aid of the Eurydice Distres Fund.

A very excellent entertainment was given last Friday afternoon in the fine coffee room of the Royal Hotel, kindly lent by Mr. Mason, in aid of the Eurydice Distress Fund. We regret to have to say that tho attendance was somewhat limited. The names of those who with the greatest good nature came from Ryde and who did so much to make the concert a success, should have provoked a hearty reception from the dwellers in Ventnor. The programme appended will indicate the character of the entertainment ; and as to the several performers, we do not know that we can say more than that each achieved a perfect success. Miss Wallace, daughter of Col. Wallace, of Ryde, who won the unqualified praise of musical critics by her singing at a concert in the Albert Hall, sang as well as we remember to have heard her, and dispite tho rule to the contrary, was obliged to submit to an encore. Miss Jessie Browne was suffering from a slight cold, yet fully sustained her reputation, and won rounds of applause. Miss Abbott, who is the daughter of a gentleman visiting Ventnor, is a performer of great finish, and was vehemently encored. Master Denton sang very sweetly and added very greatly to the pleasure of the afternoon, winning loud applause and a decided encore when he sang " The little tin soldier." Mr. Perkins, also a visitor, is a thorough musician, and a violinist of the highest order. Thanks cannot be too heartily given given to Miss M. Fowles, who most efficiently discharged the part of accompanist throughout. We should not omit to mention that Mr. Bourne, Mauager of the Isle of Wight Railway, readily sent passes for those ladies and gentleman of Ryde who so kindly gave their help. The programme was as foliows : Pianoforte Solo, Ballade (Opus 23rd), Miss H. D. Abbot. Song, " Che faro senza Eury- dice," Miss Wallace. Soug, ''The Token," Dudley Watkins, Esq. Vioiiu Soio i\ D.

THE WRECK OF THE EURYDICE.
It is now more than six weeks since the Eurydice sank, and, so far from the wreck being nearer the surface, it has become embedded still ueeper iv sand and clay. Three hundred tons was the strain esti- mated at the last attempt to raise the vessel, but experience has been gained by the failure, aud the authorities are providing a lifting power of 1,000 ton- for the next attempt. Toggles are to be inser- ted in each porthole, and hawsers attached to them as weil as passed uuder the ship. The lifting power thus obtained will be tremendous, and, unless some parts of the vessel are carried away by the enor- mous strain, the wreck is almost certain to be lifted. Large sttel hawsers are to be used, and in conse- quence of the increased amount of lift, additional lighters are being prepared. It is prop >sed t• t ke out the fore and inizeu masts before lit ing the ship. Although the extent of the requirements of the relief cannot even now be fully known, it has been proved that 4-i widows and 50 children have been rendered destitute, and appeals for help have come from 57 mothers, six sisters, and five other relatives. On Wednesday a body was found floating close to the wreck. It wa^ placed in a boat, aud lowed by a tug into Portsmouth Harbour. Erom the descrip- tion of the clothing it was evident that the bo ly was that of one of the crew of the Eurydice. It was in an advanced state of decomposition, and therefore perfectly unrecognisable, except by tattoo marks on the breast, or by the clothe-. A diver encountered a body in the fore channel, but in at- tempting to raise it the hand came off, and this is missing from the body. This is the first body re- covered out of the more than 3UO persons who went down with the ill-fated craft more than five weeks since. The corpse was taken to Haslar Hospital. A correspondent writing to a contemporary says : How are we to pronounce the name of the ill-fated vessel which went down in the snow-storm of the 24th ult. ? Classical readers will have no difficulty in deciding on what ought to be the pronunciation, but nine persons out of ten persist in dividing the word into only three syllables, laying the accent on the ultimate, thus— Eu-ry-di'ce. The "correct thing," however, is to call the wrecked vessel Eu-ryd-i-ce making it sound as four syllables and accenting the ante-penultimate, or second syllable. In heathen mythology Eurydic* was the wife of the poet Orpheus. As she fled before Anstasus, who wished to do her violence, she was bitten by a serpent in the grass and died of the wound. Orpheus was so disconsolate that he ventured to go to Hades, where, by the melody of his lyre, he obtained from Piuto the restoration of his wife to life provided he did not look behind him b< fore he came upon earth. He violated the condition; his eagerness to see his wife rendered him forgetful, he looked behind and Eurydice was for ever taken from him. Will the attempt to recover the unfortunate vessel be any more successful?

THE EtTEYDICE. Five bodies (or rather portions) have been recovered during the week. One was a seaman named Taylor, and another Lieut. George Falconer, R.M. The proper pronunciation of the name of the ill.fated ship is Eu.ryd-i-ce, making it sound as four syllables, accenting the second. Operations at the wreck were resumed yesterday (Tuesday). Five toggles have been got in. Both the Pearl and the Rinaldo have been fitted with Merryweather's fire engines, so that, if considered desirable, resort may be had to water ballast. As the lift at the utmost at high water will not exceed lift., eight lifts will probably be required to Beat the sunken vessel into the shallow water in liandown Bay. The beaching of the vessel has been found to be absolutely necessary, as there is insulicient water in the harbour and fairway at high water to enable the Eurydice to be towed in and docked in much below her normal load-line. It has been proposedto dispense with the lighters altogether. in their stead, and to secure additional buoyancy, two old gunboats, the Wave and the swan, are to be employed. Iron. Our prophecy that the " scientific officers" in her Majesty's service wouldfind the Eurydice too much fur them, has, we regret to say, been realised in the meet outuplete manner. There is nu doubt that the " fighting officers" id the Royal Navy are, so far as pluck, English grammar, and good manners are concerned, as exeellent gentlemen as any in the service of Britannia. Vicariously they rule the waves for her, but when submarine operations are to the tore they are wofully at fault. The Eurydice affair is a catalogue of melancholy failure. I Setting aside the vexed question of seamanship as to her lose, her subaqueous record is full of blundering. 'the Admiralty very naturally opined that there ought to be somebody about Portsmouth Dockyard who could raise a sunken ship, and orders were forthwith sent to Portsmouth to lift the Eurydice. As it turned out, this decision was unfortunate. Perhaps it might have been as well to em practical people. Fighting officers always ht well, but they know nothing about raising British Medical Jowled. Both Papal tieorge and the Eurydice sank in tidestsws, with very strong currents, which, Eros first instant, swept constantly through the hatchways and open ports with searebbeg effect ; so it may be surmised that maw ma. attached flexible mimes lying in their emus would be carried away and rolled into deeper waters or on to the shore. It is a remarkabl e feature in the Eurydice that so few of the watch on deck floated away from her, and that so very few corpses have been anywhere found. This may perhaps he explained on the sudden. ni.sx of the struggle for life in the water, and the vortex created by the sinking ship taking them with her to the bottom ; and the stone moons will apply fortiori to the watch off duty and between decks. We think that, by calmly reflecting on such ideas, the minds of those who are now in eager expectation may he brought to a tone conducive to submission to many disappointments on clearance of the vessel. &rim. —lt was asserted that the frigate had drifted of hot. own accord from the position in which she lay.

THE EURYDICE DISASTER.

Late on Friday night a storm set in, and the Rinaldo and the lumps, which were moored near the wreck of the Eurydice, had to slip their cables and make for port, in tow of the Griuder. The iron toggles wnich the divers succeeded in dropping into the ports will have to be removed, ancl th fr places supplied by wooden toggles of greater bearing area, as the former have been found to bend and come cut under the strain of thirteen tons. The Rinaldo was taken back to her moorings on the followiug day, aud the mauly was out at the wreck on Sunday, wheu two additional toggles were put into position. Shortly after mid-day two coast- guardsmen who were on duty at St. Lawrence observed a body floating about three miles out to sea. They at once launched a boat, and succeeded in bringing the body in tow to Ventnor, where it was found to be that of a marine, evidently from the wreck of the Eurydice. Tne f -atures were beyond ideutitication, but it was found that. the body is George Falconer. The body was landed that of on the Isle of Wight, and the Coroner, considering an inquest unnecessary, gave an order for the ?? which took place on Tuesday aft* moon. The b >dy was interred in Ventnor Cemetery with military honours and a large number of the townspeople attended. The Government tugs and divers resumed operations on Monday, but the boisterous weather prevente 1 much progress being made. On Tuesday morning, however, they again proceeded out of harbour to the wreck. As many as a dozen or IG toggles will be used it they cau be successfully introduced into the ports , the hawsers (--till remain rouud the Eurydice, with buoys to pick them up The Pearl was finished for service ou Monday, and can be brought into requisition on whatever day it is thought advisable. A telegraphic statement of the exact rise and fall of the tide is daily sent from the wreck to the dockyard authorities, so that they may know when the tide is likely to serve, and 1 they are putting their plaus into execution with as much dispatch as is practicable, c msidering the difficulties which have to be encountered, aud the unfavourable turn of the weather. These difficulties are increasing every day, the wreck having within the last week or ten days sunk further in the mud by several ! feet. On Tuesday morning, about 11 o'clock, John • Gawn, a fisherman of Portsmouth, while near tne j Warner light, picked up the body of a seaman j belonging to the Eurydice. Just before that time J George Comer, a fisherman, of Gosport, had picked | up another body near the same spot. Both bodies ; were towed into harbour and were taken to the [ Gosport Coastguard statiou, to which place a haud- i cart and coffins were conveyed from Ha^lar Hospital, j and the bodies were placed in them and taken to the dead-house at that place. One of the bodies was that of a young man whose name is supposed to be William Hendy. Both bodies arc in a very advanced stage of decomposition. The Duke aud Duchess of Edinburgh liave for- warded to the Lord Mayor a donation of £ 100 to war .s the support of the widows, orphaus, and dependant relatives of the men who lost their lives in the Eurydice. Mr. E. J. Physick, sculptor, has been commissioned to execute the monument m memory of Lieut. Frank Tabor, R.N., who was picked up in an exhausted condition, and expired shortly after the sinking of H M.S. Eurydice. The memorial will be erected over the^ grave in Cheam churchyard, fcmrry, and the i de ign prepared by Mr L'h^sick is singularly ap- propriate as a memento of the sad circumstances which caused its erection.

THE EURYDICE Tar Ettarnms.—Exactly two mouths had elapsed last Sunday since the capsising of the Eurydice, which lies buried still deeper in the sandy bottom. defying the ingenuity of the otlicials and the vast store of appliances which have been brought into requsition for the purpose of raising the wreck. Anxiety as to the liftiug of the ill-fated ship continues, and doubts are expressed as to whether it will ever to 010 surface unless blown up—an idea most repugnant to those having friends on heard. Work was attempted again on Sun. day, but the tugs had to return in consequence of the high wind blowing. The divers succeeded on Saturday in inserting a toggle into the lee side of the ship. Several more bodies have been picked up on the Sussex coast. A portion of the wreckage of this weasel has been washed ashore at itottingdean, and on Friday the bodies of two of the seamen wets discovered in the sea near Salttk•an. They had evidently been in the water for a considerable time, the free and hands being eaten away. and they presented altogether a terribly decomposed and shock in 4 appearance. The clothing on the bodies were r.spectivel) marked "6. Gordon" and "A. Dames. Ou eriday evening the body of another seaman was picked up at Lancing. The body was in a very decomposed state, especially about the extremities. The name "J. Appledore" was marked on the guernsey under the collar. Another body was picked up at Selsey on Monday, but identification was impossible in consequence of the state in which it was discovered. rii. Ar.y and Nary Oautte remarks :—The statement made by a weekly contemporary that " the efforts made by the Admiralty to raise the Eurydice arff nothing more than what is in theatrical parlance termed' gag'—that in fact, they have never seriously intended to raise her •—is nothing leas than fiction. The Admiralty fully intended to raise the ship, and the fault of the whole work has been that those! entrusted with the preparations under-estimated the difficulties, and apparently did not take pains to ascertain what kind of bottom she was resting on. That she may never be raised is not now at all beyond belief, but it will be owing to error and not design if she never floats again. We are inclined to the opinion of many who ought to know something of the matter, that the Eurydice will never be raised. She would, doubtless, have been blown up long ago, but for the effect this would have had on tit, *dines of the relatives of the unfortunate men, for the afteoopt to raise has cost perhaps ninth as two three buryiliom would ; and even if she were got up she would not be worth anything. We believe she will remain till all the bodies have disappeared, and then a charge of dynamite will cause their temporary coffin to disappear also. fns Cuter CONSTRUCTOR ON THE ErRYVICE, &e.—The chief constructor of the l'uckyard (Mr. W.

OPENING OP THE NEW PIER.

Sandown was en fete on Wednesday, the day fixed for the op ning of the new pi^r, and every one seemed impressed with the fact that th>; event was j one of no ordinary importance in the history of th- 1 litrle town. Lady Oglander very kindly consented to petform the opening ceremony, but so unpropiti- ous was the weather at the beginning of the day j that for some time it was doubtful whether a post- j ponemenfc Avould not be necessary. The rain fell all the morning without ceasing, a*nd of course made the roads in the neighbourhood of the pier dirty and muddy ; but, as the hour fixed for the cerenv ny ap- proached, the t-ky commenced clearing, and by o o'clock it was tolerably fine. A considerable num- ber of persona then began to flock to the pier, the j approaches to which were decorated with banners and flags. Across the street which Lady Oglander would have to pass was stretched a banner, bearing the arms of the Oglander family and the motto "Server Mania Vitre," on each side of which was the word " Welcome." Above the street leading to the pier was a banner bearing the words "Success to the Pier," and over the pier gates another, bid- ding all " Welcome." There was also plenty of bunting about, a number of poles being placed at regular intervals en both sides of the pier, and each carrying a gay flag. With respect to the pier itself, which next claims our notice, it must not be under- stood that it is actually finished. Only a portion of the structure — half the total length contemplated — is finishe. , but of course this is suflirient to give a good ider. of its general effect, and makes a very nice promenade. Unlike the piers we have seen else- where, the seats run down the whole length. From the pierhead can be obtained capital views, not only seaward but of the c iffs, sands, and general b'cenery of the interior of the Island. The pi? r looks a very lig't structure — nn. omfortably so, in fact. The iron piles on which it rests are so slight, and their distance one from the oth^r is so great, as to lead one to doubt whether it will be found sufficiently strong to withstand the winter waves Avhieh roll into the bay. This uncomfortable feeling was in- tensified by the appearance of a. wreck close at hand — the John Douse— highly suggestive of the stormy waters which the structure will have to withstand ; while fun her out to sea, and almost in line with the hi ad of the pier, was another di.-m.al sight — the ma>ts of the wreck of the Eurydice, still beneath the waters, and still holding many a score of the bodies of brave young tars These were two things highly suggestive of what the winds and waves can do about here. We suppose, however, that the light- ness of the pier just at the parts which are finished does not matter, and doubtless the structure will be ma le more substantial a-» it reaches that portion of the shore where the full fury of the waves will be c countered. However, a pier seems to be a neces- sity for bandown, and we congratulate the inhabi- tants of the little town upon their energy and evi- dent determination to improve the place. THE OPENING CEREMONY. Shortly after 1 o'clock the townspeople began to flock to the pier. A number of the n^ ember d of the Nuuwrll Volunteers were drawn up on each side of the pier gates, as a sort of gu ird of honour, under the command ot their popular young captain (A. Brook Leeds, Esq.) and Lieut P uud, while the band was stationed at the end of the pier to add harmony to the proceedings. Amongst those assem- bled at the pier gates to welcome Lady Oglander on her arrival were F. Pittis, E.-q (Mayor of Newport), Col. (Jurrie (chairmau of the VV-ntnor Local Board), Mr. Walter Mew (chairman of the Sandowu Local Board), W. 11. Wooldridge, Esq (clerk to the Local Board), Mr. Eldridge (town clerk of Newport), the Rev. YV. M. Harrison, Dumpier Child, Esq , and the following members of the Sandown Local Board : Dr. Bulbeck, Messrs. Linn Id, Love, J. K. Hollis, Warne, Pelley, and Box. L idy Oglander arrived punctually at the time fixed, accompanied by Major Leeds, and on alighting from her carriage was re- ceived by Mr. Wooldridge, who introduced the Chairman and members of the Sandown Local Board to her ladyship. Mr. Walter Mew (chairman) then -topped torward and presented h°r ladyship with an address from the Board In doing so he expressed trie great pleasure he felt in seeing her ladyship present, and thauked her for the interest she had al- ways taken in Sandown, at the same time express- ing the hope that she would long be spared to them. Mr. Wooldridge then reai the address, which was handsomely engrossed on vellum, an I signed by 155 ratepayers and inhabitants of the district. It was as follows : To Lady Oglander, Nunwell Park, Isle of Wight. Madam, — ?? tuo Local B ard of the disrrict of San- duwu, ?? Wi^ht, and the undersigned ratepayers md mhnbitants of the district, beg respectfully to express the great pleasure and giatification whi h it gives us to •<ee your ladyship taking p.ut in, and inaugurating; the .pening of a Pier in taudown. We are wed as-ured that your ladyship at all times takes aa interest in all ■natters connected with the pubac welfare of Sandown and its inhabitants ; knowing, as we do, the readiness and liberality with which yo-i have always cunrnbur d ro, and assisted ail chariiable, and other local undertak- ings, we trust that your ladyship may long be spared aud be a^le to assist, aud participate in all public erne - prises which may c >nduce to the prosperity of the town ■>f Sandowu, in which, as Lidy of the Manor, we f«el sure you wi.l alwa}s have a deep and sincere in'treat. With ever expression of respect aud estee v, We are, your ladyship's faithful servants, Walter Mew, Chairman. The Common Seal of the Local B ard of Sand wn. was affixed, this 27th day uf May, 1873, in pursuance of a resolution unanimously passed at a special meeting, held oi the 24 'h day of May, 1878, in the presence of Mr. H. Wooldridge, clerk to the B ard. Leaning on the arm of .Major Leeds, her ladyship then walked to the end of tho pier, which had been carpeted for the occasion. Here she was introduced to the chairman and directors of the Pier Company Her ladyship having bri fly declared the pier open, Mr. Jonathan Jollitfe, the chairman of the company, stepped forward and presented her ladyship with. ano her address. He expl lined that the company had a hard struggle to get the pier completed so far, but they hoped to be able to make the structure double its present length, and to place a lifeboat at the end. It would then be very useful for yachts aud steamers, which would be able to land passen- gers here. He then presented the address, which was also engrossed on vellum, and read as follows : To Lady Oglauder, N unwell Ptrk. Isle . f VVi^ht. Madam, — The chairman and directors of the Sandown Pier Uoinp-iuy, heg to welcome your ladysuip .n this, to them, important occasion, and at the same time ex- press iheir sincere thanks f>r your kindness in consent- ing to preside a' the opening of the pier. It is only alter having overcome many difficulties, and even local 'Pposilion, that the directors have at length succeeded iv coiupleiing the iirst s«oti- >n of the pier, so as to permit the same to be opened for the use of 'he public. However, they hope to receive such pecuniary assistance from residents, owners nf property, and oihi-ra inceresied in the welfare of Saudowu., as may enable them 'o Complete the original design, and carry out the pier to ir» full lengih of 650 teet, being nearly double the length of the p.nion already constructed, and so kindly opened by >our ladyship. — The directors are sure thatthe pier will atford a pleasaut and agreeable promenade, and prove a source of attraction to the towa of Sand >wu and its vii.ors; and they venture also to hope that it may ultimately prov • useful, not only for purp -ses of recrea- tion, but also a station from which a lifeboat may bo launched. R cent sad events tiut have taken place in tuc bay deepen the conviction that Sandown will prove a most iin port-in t stati in foi a lifeb >at. ?? the carrying I out so laudable an object the directors can only trust to the libeniliiy and sympathy of the public geuernlly — j Again thanking y>>ur ladyship tor the k'ud interest you j have shown in the w rk the directors have in hand by J your presence here to-day, and with every good wish for ! your welfare and happiness, We beg to remain, Your ladyship's obedient aud fitiihful oervants Jonathan Jo luff e, KicHA.tD Dampiek Child, George Pelley, James Kennington. The seal of the Sandown Pier Company (Limited) was affixed this 28th day of May, 1878, in pursuance of a resolution duly parsed at a meeting of the directors ia the presence of W. H. Wouldridge, secretary. This portion of the ceremony concluded, Miss Brandt ; stepped forward, and, on behalf of the d-rtctors presented her ladyship with a very handsome bou- quet. Her ladyship briefly replied as follows; "Mr , Chairman and gentleman oi the Sandown Locai Board and gentlemen of the Sandown Pier Company -I thank you v ry much for the kind and gratify- ! ing reeepti-m you have given me. It atf-rds me at I ail times siucere pleasure to assist iv any way in , promoting the prosperity oi" Sandown, and I trus. the undertakii.g you have so biiccts.-fully curried out aud inaugurated this day may prove one of the many means of adding to the attractions of the place, and tin additional source of heakh and enjoyment to ; visitors and iiihitbi>:m r s alike. ' Hearty h»-ers wer i th n given for hey Jady>hip, and a number ot the yeutl9m«a present having been introduced tv her j *© procession again went up the pier; her ladyship I a L A1 « l ]>r Leeds re-entered their carringe, and drove | oft amidst the loud cheers of the assembled specta- | tow. This concluded the ceremony, which was fol- I lowed by A B.VNQUBT, which took pla".o at half-past 5, in the Town Hall, where about 70 gnntl-men sat down to the excellent repast provided. The chair was taken by Mr. Jon. ! Jolliffe, and the viee-chair by Mr. Walter Maw; : there being also present Capt. Brook Leeda, Lieut'. i Pound, Col. Currie, Rev. W. M. Harrison, Mr. W. i H. Wooldridge, Col. Brandt, Mr. F. Pitt is, Mr. F. Pittas, jun., Mr. T. H. Urry, Mr. W. H. Barton, Mr. C. Cr. Vincent, Dr. Meerea, Mr. Binn» (engineer), I Mr. D. Mitchell, Mr. Linfield, Mr. J. K. Hotiis, Mr. ! L. H. Saunders, Mr. Theodore Saunders, &c. After ! the removal of the cloth, Mr. Wooldeidoe read letters of apology from Mr. ! Baillie Cochrane, M.P. (who was unable to attend ! owing to the state of his health), the Mayors of I Rydo, Yarmouth ?? and Andover, Mr. F. White Popham, Col. Calthorpe, and others. The Chairman briefly proposed tho usual loyal toasts, which were heartily responded to. He then, proposed "The Army, Navy, and Reserve Forces," coupling with the toast the names of CoL Currie, Col. Brandt, and Capt. Brooke Leeds. Col Currik congratulated those present upon adding a pier to the attractions of Sandown ; and then, .speaking to the toast, said he had seen a great deal of war, and what he had aeen of its horrors led him to hope that peace would be maintained, and if it was maintained with honour to the country it J would be the brightest star in the escutcheon of tho j noble lord who now presided over the destinies of the country (applause). Col. Brandt, who also responded, was suro that in the present unfortunate discussion England would do her be&t to be on the right side, and should it end in war the Army, who had never yet been backward when called on, would do va best (applause). God forbid it should end in bloodshed, for he was sure no Englishman wished to *ee that ; all they wished was to see justice and right done (applause). If we did have a peace he hoped it would not be a patijhed-up peac >, but that the question would now be so .settled that there could be no chance of its be- ing brought forward again (applause). Capf. Brook* Leeds, in responding for the Volun- | teers, si id that the corps he commanded owed a great deal to Sandown, and the numbers who had ; joined them from that town enabled them to muater more strongly in proportion than the corps belong- ing to large and important towns. They would not be able to keep the corps up to this position without the help of Sandown. They had ju.st drafted l» Sandown men into the corps, and their band was composed five-tenths of Sandown men. T^eir corps then was virtually, except in name, a Sandown corps. The Volunteers as a body had no politics, and were always ready to do their duty it calkd on ; but they could not forget that, in spite of the many matters of importance which our present Govern- ment had to attend to, they had remembered tho Volunteers. A Volunteer commission had been ap- pointed to take into consideration the wants and requirements of the force. Although the Volunteers hnd their grant there were many other things re- quir d, which would no doubt be supplied (applause). Mr. Daxpier Guild proposed M The Bishop and Clergy of the Diocese and the Ministers of all De- nominations." In spire of certain difference* he thought the Church had the hearty good wishes of all true Englishmen. After regretting the abseuce of the Vicar, he coupled with the toast the names of the Rev. W. M. Harrison to respond for the Bishop and clergy, and the Rev. Mr. King for the ministers of other denomination-!. The Rev. W. M. Harrison said he was extremely pleased to be present on such an auspicious day for Sandown, and he wished their new institution every success. Mi-. Dampier Child had alluded to diffe- rences of opinion in the Church, but he asked where they did not find differences of opinion. It was no when he was a boy, and he supposed always would be i-o ; but he believed that, in spite of differences of opinion, his brethren of the Church and those amongst the Nonconformists were ceming more into accord, and beginning to see that there was not such a great gulf between them but what they could shake hands ever it. He hoped they would give them credit for that, and would see that though they were parsons on Sunday they had their hearty sympathy on all occasions. The Rev. Mr. Kino said he trusted that ministers of all denominations were beginning to see that they were building on one great foundation, and all endeavouring to inculcate one njble principle — giod will towards men. He was very pleased to be present on t-uch an occasion. Having been intimately associated with Saudown for a great number of years in greatly rejoiced him to see its increasing P'O-perity. He believed the construction of the new pier wonld prove a great thing for Sandown, and he hoped that, when completed, it would be crowned with success. Mr. Peixey in eulogistic terms proposed the health of Lady Oglander, who always took such interest in the town, and had given £10 towards the expenses of the day (loud applause and cheers). Capt. Le-.ds re-ponded, and said he wished to tell them what Mr. Wooldridge evidently forgot, that his father, Major Leeds, was unable to be present, and had only been able to attend that afternoon at s >me ri.-ik to himself, for he was very far from well. He thanked them for the hearty way in which tho toast was proposed and received. It was unnecessary for him to dilute on the kindness of Lady Oglander. One could not praise one's own relations very well, but he thought they would remember that it was a very difficult matter for any lady to take part in public matters. When, however, Lady Oglander was asked to open the pier, she at once complied, and although the day was not everything which wished, she came and went through the ceremony (applause). It was a pleasmre foe her to do anything to help Sandown. He then thanked them heartily on her behalf. Mr. L. H. Saumdhrs proposed " Success and Prosperity to the Sandown Pier." He should like to say a few words on the subject, which, as he wad a resident outside Sandown, he hoped would be ac- cepted in all sincerity. The pier so far had been built by a mere handful of men. Fewer men than we** assembled in that room had found the capital necessary to build what was nothing less than an institution — the pier which they had seen so ably opened by Lady Ox lander that day, and he trusted that all those present, who had not yet done so, had decided to become shareholders. The capital re- quired was £6,0 00, in 1,200 shares of £5 each, to build a pier 6o0 feet long, with the object, not only of benefiting the resi ieuts, but of bringing an ad- ditional number of visitors to Sandown. Perceiving the advantages of such a pier a number of the gen- tlemen present had put their hands in their pockets, and mor- than half the capital required had already been subscribed. He thought they ought not to be backward now, for he believed greater profit would accrue uow than at the commencement. The pier as at. pr -sent fiui.-hed was 3-50 feet lonj? and 20 feet wide, and it possessed one advantage which they did not often see. He had been on a great many piers*, and he found seats generally rather scarce, but on the Sandown pier he noticed th-tt *eats ran from end to end, and there was plenty of room for those who could not walk about. He thought that arrange- ment would greatly contribute to the success of the undertaking. All that was wanted now was the means tor providing the remainder of the money re- quired, ami for an outlay of another £2,500 or so they would be able to complete the pier to the length he had mentioned, so that th-y woull always have nine or ten teet of water at the end of the pier, suf- ficient tor steamers to come alongside at all times and take up or put down excursionists. Although they had a ralway to Sandown they wanted some- thing more— accommodation by water, and he hoped to fin'1 no difficulty in doing that. He believed it wasafuctthatallth^prel miuary expensesof thiacom- pany—-getting the Bill in Parliament, <fcc— in f*ct, all their Parliamentary expenst- s, were covered by a cheque for £200 That was sufficient to show that there was no promotion money paid, and he thought such a company, with responsible directors and not overweighted, must be a success. The directors, in addition to the ldige amount of shares they had token, rathe;- than open tho pier with any liability upon it, had given their names and taken a personal liability for £200 each beyond their holding. That showed the sort of opinion the directors had of »ho | undertaking. In proposing rhe to .st he I oped that every Sandown man would take a share. — The toast was received with three times three. The Cii-UKXAX said they were going to carry on the undertaking in an honest, straightforward way and if they only revived support They would nuke the pier oue of the k>t litile properties in the U Qo f Wight. He had upeut a great tkal of tim« and m >ney on the Newport Junction Kail way, and if that

Unconscious of the danger nearbsforethe sundown dip  
Resealing to the light of day, 'midst white sails spread around,  
Youth's gall a nt form and manhood strong, that now in death are found.  
Dread cloud of woe which overcabt their brightest home in night,

THE EURYDICE.

In the House of Lords on Monday, Lord Dorchester asked Her Majesty's Government whether any and, if -o, what st-ps had been taken since a first attempt, that f.til.d, to raise H.MS. Eurydice, sunk off Dunnose on the 24th March last ; whether there had been any consultations relating thereto between the dockyard and other naval au- thorities, and whether any eminent engineers, civil or military, had been invited to give their opinions ; also whether any firms, such as " The Steamship Salvage Company" or other persons experienced in such matters, had been invited to afford assistance towards or to tender for raiding the ve.-sel ; and whether thfre was any objection to produce any papers relating thereto. The noble lord said that there were three or four large firms in this country with special appliances for raising ships.' One of them had entered into a contract to raise the Van- guard. Within four miles of where thfi Eurydic; was lying a large ship had been raised by one of these firms He believed that competent authorities denounced the means taken f>r raising the Eurydice, and it was scarcely ere itable to the first maritime Power in the world that the ship should have been lying for ten weeks in ten fathoms of water. Lord Elphinstone, before answering the question just put to him, wished, in reply to an enqui y made by a noble lord on Friday night, to say that there was to be no naval review off Portsmouth this week As to the question of the noble lord (Lord Dorches- ter), he was not surprised ..t it. Many oersons who were interested in the matter were imperfectly ac- quainted with what was doing and had been done. They were unaware of the difficuli ies to be overcome, and expressed surprise at the apparent slow progress made in raising the Eurydice. He was very glad ihe noble lord had given him an opportunity of ex- plaining at somewhat greater length than on previ- ous occasions the difficulties the naval authorities had had to contend against. The question embraced four distinct subjects. With regard to papers, there were really none, exct.pt a shoo; daily journal kept by the officer in charge of working pa 1 ties. This would show bf-tter than any words of his the diffi- culties which had to be encountered. It was made up to the v;9th ult., and would show that out of the b7 days since the ship sank the working had only been able to work during portions < f 27 days, some- times for not more than one or two hours out of th>* 24. During 40 days they ha I been unable to work at all on account of the weather. The divers had only been able to work 80 hours in all The lighters had to slip their moorings and run into harbour for shelter no fewer than 1 1 times, and had to slip again last Saturday. There was no objection to laying that journal on the table. Ho thought he mentioned on a iormer occasion that the Admiralty decided from the first that the business of raiding the liurydice should be entrusted to the dockyard au- thorities at Portsmouth, where there was a most efficient staff of officers, both scientific and practical, who meet in consultation almost daily. They were presided over by the Admiral Superintendent, Ad- miral Fol^y, who was assisted by the Chief Con struetor, Mr. Kobin-on ; Captain Pokinghorne, Master Attendant ; Captain Bart, Master Attendant of Chatham dockyard, who was employed for a con- siderable lime in conn c?ion with the operations at the wreck of the Vanguard; Captain Dathan, Cap- tain Moss, and Captain Palme", >taff Commanders it would be difficult to get together a stronger or a better Board. They were all agreed in thinking that under the circumstances of the case, and with the appliances at their disposal, no plan could be adopted more likely to ensure success than the one they were at present endeavouring to carry out. They were animated with but one desire, and that was to suc- ceed, and no exertions were being spared in order to attain that result. The Admiralty had not invited ■he opinio-. of any civil engineer. The matter whs one which the scientific tin 1 the pracicil skill the Department ha<i at irs disposal at Portsmouth dock- yard was quite able to deal, and he very much doubted whether there was any civil engineer who had had any experience whatever in raising weight* such as that with which the authorities had to deal and under similar circumstances He n^ed scarcely add that it had not been felt necessary to invite the opinion of any military men. For the same reasons as those which he had already mentioned, they had not invited the assistance of the 6t- am«hip Salvage Company or any person experienced in raising ves- sels, and he was not aware that either the Steamship Salvage Company or, indeed, any other person had any experience in raising vessels under the circum- stances of the present case. There were cases of ships having been saved, and, indeed, of having been raised in smooth water and out of a strong tide- way, but there was no instance on record of a ship having been raised under circumstances similar to or in any approaching those in which the Eurydice was placed The only case at all resembling the present was that of H.M.S. Pincher, a schooner of 180 tons, sunk in 14 fathoms of water off the Owers, in 1837, and it w>>B four months before they succeeded in getting her into Portsmouth harbour. The Admiralty had been inundated with offers. Now, as to the steps which were being tak^-n, he would remark that they had to deal with a deadweight of between 400 ami tons, lying 12 fathoms below water in a strong tideway, with v. current running between four and f<ix kuots an hour, and with slack water varyin" from 30 to 90 minutes. Indeed, it would be difficult to find a spot on the whole coast of Great Britain where greater difficulties existed in regard to such an operation — difficulties not only below water on account of the tide, but also difficulties above wate on account of the tide and the weather combined for a nasty sea got up at that spot very quickly with the slightest provocation. The Eurydice sank on the 24th March, and it was not until the 27th April that they were able to make an attempt to move che wreck. They did so by means of two corvettes — the Rinaldo and ihe Pearl — which had been tempo- rarily converted into lighters That attempt failed on account of the breaking of one of the hawsers, and then, after consnltation on the part of the Board to which he had referred, it was determined by the authorities at Portsmouth to adopt what might be called tho over-lift principle, which simply meant that, instead of placing the lighters round the sunken ship as before, they would be placed immediately over her. They would b? attached to the wreck by eight steel hawsers toggelled through her main-deck poits, and six jewel hawsers woul 1 also be passed round the ship. In addition to that, it was intended to make uso of her two bower cables, and also of the Russian air bag, which had a lifting capacity of 40 tons. That would give some idea, of the difficulties which had to be overcome No f^wer than 1G dif- ferent attachments had to be made, and an equal strain brought to bear upon them all. Should it come on to blow, or any Bea get up, those attach ments.mu.xt all be slacked and probably let go, the lighters would have to seek shelter in p<>rt, as they had had to do no fewer than 1 1 times already, and the whole work would have to be begun ever again when the weather settled. But that was not all. It was supposed that the bottom where tho Eurydice sank was hard ground, and so it was. There was a crust of h .rd around, but below that was soft, fine sand. It would appear that the whip struck the ground with -reat force, for her starboard cathead was knocked away and a portion of her k*-el was sticking out under her stern. The result was that the hard crust was broken, and the ship had been gradually settling in the soft sand. During the late gales she was settling bt the rate of 2in. a day Fortunately she was not settling any more at pre- sent. But she was now lUft. in the sand, and out of that hole she had to be lifted and placed upon a new bed. That once done the main difficulties would be practically overcome ; and if the weather would only hold up he hoped the work miirht soon be successfully accomplished, although he was bound to add that he no longer looked upon it as in any way a mutter of certainty. But this he would say, that net nil the "eminent engineers," civil or eve! military, aided by the Steamship Salvage Company or any private firm, could have hastened the raisin-' of the Eurydice by one hour. In conclusion, he had a ]>lan cf the manner in which it was souo-ht to raise the ship that he would be happy to show the noble lord. Lord Dorchester asked whether the attempt to raise her would be more to-morrow. Lord Elphinstone said that would depend entirely on the weather. J

TUE EUBYDICE.

Conettnnom eyries Imo torra—On Wednesday last Mr. Edgar tioble, one of the coroners for Dante, teaclothsl the inquiries into the death of the unfortunate men drowned in the Eurydice. The evhleneo sem confined to that of the survivors, Cuddiford and the boy Sydney Fletcher. There narratives were subetantially the samosa the admitted by them at previous inquiries. Some new facts, however, were Avowed. Clekliferd stated that there was not the slightest ioditation of the spoilt rowing on before the Ship stank, and he did not thiult the wind headed her during the whole time. To the lust the captain mire his orders in a clear and distinct voice, and at the time the ship went down all the ports were open ex c ept tan. They were owned in the forenoon by the acres of the mate of the deck, and the ship at the time she struck was going at about eight knots. From the time the order wax given to ehorten sail to the time she heeled over about six minutes elapsed. From the :hue she heeled over to going down was only a minute, The captain was on deck the whole of the afternoon, and iu witness's opinion everp bite: was done to save the ship. He believed that none of the four guns broke loose. The ship was more lively than usual from the amount of water and provisions but if they had commuted all the water the ship would have been properly ballasted. lie did not believe that Captain Hare was aware that the ports were open. Considering the state of the weather be wane( opinion that the ship was in a wife condition. She was not under too great a prect of trail previous to the storm. Mr. (Afford, a sub-lieutenant, was at the wheel, but there was always a quartermaster there. As a seaman of 21 pars' e xperience, he believed that no blame attached to either officers or men for the loss of the ship. The Coroner, in concluding the inquiry, said the Admiralty did not propose to offer any scientific evidence. It would be for the jury to my whether the captain had caused a proper look-out to kept, because if he had nut it would amount to a neglect of duty, for which he would have had to answer had ho survived. The jury returned a verdict to the effect that the deceased came to their deaths by drowning through the foundering of the Eurydice, but that no blame attached to the captain, fficers. or crew. Another body has been recovered from the wreck—that of C. Wilkins, one of the crew, found found in the forechains. In opening the en: quiry, the Coroner (E. Goble, Esq.) observed that the body upon which evidence would be given was supposed to be orte of the crew, of the Eurydice, and his clothes were marked "C. Wilkins." It would be the duty of the jury to ins nine whether the indentity of the deceased' had been proved to their satisfaction, and also to ascertain the cause of death. It was nut his intention at present to go into any further in. quiry. They haul received the verdict of two juries with regard to this catastrophe, and therefore all they need now do was to prove the identity of the body and find the comet of &nth. eiterge foreman of the laborers at the Hospital, said the body was brought to the ads petal thattlay by some laborers of the Dockyard. Ile gave formal evidence as to the chattel which were worn by the decreased, and which Foetid his identity, the name being on the waistband and trousers. The deceased was picked up in the for...chains of Ii.M.S Eurydice. inspector-General Doraville handed in the card trout the Admiralty, stating that C. Wilkins was a seawall on beard the Eurydice —The inquiry was adjourned. During the last few days of fine weather co, .iderable rrogress has been made at the wreck, hoth the wizen and fore masts having been pulled out by the tugs and a spaee cleared for the attachment of the lifting ships. On Tueb. day morning the last of the four lighters was towed out of liArbour to the wreck, and should I nc preaent weather continue, an at. empt to raise the Lurytlieu will ho made to. Tire loss of the Eurydice has set thousands of pens agoing,and many thonsandsof tongues. Many inn varied are the opinions as to the easee of the melaneholy disaster, and it is some satisfaction—mournful it is true—to know that in the opinion of the jury which has enquired into the loss of the Eurydice. the disaster was the result of an accideut and no blame can be attached to the captain or any of the officers or men under him. It was the first thought that the vessel under too great a press of canvas, seeing what the weather was before the squall came on; but the evidence showed that there were two watches, with at least a hundred men in each, that the watch on the deck at the time was plenty to manage the ship, and that had there been more men they would have been in each other's way. Too often disasters of this kind are caused becama. some blundered," hut in this instance everything was done that human foresight and judgment eould direct, and the collision must be attributed solely to a meet direful "freak " Nature, for which the unfortunate victims (-linnet be held responsible. The only consolation is that no one MD be blamed but Nature herself, who cannot he hell amenable to the British laws rind constitution. Bow TO Rates VESSELS. — Writing with regard to the unsuccessful attempts to raise the Eq. !pike, a correspondent says :—.% few yours ago, the Workington, a full-rigged ship of 2,000 tons, laden with (vials, andou tire, was scuttled in the roads, and settled into soft mud, that her topsail yards were only visible above the water. She was bought bye French. man. He at once secured all her top-hamper for staging on which to erect purchases (and did not strip her, as the Eurydice was stripped) to discharge her cargo with and work his divers' pumps from. He had strong Pampero winds, and three or four knot currents to contend against ; however, by working both day and night, and in as bad and exposed position as though the ship had been off the lsle of Wight, he discharged all the cargo of coals, then commenced to fill the hold with wine casks, which were stored below by six divers. The casks had an inch hole bored in each head, then tilled with water and a long spigot placed in the holes, then slung in a chain lowered to the divers (the chains helping to sink the cask) and placed into position by them ; when there they had only to take out both plugs, insert the end of the air nozzle into one hole and blow the water out by the other, then pluugg them both up, when the cask would be tilled with air. Upon one calm day they thus placed 250 casks. They stuck to the job for nine weeks, and brought the ship out of her Led in which she had settled 13 feet deep into the harbour. The tremendous force of the united efforts of the casks had burst her upper deek and so strained her deck beams that they had to be taken out and repaired. The ship, under the name of Perteno, is now afloat, and has made many profitable voyages for her owner. Now, the divers told no they experienced no difficulty while working in the hold from current or rough water. but were only troubled by the darkness and the slippery settlements left on all footing by the sand delimits, of which the hold had at least fifty tons, and this had to be lifted with the iron hull of the ship, iron lower masts, bowsprit, lower yards, and all deckgear. lu another case a wooden brig was cut down by a steamer to the water's edge, and was treated in a like manner, only that the immense hole in her aide had to le planked and covered with canvas. She was succeed- Wily brought into harbour, although seven tailed outside when she went down, and in the channel where the whole force of the river is constantly running at tour to fourandsa-half knots, and not three days without a blow more or less severe.

THE EURYDICE.

In the House of Commons on Monday, Mr. David Jenkins said I wish to ask the First Lord of the Admiralty when it is intended to hold a naval inquiry into the lows of her Majesty's ship Eurydice; how it is proposed that the court should be constituted ; and whether be has considered if it would be advantageous to the public service that one or two experts, other than olllcers in her Majesty's navy, should form part of the oourt : and, whether he inform the House what weight of ballast was put on board when this ship was last cow. miasmic& and of what it consisted; if the water in tanks or any portion of the other stores was relied upon to ensure her stability ; and, if so, what were the nature and weight of such stores. Mr. W.li. Smith said the court-martial, in accordance with the Navy Discipline Act, has been delayed simply for the purpose of obtain. ing some valuable evidence as to the condition of the ship before she sank, which it was expected would be forthcoming when the ship was raised. The Hoard do not permit experts to be placed upon the court, but the court can any one they choose in order to obtain evidence. The weight of iron ballast the Eurydice carried was 30 tons, the same as she carried previously. As to the last part of the second question, namely, that with reference to water ballast and stores, that will he the subject of inquiry before the court, and it is one to which I cannot give an answer. Mr. D. Jenkins gave notice that on a future day he should call attention to the subject. Mr. Millie Cochrane. M.P. for the isle of Wight, also asked the First Lord of the Ad. miralty whether, as it seemed impossible to raise the Eurydice, it would not ho better to place a buoy over the place where she lies, with souse memorial of the gallant men who perished there. Mr. W. H. Smith : It is not considered to be impossible to raise the ship, and further attempts will he made to do so next spring tides, if the weather permits. To place a Imo) over the wreck permanently would ho a serious obstruction to navigation. (Hear, hem.) The salvage operations at the wreek have made considerable progress, favored by a continuance of floe weather, and from Monday till Friday the divers will only be engaged in cutting away su:h running gear as would be likely to drag on the ground when the ship is raised. The Eurydice has now beenswept inth four 8-inch steel hawsers, and heavy toggles, with double wire strops, have been introduced into the ports. To these strops 1) inch chain pendants have been shackled on, and when the lift it, given the ends of these will be in the mooring lighters. In addition to the ti-incur wire ropes, the bight of an S-inch wire rope has been dropped before the mainmast into the gangway ports, and the ends poised aft under each quarter have been centred or feilddlod under the stern, and will be taken in by the Pearl. In addition to her ajach hawsers, the Rinaldo will have the two fore soda of the inch hawser. The Wave and Swan are ready for their work. These two ships will take in as many of the toggle pendants as the ships will ride ever. and all the ships will previously have been sunk three or four feet by allowing that amount of water in them, which will be discharged by powerful steam pumps so soon as the ships have been hove down to the wrack. The Popoff air bag ham been placed on the weather side in the gangway and successfully inflated, and the divers have carefully inspected all the toggles and hawsers now they are in position, and report them to be fixed satisfactorily. On Saturday a beautiful inkstand belonging to Captain Hare was recovered by one of the divers, and also a signal log, two white ensigns, and an Italian ensign, all four being unserviceable. On Saturday evening the' whole of the divers, riggers and camber men were brought in from the wreck, having succeeded in completing the necessary preliminary arrangements. On Saturday next 400 hands will be taken out to the wreck for the of tightening up the gear and fixing the par. chases, and on Monday and Tuesday next,' when the tides will have increased upwards of two feet in rise, the first lift will be made. Should the operators succeed in getting the ship out of the hole in which she lies embedded, the lifting vessels, which will be in the first instance placed across the wreck and immersed some two feet, so as to secure an additional rise as the water is pumped out, will then be fastened alongside, and the pewter repeated until the ports of the Eurydice have been brought above the water level.

THE RAISING OF THE EURYDICE.

Attempts to raise her Majesty's ship Eurydice, lying in the English Channel, off the southern extremity of the Isle of Wight, have at length eventuated in a successful scheme. She was lying in 60ft. of water, and embedded in 111 ft of mud, in which oho was gradually settling down. The alterations on the last plan have been few and simple. Wire hawsers were substituted for two chant so that the arrangements were in the following manor : The sterns of the Wave and the Swan, sad two smaller vessels, which ley &CMS the Eurydice beamwise, pointed towards Culver Oliff somewhat, while the larger vessels, the Pearl and Rinaldo. stood alongside them on the outside, pointing in the opposite direction. The two smaller vowels were each attached to the wreck by means of two toggles, the Rinaldo by two toggles and two j, wel moss, and the Pearl by four jewel roper, sit crossed in such '. manner ac to give the utmost resisting power. The wire hawsers used upon the Weaseled the Swan were both of 7in. diameter, while on the Rinaldo and tie Pearl, there ware two of 7in. and two of Sul. The work carried oat during the last fortnight had been of a very somplicatsd and troublesome character, from the fast that the rope and hawsers on board the four needs feria a very soaping series of interstices ; and whoa *gropes had to be let go a fortnight sins be mesa of the failure of the szpartheats, one mass enmeshment ensued.

When the tide was about flood the whole of the ninth were pumped into until they were sank to the depth required ; 924 tons of water were pumped into the Pearl until, with a depth in her held of ten feet, she was sunk Ave fast six inches.

When the wrack was lathe taut with these boats, and the water was pumped in thew, the amount they had been sank, added to the amount of the rise of ticie, gave a greater lift than the depth of the bole.

The only fear now was as to whether such a strain would or would not pull the lituydiees to pieces, but as the buoyany, in consequence of the' pumps pumping out the boats, and the tide increased, the wreck came up gradually. It was intended to have employed the turret - ship Thunderer as a tug as soon as the Eurydice was suspended in the water so as to have towed her with the gunboats attached to shallow r water.

THE EURYDICE.

There is to be a final effort made to-day to raise the Eurydice, and if that fails we should fancy ! the best thing would be to let her stop where she is, a huge coffin for the hundreds of brave fellows I who still remain in her. So long a time has elapsed, so fearfully decomposed must be the bodies, that one cannot help asking what j the raising of the vessel would do now, and if we | consulted our own private inclination we would I far rather that the ill-fated vessel remained at the | bottom of the sea. What would they do with the ship if they recovered her ? She could never be sent to sea again. Who would care to stop in such a charnel house. We, of course, are not superstitious, but if ever a vessel had dismal asso- ciations connected with her, it is the unfortunate Eurydice. Who could stay in a vessel which had j been the coffin of 300 or 400 men ? On sanitary | grounds, too, it would be bad. She must be by this time sodden with water and the decompooing ! particles of the unfortunate crew. The _i«»ht I that will greet the eyes of those who raise her j would be horrible, aud although we svmpathiso ; with the desire of those who wish to give their ! relatives decent Christian burial, it should be re- membered that it will be impossible to recognise the bodies, except by the marks on their clothing. We do not, however, believe it is possible to raise the ship if it were we do not see what good would be done, and we think the best thing now is not to waste any more money in the farce of trying to raise her. Already more money lias \ been spent than the value of the ship, and to fritter away any more in the fruitless attempts is useless. We notice that the member for t tic- Island, Mr. UaILLIE COCHRANE, entertained the j same view, and advocates fixing a l>u >y over the wreck "as a memorial of the gallant men who "lost their lives in their country's service." A - other member advocates asking for tenders from QuUide pcrnooa willing to undertake the raising

THE EURYDICE.

The salvage operations at the wreck have made considerable progress, favoured by a continumoe of fine weather. During the week the divers have been engaged in cutting away such running gear an would be likely to drag on the ground when the ship is raised. The Eurydice has been swept with four eight-inch steel hawsers, and heavy toggles, with double wire strops, have been introduced into the ports. To these strops 1 ] inch chain pendants have i been shackled on, and when the lift is given the ends j of these will be in the mooring lighters. In addition I to the eight-iucb wire ropes, the bight of an eight- inch wire rope has been dropped before the main- j mast into the gangway ports, and the ends passed aft under each quarter have been centred or feid.iled under the stern, and will be taken in by tho Pearl In addition to her eight-inch hawsers, the Rinuldo will have the two fore ends of the eight-inch hawser. The Wave and Swan are ready for their work, and these two ships will take in as many of the toggle- pendants as the ships will ride over, and all the ships will previously have been sunk three or four f^et by allowing that amount of water in them, which will be discharged by powerful steam pumps so soon as the ships have been hove down to the wreck. The Popoff air bag has been placed on the wea:her side in the gangway and successfully inflated, and the divers have carefully inspected all the toggles and hawsers now they are iv position, and report th»*n_ to be fixed satisfactorily. On Saturday a beautiful ! inkstand belonging to Captain Hare was recovered by one of the divers, and also a signal log, two white ! ensigns, and an Italian ensign, all four being unser- viceable. On Saturday evening the whole of the divers, riggers, and camber men were brought iv from the wreck, having succeeded in completing the necessary preliminary arrangements. To-day (Satur- day) 400 hands will be taken out to the wreck for tho purpose of tightening up the gear aud fixing the purchases, and on Monday or Tuesday next, when the tides will have increased upwards of two feet in rise, the first lift will be made. Sluuld the operators succeed in getting the ship out of the hele in which she lies embedded, the lifting vessels, which will be in the first instance placed across the wreck and immersed some two feet, so as to secure an ad- ditional rise as the water is pumped out, will then be fastened alongside, and the process repeated until the ports of the Eurydice have been brought above the water level. On Saturday the County Coroner held an inquest at Haslar Naval Hospital on the bodies of Charle-i Newbury, gunnery instructor, and Joseph Curtis'., corporal of Marines, both of Gosport. Mr. E. J. Harvey, Admiralty Law Agent at Portsmouth, watched the proceedings on behalf of the Admiralty. The bodies were in a terribly advanced state of de- ?? Coroner explained that he had decided not to re-open the matter, but the Registrar had refused a certificate, and the bodies could not be interred without this or a warrant from himself, and he could not give one without holding an inquisition. Consequently an inquiry was necessary to allow Christian burial to be accorded to the deceased He pointed out that a clergyman could bury without a certificate or a warrant, provided it whs not a sus- i picious death, and was reported within seven days jto the Registrar.— Mr. Harvey said that he had no j doubt instructions to that effect would be given to the Hospital Chaplain.— Two witnesses were then examined, George Carter, labourer, proving the ar- rival of the bodies at Haslar, and giving a descrip- | tion of the clothes they had on, and Benjamin Cud- diford, able-bodied seaman, one of the survivors, identifying the deceased. — The jury returned a ver- dict to the effect that the deceased were dr iwned by the capdzing of H.M.S. Eurydice, and the interment took place in the afternoon. — We understand that as more bodies are recovered from the wreck, they will be identified after being brought ashore, under the direction of an officer appoiutel by the Admi- ralty, and will be buried without any further inves- tigation. In the House of Commons, ou Monday, Mr. Baillie Cochrane asked the First Lord of the Admiralty whether, as it seemed impossible to raise the Eurydice, it would not be better to place a buoy over the place where she lies, with some memorial of the gallant men who perished there— Mr. W.ll. Smith : It is not considered to be impossible to raise the ship, and further attempts will be made to do so next spring tides, if the weather permits. To place a buoy over the wreck permanently would be a seri- ous obstruction to navigation (hear, hear). — Captain Pirn asked the First Lord of the Admiralty whether, as it appears that the Eurydice cannot be raised by the means at the disposal of the Admiralty, he would invite tenders from parties willing to contract with the Admiralty to raise and deliver the Eurydice afloat in Portsmouth harb-ur —Mr. W. H. Smith thought it undesirable to answer the questiou con- tingently. He might say he had no present inten- tion of inviting tenders— Mr. I). J. Jenkins asked the First Lord of the Admiralty when it was in- tended to hold a naval inquiry into the loss of Her Majesty's ship Eurydice; how it proposed that the Court should be constituted ; whether he had con- sidered if it would be advantageous to the public service that one or two experts, other than officers in Her Majesty's Navy, should form part of tha*, Court; and whethor he could inform the House what weight of ballast was put on board when that ship was last commissioned, and of what it consisted ; whether the water in tanks or any portion of the stores was r-iied upon to iisure her stability ; and, if so, what was the naturo and weight of such stores. —Mr. W. H. Smith : A court-martial in accordance with the Naval Discipline Act has been ordered to assembh to inquire iuto the loss of the Eurydice, and the meeting of the Court is ouly deferred in ex- pectation of obtaining some valuable evidence of the condition of the ship before she sank. The law d ie» not admit of experts being placed on the Court but the Court has power to call before it any porsu-i whom in their judgment they think it desirable to give evidence. The weight of ballast was 30 tons of iron pig ballast, the same as she carried on all former commissions The : last part of the second questiou will be a subject of inquiry by the Cou't.

THE EURYDICK FAILURE TO LIFT THE SHIP. In accordance wilt the programme settled by Admiral Superintendent the lion. F. A. C. Foley, in connection with the attempt to raise the Eurydice, which it was hoped might be made on Ho=morning. The riggers and divers to the wreck as early as three o'clock on liaturday morning, sad the Pearl corvette, and the gunboats Swan and Wave, liming been towed out to join the Rinaldo, every advantage wee taken of the lull to place the lifting vela% into position and attach them by the purchases across the wreck. The Pearl was placed at the stern to receive the ends of the jewel hawsers, the gunboat toggled on either elle of the mainmast, the Rinaldo being reserved for the tow jewels to be made fast to. The corvette and small craft were suocesfully lashed down, but on Sunday morning the wind shifted to the south-west, and the heavy lop, which sprang up, caused the Pearl to pitch to such an extent as to tames her ninednelt hawser to part, and she hod Genteelly to be eased to prevent her getting wholly loose, nothwithetanding that the violent thunderstorm which ensued had the effect of materially beating down the swell. The gunboats were allowed to remain in position in spite of the long roll which continued during the afternoon, though from the manner in which they struck against the it might be considered necessary to ease them off. At noon on Sunday the wind, which had been singularly variable, veered round to the north-west, and should it have the effect of moderating the MIL it was the intention of Captain Most to plaoe the Rinaldo in petition forward and secure her to the purchases. At three o'clock in the afternoon 90 men from the Asia, under the command of Staff-Commander Parker, sad other contingents from the ships in the harbour assembled in the dockyard, where tugs were ready to take them to the wreck for the purpose of heaving round the capstans by which the lifting shipe were to be pinned down at awl) , sleek on Tueeday morning ; but on Rear-Admiral Foley, who had been out personally superintending the operations, coming on there, the orders were countermanded and they were dismissed. The result was the loss of another day, the first actual lift which was appointed to be made on Monday morning at ten, being postponed until the some time on Tuesday. There was a slight breeze blowing from the south-east en Monday, but it was not powerful enough to have any effect on the sea, and the glees was ruing. The four lifting made were moored exactly in the p•etitions where they were wanted to receive the purchase., and Mr. W. B. Robinson (Chief-Constructor), and a *tall of officer, were at the wreck superintending the imniersiens of the ships by letting In the water. During M.w.day afternoon the toggle pendsots were successfully attached to the gunboats Swan and Wave, and the bow end of the steel hawser made fast to the Rinaldo ready to hove down. The Lord Warden which was to take up the the towing ropes at high water oss Tuesday arrived under sail from Portland, and was anchored in Sundown Bay, and there Were besides no fewer than six steam tugs to render whateverassistance may be required. Rear-Admiral Foley was present at the operation, the whole day. and remained out all night having about Pei employed under him in the final pinning down of the lifting vcorl..

ATTEMPT TO RAISE THE EURYDICE.

It was hoped that, with fine weather, the pro- : gramme arranged by Admiral Superintendent the j Hon. A. Foley, assi.-ted by Captains Polkinghorne, j Batt, and Dalham, would be attend-- d with success, ' and that the ill-fated Eurydice would be recovered, i It had been arranged that the sup-erne effort should | be made on Monday morning, but the unfavourable ! weather experienced on Sunday necessitated a day's delay. Monday was occupied in performing pre- : liminary work which had been postponed from the j previous day, and up to Monday night everything ! went on smoothly. Rear-Admiral Foley was pre- | sent at the operations the whole day, and remained , out all night, having about 400 men employed under him in the final pinning down of the lifting ve-sels. j They commenced work at 3 o'clock on Tuesday | morning, and completed the work of pinning down I the Wave and Swan gunboats and the Pearl and Rinaldo corvettes by 6 o'clock, water ballast having been let into each of the ships so as to submerge them three feet. The lowest tide was at a quarter to 6. and the steel wire hawsers and chain cables were hove taut by 6. Half an hour later the work of pumping out the four craft was commenced by lout tugs, with the addition of two of Merrywea- ther's cteam fire engines on the Pearl and Rinaldo. At this time the wind was blowing moderately from the north east, a- d the sea was comparatively calm. The pump ng occupied two hours, but while it was proceeding the wind shifted to east-north-east and a heavy swell set iv. Shortly after 8 o'clock the force of the wind had so much increased as to inter- fere considerably with the operations, and at the I time the after-chain of the Swan, attached to the i boggle, snapped, and it was necessary to slip the ! other chain in order to save the gunboat. While this was being done, the sea became so choppy that at twenty niinut s to 9 it "was found requisite to ease the hawsers. Shortly afterwards, the swell continuing to increase, orders were given for all the hawsers and toggles to be slipped, and Admiral I Fol*-y direct- d the return of the era it into harbour. During the proceedings the Swan got her quarter much damaged by collision with one ol the tugs, and a workman sustained some injuries. On Tues- day moming the Commander-in-Chief, Admiral E. G.'Fanshawe, C 8., with Flag Capt. the Hon. W. C. Carpenter, arrived at the wreck in the Fire Queen. 'Ihe Medina, gunboat, also brought out a party, including Lord Elphinstone, representing the Admiralty, and the Duke of Athole. In conse- quence of the unfortunate change iv the weather, another attempt cannot be made for a fortnight, and it is doubttul whether the interval would suffice to make the requisite preparations. It is thought extremely probable that the attempt to raise the vessel will be abmdoned. Another body was picked up at tbe wreck on Tuesday morning. The Lord Warden left the scene of the wreck on Tuesday afternoon, for Portland, and nothing has been done ! since worth recording.

THE EURYDICE. THE VESSEL SUCCESSFULLY LIFTED.

Admiral Superintendent the Hon. F. A C. Foley ras engaged at the wreck on Monday, and under is directions the Rinaldo, Pearl, Wave and Sw in, .•hich are to take part iv the lifting of the submerged tall, were placed in position without- any misadven- ure. Tin pinning down of the vessels was contin- icd during the night, and at G o'clock next morn- ng-, when low water, th=j operation of lifting was ommenced by the pumping of the water ballast out >f the lifting craft. The Thunderer, turret ship, Uaptaiu J. C. Wilson, arrived off Dunnose, from ?ortlaud, to tow the wreck into shallow water. Early on Tues lay morning the locale of the sunken vreck pre-cnted a scene of considerable animation. Hie weather was as tine as could have been wished lor, and a stranger could hardly have supposed ;hat a spot where perfect calm prevailed, the sea jeing quite smooth, had been the scene of a catastro- ohe of such an appalliug character. Admiral Foley End been hard at work during the priveous day, md remained at the wreck during the night, having willing and able coadjutors in Captains Polking- t.orne, Dathan, Batt, and Moss, Mr. W. B. Robinson, __iief constructor at Portsmouth, aud Mr. J. Purkis, dockyard foreman. The alterations of the last plan were few and simple. Wire hawsers had been sub- stituted for chains wherever chains had been pre- viously tried. The steras of Wave and Swan, two smaller vessels lay across the Euryd.ce beam wise, pointed towards Culver Cliff somewhat ; while the larger vess-ds, Pearl and Rinaldo, stood alongside of them on the out side, pointing in the opposite direction. The two smaller vessels were each attached to the wreck by means of two toggle », Rinaldo by two toggles and two jewel ropes, and Pearl by four jewel ropes, all crossed in such a manner as to give the utmost resisting power. The wire hawsers used upon Wave and Swan were both of seven-inch diameter, while on Rinaldo and Pearl were two of seven-inch and two of eight-inch. The lifting vessels, Pearl, Rinaldo, Wave, and Swan, with the Popoff air-bag, which is calculated to have a raising power of about 50 tons, were got into position near the wreck on Monday, and at 1 o'clock on Tue>day morning operations were resumed. Previous inves- tigations by the divers had shown that the hull of the Eurydice was imbedded to the exteut of about I lift., and when the work was vesumed on Tuesday morniuir, with every prospect of a continuance of favourable weather, the chief officials were sanguine that, barring unforseen accidents, the wreck would be removed from its cradle. At L o'clock, the tide '-eing about flood, the work of letting water ballast into the craft, which had beeu pinned down in order to submerge them the registered depth, was com- menced : 924 tons of water were pumped into PearJ, until, with a depth in her hold of 10ft. she was sunk oft. 6in. Rmaldo was made to hold 600 tons, with an internal depth of Oft. and external oft. ; while Wave and Swan were immersed 3ft. 6in. by means of 190 tons of water in each. By the time this wa. finished there was rather less than an hour to spare before it was dead low water, an ' in this interval every thing being made indubitably secure, by half-past o every body was waiting for an indication of the turn of the tide. When it had fairly turned the steam fire engines on board Pearl and Rinaldo were set vigorously to work, and wi h the aid of the double hose were pumping the water very fairly, when the experiment proved so success- ful that a steam tug- was sent alongside of each of these two vessels each with double hose to assist. This had been going on for about half an hour, when a tug was sent in between Wave and Swan in order to pump them. The wreck lay in 60f c. of water, and having by this time accumulated so much dead weight, to lift her at once to the surface would have been simply impracticable. The nature of the scheme of rescue, therefore, was. to raise her 10ft. by means of a loft, tide, plus whatever could be gained by the creation of buoyancy and brino-in^ to bear of additional lifting power. Therefore, supposing her to be lifted 1 0ft by the tide and oi u by the buoyancy created by pumping the water ut of the vessels, and so lifting her with th\.i>* f v.° would be a lift of loft., oniy 34ft. mo*- nT* fi™ depth of the hole in which she~w&, ' £ J?,? "J? was accordingly agreed th^ ?? "*D<xt__ea. | t method would be by a serie*^ * ™ l J practicable of every tide poss^W w3 ' ?? fc f in^vantage ment which VWV^ZI: re P e * tm s the e T x Pen- thus hopeA &\in „. f f ?? . on Tuesday. It was brought inta * eighfc or nme da ? s she would be ?? hAvh«.nV Wdter sufficiently shadow to permit Before & ?? into Portsmouth Harbour, the d ; lifting operations fairly commenced oh' ~ f IV *J S another inspection with the special o eject ot ascertaining whether the Popoff air bag was lw * ts place and secure. Having reported favour- ably, the pumping operations were watched with great interest, more especially as the wreck s mast came up at first, simultaneously with the lighters, and ultimately began to gain ot. them considerably. -By 8 o'clock the green seaweed on the wreck's ma*t had gradually become more conspicuous, and showed evident signs of her increasing buoyancy, > and by half-.past 9 the water had been pumped from all the lighters, and Eurydice shook her m*st occasionally, it was then determined to let well alone for the time, and wait for an improvement iv the tide, seeing that the rising water was liftiag the sunken craft so steadily and well. Thunderer was at hand waiting for her opportunity. Unfor- tunately she swept across the tide, and lost her cables and gear. This necessitated some delay, inasmuch as it took up valuable time in creeping for the hawsers. One was speedily recovej«d, but it required the work of a diver to find the- other. The second, however, was to have been dispensed with, and a rope hawser substituted; but as. Thunderer was about steaming towards the scene o£ operations her capstan fell overboard, carrying the Kne. Meauwhile experiments have been going on to test the buoyancy of the wreck. The hawsers facing Culver Cliff were drawii up taut, aacl those at the stern were slackened. This operation was continued for some time, under difficulties, ia being alrao-t im- possible to haul in the bow ropes, in consequence of what appeared to be the immovability of tue wreck. But sud lenly tbe cap.tana on adi the vesst ls worked easily, the wreck was seeifl to move, and the tars cheered lustily. The Thunderer having now be- come useless for all practical purposes for the day, the experiment with the hawsers was continued un- til it was deemed, advisable to send down divers to report the state *>i affairs. They reappeared with the r port that the Eurydice had been shifted out of the hole aud moved from 150 to 180 feet, and that she now rested on a solid foundation. The weather continued fine on Wednesday, aud the officials worked with a will. The programme, already described, was gone through again, b ing. commenced at 3 a.m., and everythiug went on satis- factorily. By means of water ballast, the 3<.arl and Rinaldo were each submerged 4ft. Gin., aud the Swan and Wave 4ft. The lifting commenced at 6 o clock, aud at 9 the wreck began to move towards the shore, and it was thought great progress would be made. In consequence of the mishap to the Ihunderer's capstan on Tuesday, the turret ship was not brought mto requisition, but tugs were employed to a sist in towing the moving hull in shore. Alter satisfactory progress had been made a steel wire jewel used in founer experiments, but which had oe n superceded, fouled an anchor, preventing fur- , ther progress for the day, and the wreck was grounded on a bank m 10 fathoms at low water, bein<»- 400 yards nearer land than before. The practical operations commenced on Thursday j at 8 o clock, and the lifting and forward movement I went on most successfully up to 2 o'clock. The ; actual results accomplished are as follows- The j luirydice has been moved forward in un easterly ; direction one mile and four-tenths of a mile She lies with a ,» list " between the Swan and the Wave, with the Rinaldo and the Pearl outside, all closely lashed together by strong hawsers. Her maintop ate out of water, and show unmistakeablc signs of h9r long detention in the " vasty deep," from which m c trust she has now finally parted company. The expectancies as regards further progress are that the next forward movement by to-day's (Friday) tide will be made broadside on to the tide. If to-day* work is as successfully favoured as Thursday's they expect to beach her, and the hope is that, no unto- ward accident occurring, she will be pumped out b\ Sunday, and ready to start for her original destiua . tion— Portsmouth -on Monday next. j Tho present position of the wreck is in a direct hue from the Culvers, leaning slightly in shoreward, about oue mile and a quarter from the Culvers, so | that she must have been moved from the original j scene of the disaster at least a mile and a half. ° The New Family Match Safe for Bryant and May's j Patent Safety Matches, supplies a want that has long | leeni.lt, and will be adopted afonee by all can ful hou.e^ • keepers.

THE EURYDICE.

The lifting operations were suspended on Friday for the re-arrangement of the plan hitherto adopted. Iron plates have been manufactured for taking off the rubbing effects on the sides of the sides of the Eurydice, and were taken out of harbour in the afternoon to be fixed in position. On Friday morning at low tides the quarter-davits of the sunken vessel were visible and it was officially ascertained that she was within a mile of the Culver Cliff, entirely out of the tide way, so that she will not be in danger even should the weather take an unfavourable turn It was not expected that the actual lifting of the wreck can be proceeded with before this day, but of every moment was utilised by divers to clear the decks as far as practicable, and they have been busily engaged in preparing to cut away the mainmast. Orders have been issued regulating the steps to be taken for the recovery of valueable property so soon as the ship shall be pumped dry. A lieutenant, two warrant officers, a dockyard detective and a ship's steward have been appointed for this purpose, except for special moans, no persons will be permitted to enter the cabins until search has been made. Particubx attention is to be paid to the recovery of the public chest and of large onus of money believed to be in possession of the ship's corporal and a lieutenant in the itoyal Engineers, who were on board. The Dockyard officials are preparing comparative list of weights carried by the Lurydic . e in her commissions of 1846, 1846 and 1877, and oho descriptive drawings of her angle stability, for the purpose of the tourt-martial. We had hoped to have been able to record the fact that the Eurydice was safe in Portsmouth Harbour at the time of going to press with our present issue, but it seems that a little more delay is necessary. On Monday evening the ehipwirght department of Portsmouth Dockyard finished their part of the work of adapting the Peed, Rinaldo, Wave, and Swan to the new place of lifting the wreck from the sides, 100 men having been engaged upon these vessels throughout Sunday. Much, however, remains to be done in the way of strengthening the sides of the craft with wooden balks, and it is not expected that the necessary preliminaries can be completed before Friday or miturday. The Peral will be located on the port side of the Eurydice, and alongside her, for the purpose of increasing her stability, will be the Swan ; whilst the Rinaldo and the Wave will be similarly platted on the starboard side. The wreck will not, as heretofore, be swept with hawsers, the lift having to be effected entirely by means of 16 toggles, eight being fixed in position on each side, secured by Tin. wire hawsers, each capable of standing a strain equivalent to a hundred tons. Though not altogether out of the tide, the Eurydice is in water that is less in the run of the tide, and this will be highly advantageous in rendering the lifting vessels more manageable than has hitherto been the came. It is intended to lift the Eurydice with successive tides as high tie may be found practicable, then to cloge up her ports and hatchways, and afterwards to pump her dry, when she will flo.tt to W the surface b lt y virtue of her own bouyancy. ith this resu attained the salvage operations will be completed and the wreck will undergo a thorough fumigation before being brought into harbour. On Monday the Manly tug brought a body into harbour, and a chest of drawers and a cashbox were also recovered from the unfortunate frigate. THE MAINLAND. BY WATCHMAN. Messrs. Hunt and Hance, the well-known auctioneer . 1 Lind have made a hit in reviving the stock fairs in the district of Beaulieu. The sales will bo chiefly for lambs and wool, and will be held four times a year. Thu first, held on Monday, was a s ignal IMOCW, the following stock being entered for vale in the cattle yards said meadow adjoining the Montague draw :—Sheep, 377 ; lambs, 217 ; horned cattle. 41 ; ram lambs, 50 ; pedigree stock o f Devon beasts, bred by Mr. Biel. 15; pigs, 32 ; boreal, 13; and fleeces of wool, 1,300. Of course a lu nch eon was a sow own in the pragramme of inch a gathering, and I am not guilty of over gallantry in Baying that Miss Lane, the landlady gained the complete approbation of the numerous e . n u a:rj e - rs - all Judges of cuisine. The supplemented the repast with a good supply of wise. Mr. Cabin, steward to Lord Henry Scott, ably presided, and the toast list was disposed of with despatch on account of the business to follow. The toast of the Auctioneers was war received in a manner which mast have been very gratifying to the firm. I should Mos to reproduce the good things that were said, but I am reminded that there are limits to even newspaper columns, and I must content myself with giving the following manila of the rale :—Fat withers, 628. to 675. ; fat ewes, 50a. to Me. ; store togs, 50s. ; fat lambs, 355. to 50s. ; store lambs, Me. to 35e, Mr. J. W. Biers Fortedows ram lambs and Mr. W. Biers improved Hampshire Down lambs sold readily at at 3to 4 gains's,. They were beautiful lambs. The superior Down p edigree calves, also bred by Mr. J. W. Biel, were - in demand for 5 to 7 guineas each —and yearlings 12 to 14 guineas. Fat beasts, £l7 to 11 , 31 ; heifers in calf 1:11 to £l6 ; cows and calves, V 5 ; store stoers, £1 . 2 to £lslos ; store pigs, 13s. to 19s. 6d. The wool, which war a new feature in this aale, and was of very es cellent quality, commanding 15 for togs and 15i for Down ewes. Beer drinkers will be pleased to learn that th Lop gardens In Hants ancl Surrey are looking well s 14dthis must be set the tact that in Sumer and u tent matters are not quite so promising, blight being apprehended. On Monday • terrific dorm of wind, thunder and lightning broke over South a mpton. Many bonsai were flooded and the Wesleyan Church was much damaged. Among other naval items I learn that the Euphrates, Indian troopship, is ordered to proceed on a fortnight's coestvrisc service this week. The Sultan, late flagship of the Duke of Edinburgh, is to be supplied with torpedo gear, and the requisite mcliminary arrangements are in progress. On Friday en Admiralty order was received at Portsmouth Dockyard for all the hired men, in addition to those voted In the estimates for the years, to be discharged at the expiration of a month, and for all overtime in the yard to be discontinued after Saturday. The Dreadnought turret-ship is being kept under steam for a week, for the purpose of testing her ventilating fans, boat winches, turret engines and hydraulic pumps. lu the military world the Duke of Cambridge reviewed the whole of the troops in Portsmouth Garrison, preliminary to the disbanding of the Army Reserves. After the inspection, the divisor marched past In double column of companies, in mars, and in line of quarter brigade. They then re-formed on the original alignment, advanced in line, and presented arms, after which the combined bands played the National Anthem. His Royal H:glinesa at tbg close of the review, called the commanding officers to the front, and expressed unqualified satisfaction in the physique and drill of the men. The Duke of Cambridge afterwards proceeded to Winchester. • Iron Duke is, by an Admiralty order received at Portsmouth, ordered to call at the port on Monday next far her atom pinnace and Mitebad Wanda&

This done, the divers were set to work to e"scor the ports on the lee side, which are about t.oree feet below water at low title, a party of .:iirwrighte were sent to cover the ports on the last side, which are now out of water. In the mare of Monday eleven more bodies were discovered. They were found on the main deck, in, .of couree. the most shocking condition.

A whyard launch simultaneously brought a cargo of euthua from h Pearl, and, with *covered barge ititendeti for the reception of the coffins, took up - a peition under the fore part on the Aerated side. lie shells were passel into the deck, and eleven Waive, which were 'looting. were quickly recovered, totaued separately, and then towed away in the barge. it °detente being freely used.

At low water the upper put of the poet bilge was out of water, and a party of ninety sea no. began to clear the upper deck and to float the ..otter and the crew's boat, whilst the Adniiral- Superintendent and luspottor.Getieral Danville managed to penetrate into the captain'a cabin and also the weather chins, but found no bodies in dam. They were unable to pass into the starboard cabins, the water remaining as high as the centre tt the combing of the main hatchway . S. On the pet aide the guns remained in position in the mid. ,hip, port forward, and the port under the main chains, and those the starboard side in the putt before the gangway and tltat abaft the gangway were also visible.

The apertures on the weather shit are to be closed and caulked by the dockyard shipwrights. The closing of the wreck is expected to be completed by to-day, after which she will be pumped out, cleaned, and disinfve ed., and then towed into the harbour and moons' in some remote creel.

TWO BODIES FOUND.

-0n Saturday morn ing, between 6 and 6 o'clock, two bodies were washed ashore near to Sir William Ilutt'a pier at Apley ; one of the bodies was headless, but a human head was found floating near the spot. The bodies were in a very advanced state of decomposition, and almost nude, so that there were no means of identification ; but there is little doubt that they were from the ill-fated Eurydice. Coffins were procured, and the bodies conveyed by the Coastguard to the mortuary at the Cemetery. At half-past sin the afternoon the funeral took place at the north side of the Cemetery. Palls were thrown over the cuffing, which were carried, shoulder high, by eight Coastguerdsmen, under the superin, tendence of Mr. Jeffery', the chief of fi cer. They were met at the grave (both being interred in one) by Mr. WeethaU, a gentleman residing in Hyde, who read portions of Scripture. and afterwards addressed the large eon. course of people, remarking that it waira very I solemn ocauocas, and took their thoughts back Ito the 24th March, when about 300 poor men and boys were drowned by the capsizing of the Eurydice; the bodies of two of them were in the coffins before them ; there were no names on the coffins, but the men were known to tuod- Be nothing of their history, and he did not know whether they were Christians, and he had nothing to do with that. They were surrounded by mysteries ; oven their own exist. enco was a mystery, and it was a most mysterious thing that the poor creatures who were drowned would have been on land in about an hour, and would have boon welcomed by loving friends; but it was not to be. They could not understand it, but the light of eternity would interpret all mysteries, and all they bad to do was to bow to the will of God, fur would not the Judge of the whole earth do right? The lesson for all of them to learn was the uncertainty of human life. Those who were drowned were in good health and spirits a few minutes before, and then were called to their final account. There were these present who evidently bad sympathy for those who bad Leon thus taken suddenly away. Although they were taken thus suddenly, it was possible they might have been able to give one look to the Saviour, and there was life in a look. It did not take long to aive the thief on the crosa,and they might hope that many in the Eurydice were saved, and he was glad to believe that many on board loved the Saviour. Mr. Wosthall concluded the simple, but very impressive, service by offering prayer and pronouncing the benediction. There was something exceedingly affecting in witnessing the two plain, nameless coffins placed in the grave, and no friends or relatives near to pay the last tribute of affection ; and also in the thought that until the morning of the resurn2t 'ion it must remain a profound seen ' as to was interred in ityde Cemetery on turday afternoon.

THE EURYDICE. Continuing oar narrative of the operations with the wreck of the Eurydice, we have to record a TIIREATENED BREAK VP. On Thursday evening a gale set in from the east and continued on k riday morning, leading too further suspension of the salvage operations The waves broke over the wreck. causing her to oscillate violently, and at daylight it appeared that the hull would be considerably ' swaged by the high wind and the rough sea. The flow of the water through the ports and down the hatchways quickly began to snap the planks of the upper deck, anda tremendous strain was thrown upon the hull generally, leading to the general apprehension that she would come to pieces. The Rinaldo and a lighter were sent into harbour, and in-tractions were given for the Pearl to follow, and all the steam tugs were ordered out with all practicable speed to render assistance in recovering bodies and wreckage. Four bodies were picked up from the main deck at low water under considerable difficulties, and two others were washed ashore at Shanklin, while -everal were reported as floating past Rembridge Point and down the Channel. The dockyard officials directing the °per.- tions did all they possibly could to lessen the extent of the damages to the wreck of the Eurydice, but on Thursday evening greater part of the upper deck had gone, and it g als had blown throughout the night the chanias, were that the hull would have gone to wreck the dangerous portion of the wreck is thoroughly recognised by the Admiral-Super- 

ioteadent, the Hon. F. A. C. Foley, and the scientific officials in charge of the operation, no moment has been lost in hermetically fastening up the hull, pumping her oat, and clearing her decks. As fright be expected thousands of Tisiten and residents in various parts of the Inland have visited Sandown in order to indulge in a sight of the ill-fated Eurydice, which has been beached shout a cable's length from the shore off Bedell& Bay which is contiguous to the Culver,. There was a rather rough sea running into the bay on Thursday, and on that day the body of a man was washed ashore nut far from the beached frigate. The body was in a better state of preservation than some picked up three months ago. The flesh on the hands could be seen, though nearly black, but that of the face had almost entirely disappeared. Under the collar of the poor fellow's serge was stamped "W. Blinker ;' which is supposed to be the name of the wearer. It was intended to inter the body near thole of his comrades lying in Sandown then:heard. There has b;en another body washed ashore sear Luccombe during the week, and is supposed to be that of an officer, but there is difficulty in indentillcation. Two more bodies were picked up near Apley on Saturday morning, and interred in Ryde Cemetery in the afternoon. Particulars of the ceremony will be found in oar local news. Another was also recovered on Sunday.

THE OPERATIONS AT THE EURYDICE.

After the departure of the Rinaldo on Friday afternoon, the wind increased in violence, aud it was found expedient to bring the Pearl and the tusrs into the harbour. With the exception of the Grinder, which had on board Lieut. Wonhain, whc was left in charge of the wreck, the Eurydice war who ly deserted. Happily the wind went round slightly to the north, or the wreck must have gone to pieces. Ou Sunday, though the wind continued to blow freshly from the southward— and thus tht least favourable for the resumption of operations— the Pearl was again taken out to Sandown Bay and the tugs were once more on the spot. Admiral Sir Houston Stewart, the Controller of the Navy, and Rear- Admiral Foley, the Superintendent of tin of the Dockyard, paid a visit to the scene of the wreck in the morning. Operations were continued on Monday. The six steel hawsers were passed across and under the ship's keel in readiness, divers haviug been down and inserted toggles in three of the starboard ports. The steel pendants attached were not only useful to a-sist in lifting the wreck, but were of service in righting the ship to some extent from tho angle at which site heeled over to starboard. On Monday evening the Royal yacht Osborne steamed into Sandown Bay and' brought up near the Eurydice. On board were the Prince and Fruifwa of Wales, Prince Albert Victor and Irmce George, in the uniforms of naval cadets, and the three little Princesses, with ladies ano gentlemen in attendance. One of the Osborne's boats was lowered, and the Prince of Wales in naval uniform, with the captain commanding the Osborne, and other officers and gentlemen, were rowed to the Eurydice. The officers who were in charge of her at the time were Staff- Captain Dathan, Staff-Captain Batt, Commander Moss, and Lieut Wohnam. His Royal Highness clambered up the side of the wreck, and remained some time in con- versation with these officers, taking much interest in their description of what had been accomplished and of their plan for future operations. The captain of H.M.S. Valorwg, which has been attending ou the other ships in Sandown Bay, was also on the wreck during the Prince's visit. The Osborne -teamed out of the bay about G o clock on her return to Osborne. On Wednesday, operations wee continued at tne wr.-ck of the Eurydice, and the resul's winch at- j tended than augurs well fur the ultimate success oi the endeavours to raise the vessel. The wind, which, . during the last few days, had persistently blown from a quarter which was lea^t desirable, tell oli considerably during Tuesday night, and on VV ednes- day morning the working party were enabled to proceed with the task which had recently been so frequently delayed by the boisterous weather. Ihe authorities, seeing the exposed position in which the Eurydice was placed in Sandown Bay, had wr some time contemplated removing the wreck round the ; corner of the Isle of Wight, as a temporary measure. | ! so as to be out of the way of the heavy sea which j Pets in at this point -whenever there- tsnrstitf breeze blowing, and accordingly on Wednesday operations j were resumed with this intent, lt was low water | about 11 in the morning, and the arrangements for ; slinging the vessel, th** insertion of toggles, and the , | passing round of hawsers having been accomplished ! ! by that time, the lift was commenced as arranged . I Previously the Pearl and Rinaldo was secured to tie ! Eurvdice on either side, and to counterbalance the | strain which would be brought to bear upon them when the lift was begun the gunboats Wave and Swan were lashed on the outside of the two ships, i As the tide rose the lift was satisfactorily effected, | and the two Government tugs Camel and Grinder, j which were in readiness, took the wreck and lifting craft in tow. The flotilla was slowly but satisfac- torily brought round the corner of the Isle of Wight, and during the afternoon the Eurydice was grounded in St. Helen's Roads, where it was thought ?? to leave her for the presunt. The vessel is now in j 24ft. of water, and when the tide is full low the I depth will be reduced about Bft. more. On Thurs- day efforts were made to get the wreck sweetened somewhat, as the putrefaction of the bodies on board wouid render it highly undesiroble for the ship to he brought into a place crowded with craft in her pre- sent unsanitary condition. After this has b-x-n done the wreck will be agaiu lifted nnd towed into Ports ! mouth Harbour, the idea of pumping li rout being i now abandoned, in consequence of the ship having been so knocked about during the recent gales.

INQUIRIRS IX PARLIAMENT.

In the House of Commons on Thursday evening Mr. Jenkins called attention to the keg of the Eurydice. His opinion was that when the ship left England she was neither properly ballasted nor provided with sufficient stability to enable her to encounter heavy weather with security. He was not prepared to say that on that account the ship was un. seaworthy ; but she was in such a condition as to require the utmost skill in handling her to avoid disaster. He was told on good authority that when the ship was beating out of Storno. way, before her last voyage, her performances under canvas led certain people to predict that, should she encounter any extraordinary weather the result would be disastrous. The ship depended largely for her stability upon the ballast afforded by her consumable dares, which was very unreliable. Her tanks could not have been full when she was lost. He was convinced that no officer of experience was on deck when she was struck by the squall, and if his memory served him rightly nearly all the ships lost to her Majesty's Navy for some years past were lost when they were in charge of junior officers. After a few words from Colonel Berodord and Mr. Muntz, Mr. A. Egerton said he thought this was hardly an opportune time foe raising the quedion, since in a few days a thorough inquiry would be opened. The ship was as carefully prepared for the service for which she was intended us any ship that ever left the dociyard. She was never regarded as unsafe. The weight of her tanks was 110 tons, and she I l carried tons of ballast as well. This was the weight she had always carried before. She was not overmasted. Her officers, from the captain downwards, were most carefully selected, arid were all men who had had considerable experience. As to the training of lieutenants, it was the custom to give them charge of gunboats and small draft boats before they were promoted to iron ships. It was hoped that in a very short time she would be in harbour, and then a thorough examination, which was no doubt rqy, would take place p e nding which he de criticism on the conduct of soy person on board flat ship.

THE EURYDICE.

Since our last issue the wreck of the Eurydice has been removed from the exposedposition in Sundown Bay to more sheltered quarters west of St. Helen's fort. As the tide rose the hull was lifted and taken in tow by the two Government tugs, Camel and Grinder, and the flotilla slowly moved round the corner of the Island, and on Wednesday afternoon the Eurydice was grounded in St. Helen's Roads the vessel was in 24 ft. of water, which was reduced about aft. at ebb tide. It was then thought desirable to disinfect the wreck, as the putrefaction of the bodies rendered it very undesirable to place the ship among other craft. The idea of pumping out was thought to be impracticable, on account of the injury done to the ship by the gales which had prevailed.

THE LOSS OF THE EURYDICE. COURT-MARTIAL AT PLYMOUTH.

On Tuesday an inanity into_ the of H.M.S. Eurydice was opened on b ond the Duke of Wellington flagship, Portsmouth. Admiral Famhawe, C. Commander-in-Chief, Portsmouth, wedded, and there was a full attendance of officers. The Eurydsoe, ailing frigate, was lost off Deane Point, Isle of dur:sg _ a sodden violent squall, on Sunday, the 24th March when on her homeward voyage from the West I The two survivors gave their evidence before the coroner at Ventnor. A court-martial was opened by the Admiralty, to be held on the survivor, Benjamin Cuddeford sad Sydney Fletcher, seamen, bat this is only formal, and a scientific inquiry will- follow as to the construction of the ship, and her condition at the time of her loss.l Depositions as to the loss of the ship were read.— Benjamin Cuddeford stated in evide nce that he had been at sea 21 rears, and he was on board the Eurydice about 14 Months. He had been an able seaman for 14 years. On board the Eurydice be was at first captain's isozwain, and at the time of the accident he was second captain of the quarter deck. It was his afternooevratch on the 24th of March, but, as wad customary in the Eurydice on a Sunday, the men on watch were allowed to ,remain below until wanted for duty. lie was on deck nearly the whole of the afternoon of the 24th of Mareh. He saw Captain Han on deck at 12.30,1 and at ten minutes past two. He saw him again on deck just after half-past three. At the latter time be was on the bridge. Boon after the watch to which witness belonged came on duty, an order was given to set starboard studding sails, and more sail was sumuently est. Just after half-past three tki wakt was called to shorten sail, and this was done. He could not now remember who was °Seer of the watch on this afternoon. It was to Mr Randolph, su b-lieutenant, that the captain give the ceders to take in upper sails and order the men down from aloft. The captain wee carrying on d ut y at the uarter-deck, and the officer of the watch on the forecastle,where be had been sent by the to assist in taking in the lower studding 12.30 a.m. to 2.10 POI., when the lower studding sail was set, a moderate breeze was blowing, and he noticed no difference until the squall came on. The ship was under all plain sail at 12 o'clock and at 12.30 topmast studding sails were set, and later enthelowerstuddingsaile. Whenthe log washove, just after thelowerstudding sail wasset,the shWwas going at eight and a half knots. The lower studding sail was taken in on account of the increasing wind, but when forward be did not notice that the foxtopmast studding sail boom M was "complaining." ad it been so be must Dave noticed it. The captain did not name the up sails which were to be taken in. He gave the order quickly " Watch, in upper sails. Some of the topgallantyard men went aloft, but he could not say how many. The captain immediately called them down again, and the ship was at once struck by the squall and heeled over. At that time the ship was going about 12 knots an hoer. The order to pat the helm up was given by the ca= and the Hon. Mr Giffard, a sob-lieutenant , aft to help to execute it, but he could not say if the helm was put up or down. He never notice d that the ship's head was altered at all. As seaman, he considered everything was done in • sea. menhir,' manner to prevent danger to the ship. Nothing was done which was likely to cause danger. There was a life-buoy on each side of the bridge, two in each boat, and life-belts in the cutter for her view. He could not say if the lower deck scuttles were out that afternoon or not. He knew of no order for the Eurydice to close the main deck ports in bad weather or at fixed times. All the deck poets were open except two on each side. On the afternoon of the catastrophe the sashes of the ports were not shipped. Thosewhich were not open had guns in them. The ship completed provision-taking at Bermuda, but he did not know how much she took in. The provisions and the water were taken in at the last moment. Stores were taken in for conveyance to ` England, amongst them being wire rigging. hen the tanks of the Eurydice were empty they were not filled with salt water. Restrictions were made on the issue of water for washing purposes, and thie made a great savinngg in water. OnWednes dayevidence was taken as tc atmospheric phenomena observed between three and four o clock on the afternoon of the 24th March. The evidence showed that two squalls, accompanied by snow, followed rapidly after each other, the effect of the first being to deceive experienced men as to the nature of the second , which struck the Eurydice and caused her to founder. Both squalls lasted =lb minutes, and the sun shone brightly ore and after the disaster. Dismantling operations showed that several sails were loosened before the ship foundered.

JUDGMENT OP TEE EURYDICE COURT MARTIAL

The Deputy Judge Advocate gave the following judgment at the opening of tho court on Monday morning. 1. —At a Court-Martial assembled on board of the Duke of Wellington flagship, iu Portsmouth Harbour, on Aug.:,, 1878, to inquire into the bus of her Majesty's ship Eurydice, pursuant to the !MA and 92nd section of the Naval Discipline Act, Del 6, do find that her hLajesty's 014. Eurydice foundered on the afternoon of March 21, 1874, by pressure of wind upon her sails during a sudden and exeeptiunally dense snowstorm which overtook her when its approach wee partially hidden by the proximity of the ship to high land. 2 8411110 of the upper half ports on them sin deck were open at the time, which materially couditood to the catastrophe• but the court consider that the upper half riorts having been open„ was justifiable and natal under the state of wind and weather up to the Limo of the occurrence of the storm. 3 Lille Court are of opinion that no blame is attributable to saps.... The ...weals wee fro quietly on the deck during the afte.noon, and personally carrying on the duty before and at th.. time the squall struck her. 4.—The Court are further of opinion, from do. mentary evidence that due consideration w.,- given to the stability of the Eurydice when the dodges for her coustruition were decided upon and carried out. ney are use convinced, by the official reports of ail the captains who commanded her SI% a 211-gun frigate, embracing a period of nearly ten year,' sea service, and by a special report from Almiral Sir William Parker. on the occasion of her being tested against other ships of various ricitcriptiona,thatthe Eurydice was a ship posoooing good qualities of stability up to the time that the was selected for adaptation as a training thip, nod that when the noceosary alterations were completed in May, 1877, she was in every respect an efficient shit., and the evidence shows that her stability was maintained. The Court do fully acquit tile survivors, Benjamin Cuddeford, able seaman, and Sydney Fletcher, ordinary seaman ; and the said Benjamin Cuildieford and Sydney Fletcher are hereby so folly acquitted accordingly.

THE ERUPLYDICE FLOATED AND TOWED INTO PORTSVUMUTH.

The Eurydice has at last been safely bronghitto the sur- face, the floating operations having been successfully accom- plished on Sun day, andthevessel was towed into Portasm.outh exactly tweuty-.three weeks after her homeward voyage was brought to so abrupt and sada termination. The beach was always well thronged with promenaders on Sunday, and the usual morning atte ndance had just been augmented by hundreds of persons coming from church. Consequently, the Beach and Piers were soon lined with spectators who evinced the utmost curiosity and interestin the proceedings. As the ships approached the harbour the "Pilot Jack" was run up at the Semaphore Tower in the dockyard. This flag is alwayE exhibited when a ship of the navy is either entering or leaving harbour, so that the Eurydice, notwith- standing her battered and dismantled condition, is still regarded as a ship in commission, although but two of her crew remain to be paid off. As the ships passed the various vessels in the harbour the decks were lined with officers and men, many of whom had lost both relatives and friends in the foundering of the ship which had now been recovered from the deep. Amongst the spectators on board the flagship, Duke of Wellington, were Cuddiford and Fletcher, the twosurvivors, who are waiting the result of the court-martial, the decision of which will be read to-morro s. The vessels continued to the extreme end of the harbour, beyond the north corner of the dockyard, and the Eurydice was then safely berthed alongside the Laurel hulk. The steam tugs then withdrew, a party being left on board to take charge, together with two of Merryweather's powerful steam engines. which were to he used in continuing the work of pumping. Only one, however, was needed to keep the water under, for it was found that the Eurydice only leaked to the extent of three inches in half an hour. The hull of the Eurydice presents a sadly different appearance from what she did on the day she fbundered. The smart white hull, chequered with the black ports, has all disappeared, and in their place is a hull denuded of nearly all its paint, scratched and splintered in al directions, whilst numerous planks nailed on to the sides for the purpose of repairing several of the leaks are not calculated to add to her smart- ness. One more body was discovered on the lower deck, making altogether 130 recovered from the wreck. The entire centre of the upper deck is washed away through the violence of the waves ?? the tinm the wreck lay in Sandown Bay. The planks placed crosswise form a means of communication from one part of the upper deck to the other. On going below a scene of chaotic confusion presented itself. Most of the gear has been removed from the main deck, and many of the cabins knocked away; but the deck is still littered with the broken spars and rigging. It is upon the lower deck that the scene is most chaotic; the deck is littered with debris fromn end t9 end, and the whole is covered with a murddy aline several inches deep. Officers' chests, men's clothes, bags, bee: bar- rela bird cages, pickle bottles, surgical casesand instruments lie upon the deck in a heterogeneous mass. Locomotion be- . tween decks, in consequence of the quantity of mud whicb has been washed in, was extremely difficult. On the lower deck is sttsuted the bread room, from which a most ia- tolerable stench nroceeded from the decomposed bread and other prolislots, notwithstaiiSinZ the fact tht the decks are continually washed with carbolic acid. The captain's cabin has teen entirely removed. On the lower deck are several cells, in one of which a prisoner was found minus his head. The poor fellow was not chained; bat another one on the lower deck was. The irons have been found near the mainmast, but no body. The holds it is at present impossible to get down into, owing to the fact teas all the moveable gear near the spot has rolled into them and choked them up. In making room for the suction pipes to go down the lumber into the hold the divers came across a body jammed in, and supposed to be that of the bread room boy. Several articles of uniform and clothing were scattered atout the lower deck, amongst which is a lieutenarit's undress uniform coat. The coart-mart fal assembled to inquire into the cause of the loss of the Eurydice delivered their finding on Monday. They were of opinion that the ship foundered in a sudden and exceptionally dense snowstorm on March 24, by pressure of wind on the sails, and that the upper half-ports being justifiably open, considering the state of the previous wind and weather, naturally conduced to the catastrophe. No one is to blame, the captain being frequently on. deck, and carrying on duty before and at the time the squall struck her. The court is further of- opinion that the stability of the ship was maintained after her adaptation as a training ship, and that after the alterations in May, 1877, she was in every respect an efficient ship. They fully acquit the two survivors, Cuddiford and fletcher. A report as to whether the Eurydice is to be repaired has not yet been presented, but there is very little doubt that the wreck, as soon as it has been cleared, will be taken into dock and broken up. The hull is in a most dilapidated condition, and altogether so strained that it would probably cost more money to place the Eurydice in sea-going trim than the ship would be actually worth. The opinion that she will be broken up is strengthened by the fact that many vessels in far better ,nr ition which have been broken up.
