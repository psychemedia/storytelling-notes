<h1>Macpherson’s Rant<a class="headerlink" href="#macpherson-s-rant" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h1>
<p><em>I first came across this story whilst searching for traditional gipsy fiddler stories. My telling is a combination of several historical accounts, which all seem to differ in various ways. I try to retain the essence of the story whilst tying up loose ends or rather clunky bits that appear in some accounts.</em></p>
<p>James, or Jamie, Macpherson was the bastard son of a laird, born to a gypsy mother but brought up in his father’s household. He was strong, a forceful character, and a gifted musician: many was the night when the young James Macpherson would dazzle the ceilidh with his violin playing.</p>
<p>All things must come to an end, however, and when he father died, the estate went the way of a more, shall we say, legitimate claim, and Jamie took to the hills, to the gypsy life that was in his blood.</p>
<p>These were hard times for gypsies, though, the Scottish travellers, the Scottish Romanies, the “Egyptians”: harried, untolerated, persecuted, even, much as they are to this day. They were also seen as lawbreakers, <em>sorners</em>, people who would camp without permission in empty farmers’ barns and outhouses that dotted the wild landscape. But Jamie’s band were honourable, or so it is said, and if you spent the evening with Jamie and his men, you could guarantee he’d keep everyone entertained with his fiddle playing.</p>
<p>It is said that there are tales of how Jamie and his band of followers were the Scottish equivalent of Robin Hood and his Merry Men, but I don’t know about that: you’d have to ask his clansmen. But it does seem as if he had good nature, and that it contributed to his downfall.</p>
<p>I’m not sure how he was arrested the first time….</p>
<p>Perhaps it was following the night when he stopped his men raiding a house — and they would only raid the houses and farms of wealthy men, sharing their spoils with the those in need of them — when the master of the house was burying his wife and child — it would be wrong to exploit such a time of grief; one of the gang took issue with giving up on such easy pickings and informed the local Sherriff as to Jamies’ whereabouts…</p>
<p>Or maybe it was the tale I heard tell that one night he heard a firghtened scream coming from the farmhouse near where he was camping for; that he and his men raced to the cottage, that they found Lord Braco there, molesting the daughter of the house: surely, he set about Braco, and sent him and his men on their way with their tails between their legs; some say that Jamie Macpherson then wooed and fell in love with that fair maiden, others that as a result of that night, Braco raised a warrant for Jamie’s arrest, for sorning, and for being an “Egyptian”, which is to say, a gypsy.</p>
<p>Whether Macpherson actually waylaid the messenger and stole the warrant, or whether the summons was delivered to the Sheriff, Jamie just seemed to grow and grow in confidence. At one point, he announced he would take a procession into Aberdeen, led by his piper ahead of him. This was no doubt a flagrant act of protest, of sticking two fingers up at the magisterial authorities; but it seems they authorities were better prepared than Jamie had expected, because he was captured, and imprisoned.</p>
<p>But his merry men — if you could ever imagine a band of huge, great, sword wielding, hairy Scottish gypsy warriors being described as “merry men” — came to his rescue: one retrieved his sword, another outwitted the jailer and freed Jamie Macpherson. In the course of the escape, a local butcher, who also topped up his wages by acting as the local hangman, tried to apprehend Jamie, leaping stunt man style from an upstairs window and landing on top of him. Seeing his trusty dog nearby, the butcher called to the dog — “get him, kill him” — but with lightning quick presence of mind, Jamie’s accomplice threw his plaid — you know, his tartan shawl — over the butcher, and so confused the dog that the dog then started mauling his covered master.</p>
<p>And so it was, Jamie returned to the hills, making occasional raids, staying, or sorning, wherever the road took him. Until he was captured again.</p>
<p>This time, there was to be no escape, even though you might argue that no escape was necessary. Because even though Braco, recalling his previous warrant for arrest, would have Jamie judged by the Laird of that place, a kinsman of Jamie, and sentenced to death by a loandowner’s right, others would argue that the jurisdiction lay elsewhere. Indeed, after lobbying by Jamie’s cousin — remember, Jamie was the son of a laird jhimself, even if an illegitimate one — a reprieve from that sentence was granted by the Sheriff… But…  somehow…  Braco managed to hear of it.</p>
<p>And even though the time for the execution had been set… well, Braco couldn’t risk it. The messenger with the reprieve would surely been on his way by now, he might arrive at any time…  and so, Braco had the hands of the clock of that place moved forwards, hastening the allotted time of execution.</p>
<p>Macpherson was led out to the gallows.</p>
<p>He asked for one last request — that he be allowed to play a tune on his trusty fiddle — and the wish was granted.</p>
<p>Taking his trusty fiddle in hand. he played a tune of his own composition, a tune known variously today as Macpherson’s Rant, or Macpherson’s Lament.</p>
<p>He looked around at the assembled audience, haunted looks as they realised this hero’s days were surely at an end, and perhaps thankful that they were not up on the gallows with with him. “Who will take my fiddle? Who will play for me at my wake?” Silence. No-one dared risked being seen as an accomplice of Jamie Macpherson. And with that he gave a cry of anger, snapping the violin in two and towing it into the crowd. The noose was placed around his neck… But then, perhaps even as the messenger, with his reprieve, approached, Jamie Macpherson threw himself off the step to his death: no man would be able to say they had hung Jamie Macpherson.</p>
<p>The violin, well, the violin, and Jamie’s huge sword, I believe they can still be seen, to this day, in a small museum in Banff, in Noth-East Scotland.  And in that town of Banff, from where Jamie was hung, well, the lairdship was stripped of its manorial right of managing trial and punishment. And in the town of Macduff, just over the estuary, I have heard said the facing wall of the clock tower there is blanked off; for the people of Macduff have not given the people of Banff, the time of day ever since that fateful day of November 16th, 1700, when Jamie Macpherson played his final lament.</p>
