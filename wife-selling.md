Wives, Custom of Selling. -Has there ever been any foundation in law for the practice of selling of wives, which our neighbours the French persist in believing to be perfectly legal and common at the present day? What was the origin of the custom?

An amusing series of " Notes" might be made, from instances in which the custom is introduced as characteristic of English manners, by French and other foreign writers. G. L. B.

Selling a Wife. — What is the origin of the popular idea, that a man may legally dispose of his spouse by haltering her, and exposing her for sale in a public market? Some time ago the custom appears to have been very prevalent; and only a few months back there was a paragraph in The Times, describing an occurrence of the kind at Nottingham.

French romancers and dramatists have seized upon it as a leading trait of English society; and in their remarkably-faithful delineations of English life it is not unusual to find the blue-beard milord Anglais carting milady to Sinithfield, and enlarging upon her points in the cheap-jack style to the admiring drovers.

SKI-LING A WIFE.

(Vol. vii., p. 429.)

The popular idea that a man may legally dispose of his wife, by exposing her for sale in a public market, may not improbably have arisen from the correlation of the terms buying and selling. Your correspondent V. T. STERNBERG need not be reminded how almost universal was the custom among ancient nations of purchasing wives; and he will admit that it appears natural that the commodity which has been obtained "per aes et libram" — to use the phrase of the old Roman law touching matrimony — is transferable to another for a similar consideration, whenever it may have become useless or disagreeable to its original purchaser. However this may be, the custom is ancient, and moreover appears to have obtained, to some extent, among the higher orders of society. Of this an instance may be found in Grimaldi's *Origines Genealogies*, pp. 22, 23. (London, 1828, 4to.) The deed, by which the transaction was sought to be legalised, runs as follows :

"To all good Christians to whom this writ shall come, John de Camoys, son and heir of Sir Ralph de Camoys, greeting: Know me to have delivered, and yielded up of my own free will, to Sir William de Payne, Knight, my wife Margaret de Camoys, daughter and heiress of Sir John de Gatesden ; and likewise to have given and granted to the said Sir William, and to have made over and quit-claimed all goods and chattels which the said Margaret has or may have, or which I may claim in her right; so that neither I, nor any one in my name, shall at any time hereafter be able to claim any right to the said Margaret, or to her goods and chattels, or their pertinents. And I consent and grant, and by this writ declare, that the said Margaret shall abide and remain with the said Sir William during his pleasure. In witness of which I have placed my seal to this deed, before these witnesses : Thomas de Depeston, John de Ferrings, William de Icombe, Henry le Biroun, Stephen Chamberlayne, Walter le Blound, Gilbert de Batecumbe, Robert de Bosco, and others."

This matter came under the cognisance of Parliament in 1302, when the grant was pronounced to be invalid.

Now, we may fondly believe that this transaction, which occurred five hundred and fifty years ago, was characteristic alone of that dark and distant period, and that no parallel can be found in modern imes (at least in a decent class of society, and recognised by legal sanction) to justify the lively French dramatists in seizing upon it as a trait of modern English manners. A transaction, however, came before the public eye a month or two ago, which, should you think the following record of it •worth preservation as a "curiosity of legal experience," may lead your readers to a different conclusion :

"A young man, named W. C. Capas, was charged at the Public Office, Birmingham, Jan. 31, 1853, with assaulting his wife. The latter, in giving her evidence, stated that her husband was not living with her, but was 'leased' to another female. Upon inquiry by the magistrate into this novel species of contract, the document itself was produced in court, and read. It ran as follows:

'Memorandum of agreement made and entered into this second day of October, in the year of our Lord 1852, between William Charles Capas, of CharlesHenry Street, in the borough of Birmingham, in the county of Warwick, carpenter, of the one part, and Emily Hickson, of Hurst Street, Birmingham aforesaid, spinster, of the other part. Whereas the said William Charles Capas and Emily Hickson have mutually agreed with each other to live and reside together, and to mutually assist in supporting and maintaining each other during the remainder of their lives, and also to sign the agreement hereinafter contained to that effect: now, therefore, it is hereby mutually agreed upon, by and between the said William Charles Capas and Emily Hickson, that they the said, &c., shall live and reside together during the remainder of their lives, and that they shall mutually exert themselves by work and labour, and by following all their business pursuits, to the best of their abilities, skill, and understanding, and by advising and assisting each other, for their mutual benefit and advantage, and also to provide for themselves and each other the best supports and comforts of life which their means and income may afford. And for the true and faithful performance of this agreement, each of the said parties bindeth himself and herself unto the other finally by this agreement, as witness the hands of the said parties, this day and year first above written."

Here follow the signatures of the consenting parties. The girl Hickson was examined, and admitted that she had signed the document at the office of a Mr. Campbell, the lawyer (!) who prepared it, and that his charge for drawing up the same was, she believed, 1l. 15s. The latter promised her, at the same time, that if the wife of Capas gave her any annoyance he would put in that paper as evidence. The magistrates, considering the assault proved, fined Capas 2s. 6d., and "commented in very strong terms on the document which had that day been brought before them." (See Birmingham Journal, Jan. 5th, 1853.) Has a similar transaction come before the notice of your correspondents?

I may add that we are informed by the Birmingham Argus for March, 1834, that in that month a man led his wife by a halter to Smithfield Market in that town, and there publicly offered her for sale. WILLIAM BATES.

Selling a Wife (Vol. vii., p. 602.).— A case of selling a wife actually and *bona fide* happened in the provincial town in which I reside, about eighteen years ago. A man publicly sold his wife at the market cross for 15l.: the buyer carried her away with him some seven miles off, and she lived with him till his death. The seller and the buyer are both now dead, but the woman is alive, and is married to a third (or a second) husband. The legality of the transaction has, I believe, some chance of being tried, as she now claims some property belonging to her first husband (the seller), her right to which is questioned in consequence of her supposed alienation by sale ; and I am informed that a lawyer has been applied to in the case. Of course there can be little doubt as to the result.

Notes on Wife- Selling. — Can we blame our neighbours across the Channel for thinking us a nation of wife-sellers when, ignorant of our manners, and with feelings embittered bv a long war, they read such paragraphs as the following?

"A fellow sold his wife, as *a cow*, in Sheffield marketplace, a few days ago. The lady was put into the hands of a butcher, who held her by a halter fastened round her waist. 'What do you ask for your cow?' said a byestander. 'A guinea,' replied the husband. 'Done,' cried the other, and immediately paid the money, and led away his bargain. We understand that the purchaser and his cow live very happily together." — *Doncaster Gazette*, March 25, 1803.

"On Wednesday a most disgraceful scene took place in Pontefract. A fellow of the name of Smith brought his wife from Ferrybridge, and had her put up for sale by auction at the market cross, at the small sum of *twelve pence*; but after some *livberal* advances she was knocked off at *eleven shillings*. On the purchaser leading away his bargain in a halter, they were pelted by the populace with snow and mud, and retreated in more than *wedding haste*."—*Doncaster Gazette*, February 3, 1815.

This is an indictable offence. You will find on reference to 3 Burr, 1483, that Lord Hardwicke ordered a criminal information to issue against a gentleman (?) for making over his wife, by private contract, to another person. JURIDICUS

Wife-selling (1st S. ii. 217.; vii. 429. 602. ; viii. 43. 209. ; 2nd S. i. 420.) — The French believe we sell our wives at Smithfield; we call them blockheads for their ignorance of our manners. The following cutting from the *Stamford Mercury* of November 26, is worthy of the attention of all students of English civilisation:

"*Public Sale of a Wife.* — On Monday a disgraceful exhibition, the attempted sale of a wife, took place in front of a beerhouse at Shear-Bridge, Little Horton, near Bradford. The fellow who offered his wife for sale was Hartley Thompson. She was a person of prepossessing appearance. The sale had been duly announced by the bellman. A large crowd had assembled. The wife, it is said, appeared before the crowd with a halter, adorned with ribbons, round her neck. The sale, however, was not completed; the reason for this being that some disturbance was created by a crowd from a neighbouring factory, and that the person to whom it was intended to sell the wife (Ike Duncan) was detained at his work beyond the time. The couple, though not long wedded, have led a very unhappy life, and it is said they and their friends were so egregiously ignorant as to believe that they could secure their own legal separation by such an absurd course as this, — a public sale."

2nd. Series VIII, Sept 24, 1859, p258

Wife-selling (1st S. *passim* ; 2nd S. i. 420.; vi. 490.) — It seems that wives yet remain an article of merchandise in some parts of England. The following cutting is from the *Record* newspaper of August 26th:—

"Selling a Wife. — The disgraceful exhibition of selling a wife took place at Dudley on Tuesday night. Hundreds of people were congregated in Hall Street, the scene where the shocking spectacle was to be seen. The first bid was 1 1/2d., and ultimately reached 6d. Her husband, in his ignorance thinks — this repeated three times —she has actually no claim upon him.— *Daily Telegraph*."

Very quaint all this certainly is, and an admirable paragraph Mr. Froude would have written thereon had he, when collecting materials for his *History of the Reign of Henry VIII*., discovered that such a scene had been enacted in the then picturesque streets of one of our old county towns. The vivid picture we should have had of the strongwilled English people struggling, though sometimes abnormally, to break through the barriers that had so long retarded their free development, would have been worth anything; but it is not so pleasant to read of such a transaction in last week's newspaper. One wonders whether there are any magistrates in Dudley, and whether there was a policeman on beat in Hall Street or among the "large crowd" which another account says followed the vendor shouting after him. For the information of magistrates and policemen in that neighbourhood and elsewhere, it may be as well to reprint a paragraph that appeared in "N. & Q." 1st S. viii. 209.—

"West Riding Yorkshire Sessions, June 28, 1837.— Joshua Jackson convicted of selling his wife, imprisoned one month with hard labour."

WIFE SALE. — Some twenty-two years ago a working man living in Gloucester, finding that his wife, with whom he had lived uncomfortably a long time, had been unfaithful to him, obtained an interview with her paramour, to whom he agreed to sell her. Accordingly on the following Saturday (market day), attired in a black gown and a new white bonnet, with a halter round her neck, the frail wife was led by her husband into the market, where, it seems, a sort of auction was got up, and the woman, who was a consenting party to the transaction, was sold to her paramour for half a crown, the money being duly paid down by the "purchaser," who then led the woman away. I believe these particulars, as related to me by an eye-witness of the extraordinary (for so it was) occurrence are perfectly credible. The most singular part of the occurrence remains to be mentioned. The woman, it is averred, proved an excellent manager to her second lord, who frequently congratulated himself on his "bargain." It is possible that the woman is still living, but both the men are dead.

WIFE SELLING.

Many notes concerning this odious custom have appeared in these pages; they will be useful to the future historian. This practice has been so frequent during the last hundred and fifty years that we cannot blame foreigners for thinking that wife-selling is a publicly recognised national custom. I have conversed with more than one person who has seen a husband offer his wife for sale in a public street, with a halter round her neck. Even at the present day the vendor rarely receives any punishment for his brutality; indeed, magistrates and policemen are usually alike unaware that it is a breach of the law. The only case of a wife-seller meeting with his desert that has come under my notice, is recorded in "N. & Q." 2nd S. viii. 258.

I have met with the following instances of this crime during the last week. They have not hitherto appeared in these columns:—

"A man and his wife falling into discourse with a grazier at Parham fair, in Norfolk, the husband offered him his wife in exchange for an ox, provided he would let him choose one out of his drove. The grazier accepted the proposal, and the wife readily agreed to it. Accordingly they met the next day, when she was delivered to the grazier with a new halter round her neck, and the husband received the bullock, which he afterwards sold for six guineas." — *Gentleman's Magazine*, vol. xxxiv. p. 542.

"A young man in Bewcastle, Cumberland, who was not on good terms with his wife, resolved a few days ago to dispose of her by auction. Not being able to find a purchaser in the place where they resided, she persuaded him to proceed to Newcastle for that purpose. Accordingly they set out, and this modern Dalilah laid her plan so well, that immediately on his arrival a press-gang conveyed him on board a frigate preparing to get under weigh for a long cruise." — Evans and Ruffey’s *Farmer's Journal*, May 5, 1810.

"Our friends in the Principality are commonly supposed to have many strange customs, but to their credit we must state that the brutal custom of selling a wife is, as in England, a rare occurrence. Last week, however, a wife was sold at Cyfarthfa Iron Works, by one of the workmen to another, and the wife seemed more amused than, pained by the transfer. The price was 2l. 10s., and the understanding that an additional 10s. was to be devoted to beer. This arrangement having been carried out the parties separated, neither husband nor wife apparently regretting the termination of their marriage state." — *Leeds Mercury*, March, 1863.

"This barbarous occurrence actually took place in Merthyr Tydvil a few days ago between a workman of the Cyfarthfa Iron Works and another. The price for which the workman sold his wife was 3l. : 2l. 10s. in cash and 10s. worth of beer, the latter to be drunk by the principal parties in the transaction. The husband seemed very well satisfied that he had not only got rid of his wife, but also gained something in the bargain. As for the woman, she exhibited few symptoms of either shame or sorrow, and drank her share of the beer." — *Stamford Mercury*, March 27, 1863.

SELLING A WIFE BY AUCTION. — There have been several notices of wife-selling in your columns, but I do not remember seeing any account of the peculiar circumstances under which the custom became a settled legal point in the minds of the labouring population.

When the war was over in 1815, and great numbers of soldiers were disbanded, many of them found, on reaching what had been their homes, that, their wives had married again, and that a new family had sprung up to which the unfortunate soldier or sailor had no claim. In some of these cases certainly nobody was to blame. The wife had heard from more or less certain sources that her husband had been killed in such a battle, and after a decent interval had got another; all parties were in the wrong; all were to be pitied, but what was to be done? I don't suppose that the thing originated then, for such events must have occurred in former wars; but any way, the fact of taking a wife to the market, and selling her by auction, was considered as effectual a way of dissolving the *vinculum* as if it had been done in the House of Lords itself. The second husband became the purchaser for a nominal sum, twopence or sixpence, the first was free to marry again, and all parties were content. In the manufacturing districts in 1815 and 1816 hardly a market-day passed without such sales month after month. The authorities shut their eyes at the time, and the people were confirmed in the perfect legality of the proceeding, as they had already been satisfied of its justice.

It seems, however, not improbable that its origin would be found in times long ago, when women guilty of adultery were either put to death or sold as slaves.

Selling a Wife. — The following instance of wife-selling is recorded in the *Lincoln, Rutland and Stamford Mercury* for March 21:—

"At Hull police-court on Friday, James McMahon was charged with assaulting John Mills. It appeared that defendant bought of her husband for 2s. 6d. a young woman named Bottomley. The complainant, who had known the woman from childhood, having been born in the same village, tried to persuade her from entering upon such a disgraceful contract. Defendant thereupon knocked him down, and struck him when he was down. Not content with that, he seemed to be entirely without any sense of decency, and actually when he was in court seemed to be unaware that he had committed an offence against decency and morality as well as against the law. He appeared to be under the impression that he was the aggrieved individual, and that the complainant had no right to try to persuade the woman from doing what she was about to do. The defendant was fined 50s. and costs."

Wife Selling.— -In Mr. W. C. Hazlitt’s edition of Brand’s *Popular Antiquities of Great Britain* (ii. 63) is the following : —

"The superstition that a wife is a marketable commodity was entertained, to his misfortune, by one parson Cheken in the reign of Queen Mary; for in his Diary Henry Machyn notes, under the year 1553, 'The xxiiij of November, dyd ryd in a cart, Cheken, parson of Sant Necolas Coldabbay, round about London, for he sold ys wyff to a bowcher.’"

The superstition would soon die out if the turn of the market was always in the direction indicated in the old ballad below: —

"A jolly shoemaker, John Hobbs, John Hobbs,
A jolly shoemaker, John Hobbs;  
He married Jane Carter, no damsel was smarter.  
But she was a tartar, Jane Hobbs, Jane Hobbs,  
But she was a tartar, Jane Hobbs!  
He tied a rope to her, Jane Hobbs, Jane Hobbs,  
He tied a rope to her, Jane Hobbs;  
Like a lamb to the slaughter to Smithfield he brought her,  
But nobody bought her, Jane Hobbs, Jane Hobbs,  
But nobody bought her, Jane Hobbs!  
O! who wants a wife? cried Hobbs, cried Hobbs,  
O! who wants a wife? cried Hobbs;  
But somehow they tell us these wife-dealing fellows  
Were all of them sellers, like Hobbs, like Hobbs,  
Were all of them sellers, like Hobbs!"

"Wife Selling" (4th S. x. 311.) — Another version of the old ballad is given in *The Vocal Library*, 1818 (No. 1756), differing in several lines from your correspondent’s copy, and containing two more stanzas, which bring the ballad to a satisfactory conclusion.

It is as follows : —

John Hobbs.

"A jolly shoemaker, John Hobbs, John Hobbs,  
A jolly shoemaker, John Hobbs;
He married Jane Carter,  
No damsel look’d smarter,  
But he caught a Tartar,  
John Hobbs, John Hobbs,  
Yes, he caught a Tartar, John Hobbs.

He tied a rope to her, John Hobbs, John Hobbs,  
He tied a rope to her, John Hobbs;  
To ’scape from hot water  
To Smithfield he brought her,  
But nobody bought her,  
Jane Hobbs, Jane Hobbs,  
They all were afraid of Jane Hobbs.

Oh! who’ll buy a wife? says Hobbs, John Hobbs,  
A sweet pretty wife, says Hobbs;  
But somehow they tell us  
The wife-dealing fellows  
Were all of them sellers,  
John Hobbs, John Hobbs,  
And none of them wanted Jane Hobbs.

The rope it was ready, John Hobbs, John Hobbs,  
Come, give me the rope, says Hobbs,  
I won’t stand to wrangle,  
Myself I will strangle,  
And hang dingle dangle,  
John Hobbs, John Hobbs,  
He hung dingle dangle, John Hobbs.

But down his wife cut him,  
John Hobbs, John Hobbs,  
But down his wife cut him, John Hobbs;  
With a few bubble bubbles,  
They settled their troubles,  
Like most married couples,  
John Hobbs, John Hobbs,  
Oh! happy shoemaker, John Hobbs."

Wife Selling. — The custom of selling and purchasing wives is based upon the ancient laws of the Anglo-Saxons. If a freeman seduced the wife of a freeman, he was to pay his full *weregeld*, to buy another wife for the injured husband, and deliver her at his home. In the reign of Canute, this law received some modification; no guazdian could compel his ward to marry a man she disliked, and the money paid for her was to be a voluntaiy gift, and not a compulsory payment. — *Glimmerings in the Dark*, by F, Somner Merryweather, 1850, 8vo. p. 192.

A statement of the revolting custom is given in a treatise entitled, *The Laws respecting to Women as they regard Hmr Natural Rights*, London, 1777, 8vo. pp. 54-5.

There is a wittily written book, by a French visitor, entitled *Six Mois a Londrès, en 1816*, Paris, 8vo. 1817. Here, chap. xvii. p. 30, has the piquant heading, "A quinze shillings, ma femme!" and gives an account of a visit to Smithfield to study, by ocular inspection, the national custom. A seller soon presented himself, leading his wife by a cord, attached to her neck. Taking his stand, he began to bawl, "A quinze shillings, ma femme! Qui veut ma femme pour quinze shillings?" But all seemed in vain. "Beefs, veals, and muttons," disappeared about him, but no one wanted a wife. The poor man became hoarse, and was in despair; at last an "amateur" presented himself, who began to examine the wife, "comme il avait examiné quelques instans auparavant une jument que je l'avais vu marchander." The inspection was favourable, and he offered the price demanded. The husband still repeated his cries, "pour tâcher d'attirer des enchérisseurs," but none appearing, he pocketed the money, and the purchaser gave his arm to his new wife, who "paraissait avoir de vingt a vingt-deux ans, et était assez jolie."

France, itself, would appear to be not wholly innocent of the custom. According to the *Birmingham Journal*, of March 25th, 1865, a case of wife-selling had recently occurred at Maratz, near Lille. The price was a decent one, 126 francs, and a deed of sale and bill of exchange for the purchasemoney were duly drawn up. It appeared that neither buyer nor seller had any doubt of the legality of the transaction, and were much astonished when informed that they would have to answer for their conduct before the *Tribunal Correctionnel*.

For a case of wife-selling at Tipton, in Staffordshire, see the *Birmingham Daily Gazette*, June 5th, 1869, p. 5, col. 2. See also *Birmingham Daily Mail*, April 29th, 1871, for report of a case heard before Mr. Bruce, the stipendiary magistrate for Leeds. Here the wife had been sold to a man, with whom she had then lived for twenty-five years. In this case the customary ceremony of the "rope " had been omitted, and the purchaser was stated to "have stepped into the husband's shoes," a phrase, which may be taken metaphorically or literally, as the reader thinks fit.

Lastly, for it is useless to multiply cases, the *Daily Telgraph*, May 20th, 1872, records an instance, where it turned out that a wife had been bought "for the modest sum of one sovereign." The charge was for an assault, but the magistrate said that the conduct of all parties was disgraceful, and dismissed the summons.

Among other preceding papers on the subject, perhaps I may be permitted to refer to one by myself in "N.& Q." 1st S. vii 602.

Selling a Wife. — Perhaps you may think this cutting worth a place in "N. & Q." I have seen the several notices of wife-selling in "N. & Q.," but do not find a case like this, in which "the clerk of the market received 4d. for toll":—

"Sale Extraordinary. — On Saturday evening last, John Lees, Steel-burner, sold his wife for the small sum of 6d. to Samuel Hall, Eellmonger, both of Sheffield. Lees gave Hall one guinea, immediately to have her taken off to Manchester the day following by the coach: she was delivered up with an halter round her neck, and the clerk of the market received 4d. for toll. It would be well if some law was inforced to put a stop to such degrading traffic." — Morning Herald, March, 1796 ?

WIFE SELLING.— The early volumes of "N. & Q." contain many paragraphs concerning this practice. Students of the morals of the nineteenth century will thank you if you add the following to the number. I have cut the passage from the *Leeds Mercury* of May 26:—

"Selling a Wife at Sheffield.— At the Sheffield County Court yesterday an action was brought to recover 1*l*. 10*s.*, the cost of maintaining a married woman named Moore. It was stated by Mrs. Moore that on a night in January her husband came home bringing with him a married woman named Wood. She remonstrated with him for his conduct, and he thereupon kicked her out of the house, locking the door after he had done so. She was under medical treatment for a week in consequence of the injuries she then received. She subsequently became an inmate of the workhouse, and in March she went to the plaintiff's house, and had remained there since. The defence was that Mrs. Moore had been guilty of immorality, and that this was the cause of her husband having turned her out of the house. This, however, Mrs. Moore denied. The defendant was called, and, in the course of his cross-examination, he stated that he was now living with a married woman who was the wife of a friend of his. After being asked how he induced his friend to allow his wife to go and live with him, he replied, 'Well, he sold her.'— Mr. Fairburn (the plantiff's solicitor): 'May I ask what you gave for this precious article?'—The defendant replied: 'A quart of beer.' — His Honour adjourned the case for further evidence."

WIFE SELLING (6th S. iii. 487).— A very excellent article on this subject appeared in the Standard of May 30, in which the writer gave an interesting account of this vulgar error.

T. F. THISELTON DYER.

6th S. IV. Aug. 13, 1881, p. 133

Wife Selling (6th S. iii. 487, 512). — It is all very well for Mr. Thiselton Dyer to call it a "vulgar error" that a man may sell his wife; but we in the North and West Ridings know better. We know, in spite of the *obiter dicta* of "Her Majesty's High Court of Justice" (as the brand new phrase is), that men may properly and judiciously sell their wives, provided that they observe these three conditions, viz., — 1. The same wife must not be sold more than once by the same husband. 2. The price of the wife must not be less than one shilling. 3. The wife must be delivered to her purchaser with a halter — if possible a new halter — round her neck. The consent of the wife is, of course, taken for granted; experience having shown that it is never refused.

So recently as July 7, 1881, a case of the kind was reported in the local paper, as follows. William Dunn, of Ripon, was summoned before the beak, for instructing his son Thomas in his trade, although the Education Act had provided that he should not do this until Thomas had learnt certain other things which will be no manner of use to him. Mrs. Dunn, like a brave woman, came forward in defence of Thomas; whereupon the lawyers, always desirous of a side issue, suggested that she had been married to another man. This Mrs. Dunn at once admitted. "Yes, I was married to another man," she said; but he sold me to Dunn for twenty-five shillings, and I have it to show in black and white, with a receipt stamp on it, as I did not want people to say I was living in adultery."

These, I believe, were the *ipsissima verba* of Mrs. Dunn; and I venture to think that the exorbitant price (as it might appear to some) which her present husband gave for her was fully justified, not only by her timely vindication of him and his son, but also by her prudence in having evaded the breath of calumny by obtaining a properly stamped receipt for herself.

Another case, of which also I have direct local evidence, is not so recent. In a certain parish, which need not be named, there died, about three months ago, an aged native, one Job Skelton. He was a remarkable man; blest, in his youth, with a fine skill in poaching, and so vigorous and venerable in his old age that his photograph (I have it before me now) recalls the memory of Thomas Parr. His keen eyes and aquiline nose stand out clear in the midst of a wilderness of snowy hair and beard; and on either side his face a long lock of his hair, neatly plaited like a woman's, hangs down below his shoulders. Such a man, with sharp wits and a sense of humour, enjoyed great advantages; for the parish contains a famous abbey, and when "cheap-trippers" came up from the blessed railway to eat their "prog" there, they used to find this ancient being meditative among the ruins. Now, cheap-trippers belong to the class who have learnt from their School Board (and if any doubt this let them refer to the *Daily Telegraph* of July 23, 1881), that Magna Charta was a man who was banished to Italy by Henry VIII. Therefore, when reverend Job came forward, as he always did, and assured them that he remembered the abbey in its prime, they believed him; they listened with awe, as becomes true Protestants, while he recounted his "rare doings with the monks"; and finally they presented him with the very thing he wanted — a respectful tip.

All this, however, is parenthetical. What I had to say is, that about thirty years ago Job Skelton sold his wife Margery, who was perfectly willing to be sold, to a neighbour of his, a man named Lowther. He sold her for eighteenpence (a good price in those days), and delivered her properly in a halter. Mrs. Skelton now became Mrs. Lowther, and so continued during nine years, when it occurred to Lowther that he would like to marry somebody else, which he did. But I am happy to say that he was punished for this; his new wife turned out, as he expressed it after her death, "neither a first-rate wife nor yet a secondrate one"; and so he added, "Ah'll ha' nowt te deah wi' buryin' her." Margery, on the other hand, forsaken of her eighteenpenny husband, returned to her first love, Job, who received her (he had spent the eighteenpence), and retained her till she died, two years ago. He could not do otherwise, indeed; being precluded by Rule 1, above mentioned, from selling her again.

Poor Margery's funeral was singular. The parish is happy in having no access to hearses or undertakers; most people are carried to their last home, like William Rufus, in a cart; and so was Margery, with Job and the driver as her only mourners. To the surprise of the neighbours. Job appeared in his old moleskin poaching coat. They suggested "a bit o' black," but he replied, "Na, na! Ah ware this cawt when E gat her, an' Ah've put it on te side her in." Saying which he lighted his pipe and walked behind the cart. But the church was far, the road was long and hilly, and after a while Job mounted the cart, sat down on his wife's coffin, and stayed there, calmly smoking his pipe, until they reached the churchyard.

Wife Selling (6th S. iii. 487, 512 ; iv. 133). — The Brighton Herald of May 27, 1826, states that the Brighton Market Book recorded: " May 17, 1826, Mr. Hilton, of Lodsworth, publicly sold his wife for 30s., upon which the toll of one shilling was paid." The matter came to the knowledge of the magistrates, who sent for the toll collector to justify his strange conduct in charging toll ; when he at once referred the bench to the market byelaws: "Any article not enumerated in the byelaws pays one shilling" !

Wife Selling (6rh S. iii. 487, 512; iv. 133; v. 58). — The following brief account was taken down by me at the time, which was February, 1860. It relates to a village I know well in the North Riding:—

"The fine old English custom of selling one's wife was revived at about a fortnight ago. Vendor and purchaser are both labourers; the former an old man, the latter middle-aged. The purchaser had long thought of making a bid, and at length decided that the act was proper and lawful. 'Well,' said he to John, groom to of the Grange, "I've thought of it, and I'm right sure I can buy her, by law.' 'But,' said John, 'our master' ( -was at the Bar) 'says you cant.' 'Ah,' replied Hodge, 'your master's not seen much law lately; maybe he’s never read the new Divorce Act!' John being thus silenced, Hodge went to the old man, and offered him eighteenpence for his wife, who is a good deal younger than her husband. The price was at once accepted; and the woman, who was quite willing to be sold, was handed over to her new master, and is now living with him as his wife. Such, however, is the influence of modern refinement, that the whole village are indignant, and have even burnt the pair in effigy on the green. Poor things!"

"At the West Riding Sessions, June 28th. 1837 a man named Joshua Jackson was convicted of selling his wife, and sentenced to imprisonment for one month with hard labour. — On the 4th of Feb., 1806, a man named George Gowthorp, of Patrington, sold his wife in the Market-place of Hull for the sum of 20 guineas, and with a halter delivered her to a person named Houseman.— In 1815 a man held a regular auction in the Market-place at Pontefract, offering his wife at the minimum bidding of one shilling, and 'knocked her down' for 11 shillings. — In 1858, in a beershop in Little Horton, Bradford, a man named Hartley Thompson put up his wife, described by the local journals at the time as a 'pretty young woman,' for sale; he even announced the sale betorehand by means of a cider or bellman, and brought her in with a ribbon round her neck, by way of halter.... At Selby, in the month of December, 1862, a man publicly sold his wife on the steps of the marketcross for a pint of ale."

"A case was heard at Belfast this week in which a man named George Drennan was charged by sub-constable Baird with having assaulted his wife and a man named O'Neill. The woman was in hospital and O'Neill did not appear. The extraordinary feature in the case was that the prisoner had actually sold his wife to O'Neill for one penny and a dinner. There was a document drawn up between the prisoner of the one part and O'Neill on the other, treating (?) among other matters, that for the considerations mentioned, he had agreed to assign and transfer to one Patrick O'Neill all his right, title, and estate in his lawfully wedded wife— to wit the woman now in the hospital. The document was as follows:— "I, George Drennan, do hereby agree to sell to Patrick O'Neill my wife for the sum of 1d. and a dinner.' It did not appear the agreement had been fully carried out, as an assault had been committed, as alleged, on the recently sold wife of the prisoner."

(Privately printed, 57, The Grove, Hammersmith, W.) ... Mr. Waters gives an interesting note on wife selling, a mode of divorce which seems to have been once very prevalent a-nong our common people. The pages of "N. & Q." contain many examples of it, some of very recent date. A gentleman now dead, who was b^rn in the latter years of the last century, has told ua that he once eaw on market day, in a certain Eastern county, a man offer hia wife for aale with a hempen halter round her neck. Neither the constables nor the crowd interfered, and she waa disposed of for five shillings, going away contentedly with her new lord. ...

WIFE-SELLING.— The proper method of selling one's wife was discussed in "N. & Q." three or four years ago, and several recent cases in point were then cited. Perhaps, therefore, it may be worth while to add to these the following extract from a local newspaper, dated May 9, which has been sent to me:—

"Sale of a Wife at York.—We are informed that yesterday an unusual occurrence took place at an inn on Peasholme Green. A brickmaker sold his wife to a mattress-maker for the sum of 1s. 6d., which was at once paid, and the bargain concluded. Four of those present signed their names as witnesses of the transaction. This is the second occurrence of the kind in this city within a few weeks."

It will thus be seen that one at least of the two women who were sold fetched more than the standard price of one shilling, and also that the halter, which she ought to have worn, is not mentioned.

SMITHFIELD.— French travellers, when describing the moral and social aspects of England, rarely forget to inform their readers that it is customary in this country for men to sell their wives, like any ordinary chattle, in open market — a fact (for fact it appears to be) that we one and all repudiate. The following paragraph appeared in the part of the Wellington Journal published June 6:—

"A WIFE SOLD IN A HALTER.— On Monday, at Wakefield, in a case in which Samuel Eccles, a miner, of Allerton-Bywater, was summoned for the maintenance of his child, it was stated that defendant and his wife had been separated since June, 1887, and that the woman was sold in a halter in the Borough Market Hotel, Wakefield, for half a guinea, and went away with another man."

As a pendant to this I transcribe the following account from the Lady's Magazine for 1816:—

"SMITHFIELD BARGAIN. — One of those scenes which occasionally difgraco even Smithfield, lately took place there— namely, a man exposing his wife for sale. Hitherto we have only seen those moving in the lowest classes of society thus degrading themselves, but the present exhibition was attended with some novel circumstances. The parties, buyer and seller, were persons of property. The lady (the object of sale), young, beautiful, and elegantly dressed, was brought to the market in a coach and exposed to the view of her purchaser, with a silk halter round her shoulders, which were covered with a rich white lace veil. The price demanded for her in the first instance was eighty guineas, but that inally agreed on was fifty guineas, and a valuable hone upon which the purchaser was mounted. The sale and delivery being complete, the laDy with her new lord and master mounted a hand ome curricle which was waiting for them, and drove off, seemingly nothing loth to go. The purchaser in the present care is a celebrated horse-dealer in town and the seller a grazier of cattle residing about six miles from London. The intention of these disgusting bargains in to deprive the husband of any right of prosecution for damages."

"T' WIFE BAZAAR." — This, it would appear from Lady Catherine Milnes Gaskell's ' Prose Idyls of the West Riding' (p. 198), is the outcome of

"'a belief amongst the miners that it is lawful nough, in their own phrase, ' to sworp wives month o' May, and chose afresh for a whole year,' provided, as they put it, 't' other chap's wullin, and chap s missus wull go also.'"

I have read of wife-sales taking place in Yorkshire and elsewhere, and I think the legality of such transactions was maintained by some of my father's women-servants; but the privilege of "t' Wife Bazaar" is, as far as I am concerned, quite a latter-day revelation, and I am surprised that I have been left so long in ignorance. It appears that a contract is drawn up between the exchanging parties, who sign it at a public-house amid many witnesses and much feasting. That being over, the already wedded bridegrooms often bestow the gift of trinkets on their second-hand brides, whom they now maintain, together with the "childers" of the former union, should the agreement run to that effect. I did not know that "childers" could be found in any dialect; but Lady Catherine Milnes Gaskell uses it throughout her book. ST. SWITHIN.

" T WIFE BAZAAR": "CHILDERS " (10 S. ix. 207). — In The Home Counties Magazine, iv. 28, in an article entitled 'Notes on a Custom at Woking,' mention is made of a somewhat similar custom, lasting well into the last century, to that which has astonished ST. SWITHIN. The chief difference, apparently, is that it was the custom of the cottagers at Woking to exchange wives once a week, instead of once a year. The author declares that

"as morality is commonly understood, the district was a peculiarly good one, erring, if anything, on the side of narrow-mindedness;"

and he remarks in conclusion:—

"I venture to think that this is probably as important and complete an instance of the survival of the institution known as tribal marriage as can be found at the same period within the British Isles."  
ALAN STEWART.

I have never heard of such a "bazaar," but the "sellin'" and "swappin'" of wives amongst miners and others has often been noted in the newspapers in several Midland counties. This disposal or exchange of wives is not nearly so frequent as was the case, and those engaging in the transactions never seemed to doubt about their right to do so. The transactions usually took place at public-houses, and wives have been led the exchange with halters round their necks. In this, however, there is nothing new.

ST. SWTTHIN will find the word "childer" in common use in the West Riding of Yorkshie. I see it occurs in Hartley's 'Clock Almanac' for 1903, a pamphlet which happens to be at my elbow. Fifty years or so ago a very popular pit-song terminated with a refrain that ran: —

Come home! Come home to yer *childer* and me!

Oracle and the Daily Advertiser - Tuesday 11 February 1806

WIFE SELLING.—On Tuesday a most dis.„vraceful/scene was witnessed at Hull. A man named John Gowthorpe exposed his wife for sale in the market about one o'clock, but owing to the crowd which such an extraordinary occurrence had gathered together, he was obliged to defer the sale, and take her away. About four o'clock, however, he again brought her out, and she was sold for twenty guineas, and delivered in a halter to a person named Houseman, who had lodged with them four or five years. It reflects great disgrace upon the general police of the country, that such shameful scenes are permitted to be exhibited. From their frequency of late years, the common people , have imbibed an opinion that the. proceedings are strictly legal, and the bargain binding by law. The husband in the present case, expressed the deepest regret after he had disposed of his faithless wife.

WIFE-SELLING.—This barbarous custom, so repugnant to every moral feeling, and disgraceful to the Christian name, we are sorry to say has not totally dwindled into disuse. An instance of this kind occurred at the Market Cross, Leeds, last week, when a *tender-hearted* publican disposed of his rib, together with his stock in trade, for five guineas; as usual, in bargains of this nature, he actually transferred the abashed fair one *in a halter*, to a new husband!

*Wife selling Reversed.* On Wednesday last a disgraceful scene was exhibited at Dewsbury, which, however, had something of novelty to recommend it. A *lady* brought her hushand in customary form, with a halter round him, to the Market Cross and offered him for sale, in the presence of a numerous body of spectators. After some time a buyer appeared, and the novel commodity was disposed of for the mighty sum of sixpence. The parties then adjourned to a public-house, where they *moistened the bargain*, and afterwards parted all apparently well pleased with their own portion of the transaction.

*Wife selling.* —An instance of this unnatural commerce took place at Billingborough Tuesday se'nnight. Francis Worsdale, labourer, delivered (in the usual instrument—a halter) to John Crosbie, whittower, his nothing-loth rib for a 1*l*. note, a sum, which, without knowing either the merits or the beauty of the transferred lady, we, for our parts, should not be much inclined to give. She is, we learn, about 40 years of age, and has two children by Worsdaie, a boy and girl, the former of whom to remain with him, and the latter to follow the fortunes of her speculating mother and her new father. Crosbie is about half the age of his fair enslaver, and has but just finished his apprenticeship. It is not unnecessary to add, however prizeable the bargain may already appear, that he also receives one half of the goods and chattels of the late partners.

*WIDELY REPRINTED*

Wife-Selling. —The scandalous and illegal practice of husbands selling their wives in open market with a halter round her their `sic` necks, under the vulgar notion that they thereby get clear of the obligation of maintaining them, has of late years been too common. In many recent cases this abominable conduct has been punished with laudable severity. The proceeding, however, is not quite so modern is generally supposed. An instance is mentioned by Lord Coke, in which a husband endeavoured to dispose of his wife by *deed* and may perhaps amuse some our readers see a translation of it. The original is in Law Latin.— "Know all men this present writing, that I, John de Cameys, of my own voluntary will have assigned and set over unto William Paynell, Knight, my wife Margaret de Cameys, daughter and heiress of John de Gottesden; and also have given and granted, released, aud quit claimed to the said William all the goods and chattels which the said Margaret has or in future may become possessed of, and also whatever I possess of the goods and chattels of Margaret with their appurtenances, that neither I nor any other person in my name shall in future claim any interest in the said Margaret, or in the chattels the said Margaret with their appurtenances. I will and grant, and by this present writing confirm, that the said Margaret shall be and remain with the said William during the pleasure of the said William. In testimony whereof I have to this present writing affixed my seal."—Lord Coke calls this a "wonderful and unheard of grant."

Star (London) - Saturday 21 December 1822

*WIDELY REPRINTED*

WIFE SELLING EXTRAORDINARY!

About half-past twelve, on Thursday se'nnight, the Public were attracted to Plymouth *cattle* market, in consequence of notice which had been previously given, that a man, at that time and place, was to *dispose of his wife by public sale!* The report which accompanied the notice stated that the *Lady* was not only young and handsome, but that she had *rode* to town in the morning *on her own horse*, of her free will and accord, and with consent of her husband, who was to act the part of auctioneer on the occasion; and that she would, moreover, in the course of a few days, succeed to 600*l*. which her then (and as it still happens, her present) husband could not touch. The concourse of spectators was immense, and they were not kept waiting long, the husband and the wife having appeared in the market-place exactly at the appointed time, the latter accompanied by the hostler of the Lord Exmouth Inn, Old Town.

The husband put *the article* up at once, and for bidders—"Five shillings" was the first "ten" the next—"fifteen" the third—and so on, until the hostler aforesaid bade "Three Pounds;" when to the evident disappointment of the auctioneer, as well as of the lady, two constables took possession of the goods, and with them the auctioneer, and carried them both directly to the Guildhall, where the Chief Magistrate was then sitting. The parties were placed before the Mayor. The husband, named Brooks, and who resides at or in the neighbourhood of Ivy Bridge, on being asked why he had committed so illegal an act as to attempt the sale of his wife in the way he had been doing? he very innocently said—"They were both willing, and he did not think there was any harm in doing it—they had not lived together for a considerable time—they had been married about two years and a half, and she brought him a child *'three weeks after marriage!'* which, until after it was born, he never knew anything about; that the child soon after died; that he got a coffin for it, paid the expenses of the funeral, and put it *comfortably* out of the way, without ever reproaching his wife with her conduct; but all would not do. She soon after deserted him, notwithstanding his kindness, and went to live with another man, by whom she had one child since, and, he was informed, she was again pregnant with another.

On being asked who had advised or told him that he could sell his wife? he said, many people in the country told him he could do it; and that in consequence of her coming to him and saying that a person would give him £2O, and take her altogether clean off his hands (£3 in hand and £17 more at Christmas), he had had her advertised for sale in Modbury, on three separate market-days, and had come to Plymouth that morning by her appointment to get the business finished.

The *Lady*, a good-looking young woman, stated, that she and her husband could not agree, and that in consequence, as she knew of a person who would take her, and give £2O for the bargain, she wished to get separated from him, and she had been told by different persons that the thing could be done, by public sale in the market-place on a market day.

On being asked the name of the person who was to buy her? she said it was *Kane*, and that he lived near Plymstock; she further said, he had disappointed her in not coming forward to bid as he promised, and that in consequence she had employed the hostler of the Inn where she put up her horse to bid for her if the price did not exceed £2O. She said she had left her own horse by the way on account of its having a sore back, and borrowed one in lieu of it of a person near Ivy Bridge, with whom she stated herself to be in habits of intimacy.

After a good deal of consultation it was determined upon that the parties should be bound over to answer the charge at the ensuing Sessions; but *their own* recognizances were taken, neither of them being able to find sureties.

WIFE SELLING. Considerable excitement prevailed in Chesterfield market on Saturday last, arising from a report that the wife of a man residing in the locality of Inkersal had been publicly sold. The affair was particularly exciting to the gentler sex, to whom it furnished a very fruitful source of gossip throughout the day. We understand the woman had been estranged from her husband in consequence of her unfaithfulness, and that he had written to her requesting a reconciliation. She, during the separation, had formed an intimacy with another individual, and declined to return to her lawful husband, who, finding that his entreaties were in vain, he requested her to meet him on Saturday last in front of the Chesterfield Town Hall for the purpose of having a mutual separation by disposing of her to the highest bidder. The woman, who was neatly attired and tolerably good-looking, was true to her appointment, but the husband never came. The object of the assignation soon spread amongst the market people until a great crowd had collected, and it became evident that the excitement consequent upon such a disgraceful scene was becoming unpleasant to the actors; consequently, the woman's paramour took the fair lady to the house of Mr Hearnshaw, in Gluman gate, followed by a large crowd, who hooted and yelled after them. The crowd became so oppressive that the woman and her paramour contrived to escape by the back way, and quietly entered, by the back premises, the house of Mr. Cox, the Fountain, where they drank their refreshment and remained *ingoc.*, whilst the crowd were Glumaan-gate, and until after they had dispersed. There was sale as was generally reported, the parties believing the absence of the lawful husband to be fatal to the legality of a auction.

We have received the following account of a "wife sale" at Wirkswonh, from a correspondent: -One of these brutal, absurd, and illegal exhibitions took place last market day, at Wirksworth. In the forenoon, a man, who was not known, went into a saddler's shop and purchased a new halter, without, however, stating for what purpose he required it, and shortly afterwards the same man called again expressing a wish, that the person who had sold him the article would step into the market to witness a bargain. The journeyman went out for that purpose, without the most remote conception of the kind of transaction he was required to witness, and in the public market-place, found a young woman standing near a stall, with the halter he had sold the man, in a noose, round her neck. At this moment the man took hold of the end of the rope, and handed it to another man who came up from whom he received some money, and the three walked off together, leaving the saddler almost petrified the nature of the bargain had been obligingly, but almost unconsciously witnessing. The sale was conducted with some degree of secrecy and decency, if indeed the latter word is in any way applicable to such a disgusting proceeding, and but six persons were aware of what was going on until conclusion of the busineas; immediately after which, the three contracting parties very sensibly themselves scarce, with whole skins. It is conjectured the parties came from a distance, as they did not appear to be recognidsed in the town.

THE WIFE SELLING CASE AT WOLVERHAMPTON.

It will no doubt be in the recollection of onr readers that a few weeks ago a paragraph went the round of the papers, to the effect that a man named Samnel Jones, residing at Wolverhampton, had sold his wife and three blooming children to an American adventurer for the moderate sum of £150. As was then mentioned the wife left her lawful husband, and with the three children went to live with her American admirer. It would appear, however, that a few days ago she repented of her bargain, and returned to the protection of Mr. Samuel Jones. Upon finding himself deserted, the American communicated with the husband, and informed him that if he conld persuade his wife to return to him he would give the husband an additional fifty pounds. The husband accordingly tried all his powers of persuasion to get the wife to leave him, and finding her quite willing communicated with our American cousin, who was in London. He went down to Wolverhampton on Saturday. He there saw the husband and wife, and it was arranged that the American, with the wife and three children, should leave Wolverhampton on Saturday for London, by the 7.15 p.m. train. The Yankee, to make sure of his prize, arranged with Mr. Jones that he should see them to the station, and upon the signal being given for the train to start he would hand him a £50 Bank of England note. The husband accordingly saw the American, his wife, and three children safe in the train, and upon it leaving the platform received a Bank of England note from his Yankee friend. The train had hardly left the station, when upon looking at the note he found that it was a simple £5 note. Finding he was duped out of £45 his wife and three children, he at once sent the following graphic telegraphic message to the police in this town:— " Tall thin man run away with my wife and three children, two boxes, two band-boxes, and a carpet-bag. He is an American, with a belt round him, with a bowie-knife in the belt and a revolver. They are going to London, but husband will be at Birmingham by the next train booked from Wolverhampton to New-street station. To be detained."

Upon Detective Inspector Tandy receiving the telegram he directed Detective Sergeants Spokes and Jenns to meet the train from Wolverhampton and look out for the American, the wife, and three children. These two active officers accordingly went to the station, and upon making inquiries of the railway officials found the husband in the cloak room, he having arrived from Wolverhampton by the express which reaches Birmingham about ten minutes after the ordinary train. The officers made further inquiries and found the American had arrived. They then went to the Dudley-street side of the station, where the husband saw the American, with his wife and children and the luggage, he being in the act of putting the latter in a cab. The husband, going up to the Yankee, said, "Well, John, how are you getting on?" to which he replied, "All right, I guess." Upon this the husband informed him that he had given him at Wolverhampton station a £5 note instead of £50 note, and he wanted the latter sum. Said the American, "Well, I guess it was a mistake," and taking a bundle of notes from his pocket handed Mr. Jones a £50 Bank of England note, which was passed to the detectives, who foumd it to be quite genuine. The husband then shook hands with his wife, and kissing his children wished them "good-bye," and, with a friend who was with him, went to the nearest liquor vaults, where he "liquored" with his friend. The last that was seen of the American was that he, with the purchased wife and three children, were "making tracks" for the London train, where, we believe, they safely arrived. —*Birmingham Gazette*.

PURCHASING A WIFE FOR A QUART OF BEER IN SHEFFIELD.

A case disclosing shockingly immoral conduct was heard at the County Court yesterday before T. Ellison, Esq., judge.—A Mrs. Henderson, Pyebank, brought an action against Henry Moore, of Dun street, to recover £1 10s., for four week's maintenance of his wife. —Mr. Fairburn and Mr. W. J. Clegg, represented the plaintiff and defendant respectively.—There was no denial of Mrs. Moore having lodged with the plaintiff, but the defence was that the defendant's wife had been guilty of adultery. On being sworn Mrs. Moore, deposed that on the evening of the 30fch of January, her husband came home with a married woman named Wood, and they had some beer there. Witness told him she would not have the woman the house, but he threatened to kill her if she attempted to turn the woman out. Mrs. Wood complaining of being tired, defendant fetched a pillow from the bedroom for her. Witness again remonstrated, and thereupon defendant kicked her and pushed her out of the house and locked the door. She was yery much injured, but managed to get to a neighbour's house. She was under a doctor for more than a week, and afterwards she became an inmate of the Workhouse. On the 18th March she went to lodge with the plaintiff, and had been there since.—Crossexamined, the witness denied having been guilty of improper conduct with a man on the night that she was turned out of the house.—Plaintiff and another witness having given evidence, Mr. Clegg addressed the Court, admitting that his client was living with a married woman. It certainly was a disgraceful state af things, and it was shocking that a court of justice should occupied investigating such a case. Still he contended, the defendant was not liable for the maintenance of his wife, inasmuch as she had behaved in an immoral manner. —Moore was then called, and deposed that on the night question he found his wife acting in an improper manner.—In crossexamination by Mr. Fairburn, defendant said he was living with the wife of one of his friends, of whom he had purchased her for a quart of beer.—Mr. Clegg rose to re-examine the defendant, but his Honour cast a doubt on the latter's credibility, and Mr. Clegg resumed his seat.—A witness named Wright was called in support of the defendant's contention, but there was an important discrepancy between his and the defendant's statement. —Mr. Fairburn said he endorsed all that had been said by Mr. Clegg as to the disgracefulness of the case, and he contended that the defendant was a man who should not be believed. The fact was Moore desired to get rid of his wife in order that he might continue to live with the woman whom he had purchased.—His Honour adjourned the case for week for the purpose of a Mrs. Beresford giving evidence, it being alleged that it was at that person's house Mrs. Moore misconducted herself.

Echo (London) - Monday 30 May 1881

THE SHEFFIELD WIFE SELLING CASE.

*The Standard* observes that if we desire to reach the foundation of the idea of wife selling, we must go further back than even the Longobard laws. We must seek for it in that remote period in the world’s history when a woman was considered, as she still is among modern savage tribes and in Moslem countries, in the light of a marketable commeodity. The father sold her, and the husband who bought her, when tired of bargain, re-sold his "chattel," to be, as Petruchio said of Katherine, "the ox, the ass, the everything" of another barbarian lord. In Babylon there was a regular wife auction, and until recemtly marriageable girls were literally brought to market at the fair of Nijni-Novgorod in Russia. A father, in early thmes, looked upon his daughters as valuable property, and hence the disrepute in which elopements were held, as mean attempts to steal a wife without paying for her. Dowries with brides were thought of only when society got so civilied that bachelors and spinsters were tolerated, and when the abandonment of polygamy left a surplus of females in the community. Accordingly, the ethnologist regards the Sheffield knife-grinder who sold his spouse for a quart of beer with keener interest than the paraochial authorities are likely to do. In the eyes of the Folk Lorist he is a "survival"—a remnant—of the boyhood of the world, and, like the stone axe and the kjökkenmödding, worthy of investigation as a relic of pre-historic times.

House of Commons — Monday

THE WIFE SELLING CASE.

Mr, T. D. SULLIVAN (H.R., Westmeath) asked the Secretary of State for the Home Department whether his attention had been called to a case tried before the Sheffield County Court on May 25, reported in the *Daily News* of May 26, in the course of which it transpired that a man, whose name is not given in the report, sold his wife to a married man named Moore for the consideration of a quart of bear, and whether having regard to the fact that such sales are not uncommon in England the right hon. gentleman would take such steps as may be in his power to remove the impression which appears to exist in some parts of England that the sale of wives is a legitimate transaction.

Sir W. HARCOURT, in reply, said: I don’t know whether the hon. member expects a serious answer to his question, I can find nothing in this affair except the casual utterances of a drunken ruffian finding excuse for his own immorality. (Hear. hear, "Oh, oh" from Irish members.) There was nothing like a sale that deserves the name at all, and I cenfess when I see the question with such a suggestion as is in the latter part of it, I have only to say that to refer to this as not uncommon in England, or to represent that there exists an impression that such is a legitimate transaction, is in my opinion at once a waste of the time of and an insult to the intelligence of the House. (Cheers, and "Oh, oh" from Irish members.) Every one knows no such practice exists, and that no such belief prevails, ("Oh, oh," from Irish mambers.) Well, if hon. members held a different opinion as to Ireland, I have nothing to say. (Hear, hear) I entirely repudiate the slur that would be cast on the people of this country by seriously regarding the language of a degraded ruffian as worthy of representing a universal practice and a belief deserving the attention of Parliament. (Cheers.)

Mr. CALLAN: In making his allusion to Ireland did the right hon. gentleman mean anything serious? (Laughter.)

Sir W. HARCOURT: No, I did not mean anything serious at all. In Ireland, as in England and Scotland, the practice is equally unknown, (Hear, hear)

THE ALLEGED WIFE SELLING CASE IN SHEFFIELD.

At the County Court on Wednesday before T. Ellison, Esq., judge, the adjourned case in which it was alleged that a wife had been sold for a quart of beer came on for hearing, The circumstances of the case were that Mrs. Henderson, Pyebank, brought an action against Henry Moore, of Dun street, to recover £1 10s, for four weeks’ maintenance of his wife. It was admitted that Mrs. Moore lodged with the plaintiff, but it was alleged that she (the former) had been guilty of adultery. Mrs. Moore said on the 30th January her husband came home with a married woman name Wood, and when she remonstrated with him for bringing Mrs. Wood with him he pushed her out, and she had lived with the plaintiff ever since. Before the Court, when the husband was examined last court day, he admitted bringing Wood with him, but said he purchased her for a quart of beer; and his own wife had been unfaithful to him. The case was adjourned for a week for the purpose of a Mrs. Beresford giving evidence, it being asserted that at that woman’s house Mrs. Moore committed the alleged offence.—On the former hearing Mr. Fairburn appeared for the plaintiff, and Mr. Clegg for the defendant.—When the case was called on Wednesday, Mr. said he had seen Mr. Fairburn, who explained that he would not appear.—His Honour said if he remembered correctly the evidence showed that the husband was an adulterer and the wife was an adulteress. —Mr. Clegg said that was so, and he wished to know if his Honou
r would give judgment or strike out the case.—The Judge: I shall strike out the case.—Mr. Judge: Yes. Clegg: That will allow parties to come again?—The Judge: Yes.

*And appearing widely in Scottish newspapers*

WIFE SELLING IN ENGLAND. There are some British manners and customs which are a puzzle to foreigners, whose ways are not as our ways, and the method in whose madness is rather different from ours. Some of those social problems which we as a nation present to people at a distance are undoubtedly based upon misapprehension as to John Bull and his domestic habits. It is a deep-rooted idea in the minds of our foreign neighbours, for instance, that Englishmen have a most unaccountable tendency to commit suicide, and that the month of November is the period most commonly selected for executing the "happy despatch." Another common notion is that Englishmen, when tired of their better halves, have a short and summary mode of getting rid of them. Putting a halter round the neck of the spouse who has become burdensome to her lord and master, she is led to Smithfield, or any other market where live stock is usually disposed of, and sold for what she will fetch, just as if she were a horse or a pig, the prices commonly current in these transactions being such trifling considerations as a shilling or a pot of beer. It is a fact which is beyond dispute that Englishmen are occasionally rendered so wretched and desperate by the force of circumstances that they are driven to that last resort of the hopeless—self-destruction, but it is assuredly far from being the case that a suicidal tendency can be regarded as a national characteristic. Again, it is a melancholy truth that at wide intervals a man is to be found so lost to all proper feeling as to be prepared to barter his wife in the manner just indicated, and who may perhaps feel that, in receiving a good swig of the English national beverage in exchange for a conjugal partner of whom he has become tired, he has had the best of the bargain. Such an occurrence does seem to have actually occurred recently at Sheffield; and it illustrates the very varied character of the matters with which Parliament is expected to deal, even at a time when Imperial questions of a very important nature are urgently pressing for legislation, that this alleged sale of a wife should have been brought under the notice of the Home Secretary, for the ostensible purpose of having the impression removed that this was a legitimate transaction. Of course it was an Irish Member who took the matter up—one of those irrepressible obstructives who are ever on the alert to bring up any conceivable thing that may have the effect of wasting precious time, and diverting the attention of Parliament from the more important business that presses upon it. Irish representatives do not find enough to engage their attention in the grievances of their own unhappy countrymen, but must also concern themselves in removing erroneous impressions that prevail among their Saxon brethren as to what are and what are not legitimate transactions. Probably Mr Sullivan thought that the calling attention to this Sheffield bargain might lead to one of these amusing episodes which Hibernian Members furnish in such abundance to the present Parliament. If this was his expectation, however, he must have been disappointed, as tho reply of Sir Wm. Harcourt to the question put was brief and pointed, and practically disposed of the matter without leaving an opportunity for further discussion. There was even a tone of severe and well-merited rebuke in the remark with which the Home Secretary closed his reply, that the matter was "unworthy the attention of the House, and the suggestion in the question was an Attempt to cast an undeserved slur upon the nation." This was undoubtedly the tendency which the asking of so silly a question would have, 

whether such formed any part of the intention of tho questioner or not. There are undoubtedly many persons in some of the more benighted districts of England whose ideas of the marital relationship are of the very haziest kind, and who are morally in so benighted a condition as to see nothing particularly objectionable in dealing in wives as in a marketable commodity; but bad as the case may be in this respect, it is certainly far from common to find resort made, even by the most dissolute of husbands, to such an excuse for gross immorality; and certainly there is no ground for supposing the belief anything like prevalent that such a proceeding as selling a wife, even when good grounds exist for putting her away, can afford a legal substitute for the more cumbrous, costlier, and less expeditious mode of bringing an action in the Divorce Court.

WIFE-SELLING IN SHEFFIELD AND ELSEWHERE.

ALFRETON AND CHAPEL-EN-LE-FRITH CASES.

How many generations of progress and enlightenmenf does take to abolish one remnant of barbarism. After all that has been said of our advances during 50 years, we might have thought that, at any rate, the British scandal of wife-selling was at last done with. But the task is Sisyphean, for once again "the stonme comes whirling back." In the Sheffield County Court no later than Wednesday, a fish dealer acknowledged that he had bought another man's wife at market. The woman was sold for 5s., to be spent in gin, and to make the marital bill of sale a legal instrument, was duly signed, sealed, and witnessed. With this arrangement everybody appears to have been satisfied; and though, of course, the moment either of them chooses to break the compact, or question its legality, its utter woithlessness will at once appear; until that happens the law cannot interfere. The mere fact that before a man's wife leaves him to live with another, the three go through a solemn farce, and celebrate the occasion in gin, while it would probably deprive the husband of any remedy for his wife's desertion, does not give the law any hold upon the immorality of the woman and her new partner. The misfortune is that until the parties are undeceived they are apt really to believe that their conduct has the sanction and their bargain the protection the law. This, at least, is the only explanation we can give of the tame acquiescence of the woman in the transaction. Some years ago the then Home Secretary, in reply to a question asked on the subject in the House of Commons, undertook, on behalf of Government, to do what lay in their power to disabuse the popular mind of a belief that such a sale constituted a legal divorce on the one hand, and binding on the other. At that date, several cases had occurred, mainly in the Potteries, where the rights of the lords of creation are sometimes exercised after a peculiar fashion. And of all these rights the idea that nothing more is required for divorce from bed and board than to take the wife and offer her at auction was one of the most deep-rooted. Public-house jurisconsults `sic` differed as to the exact forms demanded. Some regarded a rope round the woman's neck essential, and several insisted very loudly that the sale was not completely binding unless the chattel had been knocked down to the highest bidder. Disposal by private arrangement was unsound in popular law. The consideration varied. It was, however, never less than sixpence in coin or a quart of beer in liquor. It ran, however, all the way from this figure up to forty pounds and a supper, though occaaonaly the price of a wife has been known to sink as low as a bull pup and a quartern of rum. But, however they might differ as to details of procedure, all parties appeared to have regarded the matter as perfectly lawful. Indeed, in the case which attracted the attention of Parliament, nobody seemed to have any notion that it was an outrageous travestie of law until the chattel herself, being deserted by her second "husband," sued the first one, probably on the advice of a lawyer, for wifely alimony—and got it.

For some years, however, we have heard so little of these scandalous stains on our civilisation that the general opinion was that, like single combat and the judicial trial of domestic animals for offences against their masters, they had died out. The Sheffield story proves that we were a little premature in this good opinion of our species. Knowledge spreads slowly, but ignorance is tenacious of life. The truth is, that the singular notion which our French neighhours entertain regarding this feature in our domestic economy did not originate out of the depth of their inner consciousness. When George III. was King the custom was outrageously common among humbler classes of the English people. In 1802, for example, we read of a wife, a child, and "as much furniture as would set up a beggar," being sold at the market cross of Chapel-en-le-Frith for eleven shillings, and a month later of a Hereford butcher disposing of his helpmate for "one pound and a bowl of punch." John Gorsethorpe, of Hull, after postponing the sale owing to the lady not bringing the reserved price, finally let her go for twenty guineas, and delivered her in a halter to the purchaser. In 1807 we read that "one of those scenes which have of late become so common" was enacted at Knaresborough, a man having brought his wife, "equipped in the usual style, and sold her at the market cross for sixpence an a quid of tobacco." A butcher seems to have been held as the proper agent when the husband himself did not act as auctioneer, for the woman had to be sold "as a cow," with a halter round her neck. These cases all date from the early days of the century, and seem to have occurred, for the most part, in the more benighted parts of the provinces. However, the "Annual Register" tells us that in 1820 "a decent-looking man" led his erring wife into Canterbury Cattle Market, and when the salesman declined to put her on the block, hired pen and soon afterwards sold her to a townsman for five shillings; and in 1834, a woman was sold in in exactly] the same manner. As late as 1858 a beershop keeper at Little Horton, near Bradford, not only sold his wife, but announced the auction several days in advance by means of the village bellman; and though, in 1837, the neighbours of a brute in the West Riding regarded him very ill-used in receiving a month's hard labour for his part in this rough and ready substitute for the Divorce Court, they were appeased on learning that the punishment was not so much for the immorality of the business as for the unnecessuy cruelty with which he dragged the recalcitrant wife to the market block. Scores of such cases might be cited. Five years ago, anAlfreton husband sold his wife for a quart of ale, and a few months later a Belfast man parted with his for one penny and a dinner, which cannot be regarded as such an extravagant price, unless, indeed, the wife was of a very inferior quality, or the dinner of Gargantuan sized portions. Curiously enough, instances of Smithfield being the scene of these sales are very rate. London was too near the ear of the law, or the Londoners were too civilised. But in a book published in 1816 a French traveller of some intelligence relates how he saw a wife disposed of in this market for fifteen shillings, though not until she was duly examined—"Comme il avait examiné quelques instans auparavant une jument que je l'avais vu merchander."

Such an idea could not, of course, have originnted out of nothing. Wife sale is reality what the antropologists know as a "survival" from the time when the husband regarded his wife—and was supported by the law in doing so—as Petruchio regarded Katherine, "my horse, my ass, my anything." She was his property. In 1749 a case came before Lord Hardwicke in which a wife had been assignedd by her husband, through the instrumentality of a deed, actually drawn up by a solicitor; and in 1853 the Birmingham Police Magistrate was under the necessity of sternly reproving a lawyer who had lent himself to a ?like fraud on his clients. In neither instance, however, was the erring attorney struck off the rolls. Indeed it is moee than doubtful whether, at an earlier date, such sales or assignments were accounted either illegal or immoral. In the thirtieth year of Edward the First's reign Parliament had to take into consideration the fact Sir William Paynel having "leased" the wife of Sir John De Camoys from her husband. The document, written in excellent lawyer's Latin, appears verbatim in Lord Coke's famous "Institutes." More than five hundred years afterwards—namely, in 1853—a very simiiar case, though with this differnce, that it was the husband who leased himself, came before an English Law Court, and may be cited as a curious instance of the vitality of a custom which is older than any Statute. As late as 1853 a woman who had been sold for fifteen pounds succeeded in defending her claim as the heiress to some property, against the plea of her first husband's relatives that the market place sale constituted a legal divorce. In truth, long before Sir Wm. Paynel leased Dame De Camoys, or the Sheffield fishmonger sold his wife, the rude world had been quietly buying and disposing of wives without any regard to the provisions of either the Civil Code or the Canon Law. Traces of this custom can be detected in the Pandects of the Netherlands and and Spain, and in the West Gothic and Longobard Laws. The Romans also made a difference between the Patrician marriage by "*confarreatio*" and the Patrician union by "*coemtio*", or purchase, and antiquaries insist on tracing, in the words "to have and to hold" of the marriage service of the Church of England, an allusion to the ancient idea of the husband possessing proprietary rights in his wife. If it were necessary to go further back, the habits of savage tribes might be adduced, and the wife market of Nijni Novgorod adduced as proof of the antiquity and persistency of the custom. The Sheffield hawker is therefore in good company. He is, however, a little behind the age, and for those who are so loth  to keep in step with an age, an Act making these mock marriages an offence punishable with the treadmill for all who take part in them, would not be amiss.— *Standard*. *Specifically: [London Evening Standard - Monday 30 May 1881](https://britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000183/18810530/030/0005)*

THE WIFE SELLING- CASE IN SHEFFIELD.

At the Sheffield County Court this day his Honour Judge Ellison gave judgment in the case of Hall v. Smithies. This was an action brought by Hall, wholesale fish dealer, Sheffield, against Jessie Smithies, landlady of the White Horse Hotel, Grammar-street, Walkley, for goods amounting to the value £282s.6d., which it was alleged had been illegaily detained by the defendant. The facts were fully reported in the *Telegraph* last week; and it will be remembered that this was the case in which the "wife-selling" transaction came out. —His Honour, in giving judgment, commented severely on the evidence given by some of plaintiff's witnesses, and said that if he did not order a prosecution for perjury it was for other reasons tnan any doubts in his mind as to whether perjuiy had been committed. He gave judgement for the defendant, but, at the same time, defendant gave his evidence in such a very objectionable way that his costs would not be allowed. It might be that, notwithstanding what he had said about the facts of the case, that the money had been returned, but that did not affect the decision.
